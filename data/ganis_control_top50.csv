Accepted English Tests and Scores Required
The University requires all applicants to demonstrate competence in the English language at a very high level before they begin their proposed course of study.
Whether or not you have to take a language test set will depend on a number of conditions. You can find this out on the Postgraduate Admissions website.
You should always upload your most recent test certificate regardless of the level you have achieved, so that the Postgraduate Admissions Office can assess your language level.
Language Tests Accepted by the University of Cambridge
Not all of the following tests are accepted by all courses, and the required scores may vary - please check below for details.
IELTS Academic
The IELTS (International English Language Testing System) Academic is the University's preferred test. Details can be obtained from local British Council Offices.
We also accept IELTS online.
You should upload a copy of the score report or test certificate via your self-service; we can use this to verify your scores online. We no longer process test certificates sent to us on paper directly from the test centre.
TOEFL
We accept TOEFL for all courses, this includes TOEFL at Home.
You should upload a copy of the score report or test certificate via your self-service; we can use this to verify your scores online. We no longer process test certificates sent to us on paper directly from the test centre.
C1 Advanced
Some courses accept C1 Advanced. An overall score of 193 with no element lower than 185 needs to be achieved however applicants must also be assessed by the University Language Centre before admission can be confirmed.
Following assessment, the University Language Centre may advise further action from the applicant (e.g. enrolment at one of the Language Centre courses, or completion of an IELTS test).
C2 Proficiency
Some courses accept C2 Proficiency. An overall score of 200, with no element lower than 185 needs to be achieved.
You can find out what score you need to achieve on the Postgraduate Admissions website.
When to take the test
If you have already taken a test that meets the minimum level, you should upload the test certificate with the rest of your supporting documents when you make your application.
If you have already taken a test but it does not meet the minimum level, you should make arrangements to retest as soon as possible, and you should upload your current test certificate with the rest of your supporting documents when you make your application.
If you have not already taken a test, you should make arrangements to take the test as soon as possible. You may be required to retest and there can sometimes be long waiting times for a test place.
If you are made an offer to study, you will be required to provide the test certificate at the required level at least two months before the start of your course, and your admission cannot be confirmed without this evidence.
If you are made an offer to study on your proposed course, the Postgraduate Admissions Office may recommend a language assessment by the Language Centre and attendance on one of the ADTIS programmes – either the Pre-Sessional or the In-Sessional.
LC Assessment
One of the entry conditions for postgraduate study at the University of Cambridge for applicants whose first language is not English is that you pass an English language proficiency test to show that you have the necessary command of the language in order to get the most out of your course.
If you narrowly miss the required minimum level you may be referred by the Postgraduate Admissions Office to the Language Centre for a further assessment to be carried out. Please note that this only occurs in cases where the minimum level has only been missed by a narrow margin.
If you have a language condition and have been referred to the Language Centre for an additional assessment, then you will have been notified of this through your online Self-Service account on CAMSIS. In such cases, please e-mail adtis@ with the following information:

Assessment Procedure
The University's internal English language assessment consists of an online assessment which assesses reading, writing and listening, and also an interview carried out over Zoom. Not all applicants require a speaking assessment. Should you require one, you will be notified of this after you have completed your online assessment with details as to how and when to arrange this.
The assessment cannot be prepared for in the commonly accepted sense of 'prepare' - in fact, we would not encourage you to do so. The assessment is just that - an 'assessment' not a test. There is no specific score that you need to achieve. The assessment has been designed to assess your competency in academic English and the associated skills set - not your ability to pass a test.
On the basis of the assessment, the Language Centre will make one of five possible recommendations to the Postgraduate Admissions Office. These are:
For more details please refer to the next section on 'Explanation of Outcomes'.
Explanation of Outcomes
METCON
If the outcome is that you have met the language condition, then this means that on the basis of the assessment it is considered that your academic English language abilities fulfill the University's English language requirements for your course. Should you, however, feel at any stage during your time at Cambridge that you would like additional support for any aspect of academic English skills, then, you can of course register for the In-Sessional Support Programme.
PRE
If the outcome is that your language condition has been met on the basis that you attend the five-week intensive Pre-Sessional course that runs from mid-August to the third week in September, then this has been set since it is considered on the basis of the assessment that you currently have weaker areas which need to be addressed so that you can hit the ground running when you start your degree programme in October. Whilst students who have displayed minor inadequacies in their proficiency of the English language are set this as a condition, the overwhelming reason for mandating attendance of the Pre-Sessional is due to a lack of the prerequisite postgraduate academic English skills to ensure that students can fulfil the requirements of their programmes.
You can find out more about the Pre-Sessional by looking at our Pre-Sessional pages. The Pre-Sessional is not really a language course at all - but an academic skills training course tailored to the needs of international postgraduate students at Cambridge.
Please note that if your envisaged start date is not Michaelmas Term (i.e. not October), then the attendance of the Pre-Sessional is not an option. You may therefore be asked to retake one of the accepted English language tests and meet the University's minimum English language requirement for your intended course that way or you may have to defer entry until October so that you can attend the Pre-Sessional and fulfill your language condition that way. The Pre-Sessional must be attended before you start your degree programme.
IN, recommended PRE
If the outcome is that the language condition has been met, providing you attend the In-Sessional Programme, then this has been set since the assessment has shown up some minor weaknesses in your academic English ability for which you require additional support once you are in Cambridge. The cost of the In-Sessional, should you agree to attend it, will be included in your financial condition.
On the basis of the assessment, however, we would recommend that you attend the Pre-Sessional Programme to further strengthen your academic English literacy prior to starting your degree course.
Should you decide to attend the Pre-Sessional, then the condition to attend the In-Sessional will be removed
IN (In-Sessional)
If the outcome is that the language condition has been met, providing you attend the In-Sessional Programme, then this has been set since the assessment has shown up some minor weaknesses in your academic English ability for which you require additional support once you are in Cambridge. The cost of the In-Sessional, should you agree to attend it, will be included in your financial condition.
METCON-IN
If the outcome is that you have met the condition, but it is recommended that you register for the In-Sessional Support Programme once you arrive in Cambridge, then this means that on the basis of the assessment it is considered that your academic English language abilities fulfill the University's English language requirements for your course, but it is considered that you would benefit from additional support to further refine your academic English proficiency. This is, however, merely a recommendation and not a condition of entry.
Please see our webpage for more details 
REFUSE
If the outcome of the assessment is a refuse, then this means that on the basis of the assessment it is considered that your academic English skills do not meet the University's required minimum entrance levels for your intended course and that the margin is too great for us to be able to address these weaknesses sufficiently with the Pre-Sessional Course. In this case, you will be advised to retake one of the accepted English language tests and meet the minimum requirement that way.
Notification of Outcome
The outcome of your assessment will be available on your online application self-service page within 8 working days.
Queries
Please note that the Language Centre acts as an advisory body to the Postgraduate Admissions Office, whose responsibility it is for the setting and waiving of the language condition. Should you have any queries as to the outcome of your assessment, you should contact the Postgraduate Admissions Office.
Visa Applications
The Language Centre's English language assessment can be used in fulfillment of the language condition required to apply for a Tier 4 visa. Should you need to apply for a Tier 4 visa, then you will sent all the necessary documentation for your application from the University once you have completed all the conditions of your offer.
If you are made a conditional offer by the University, you should try and meet the conditions of your offer as soon as possible. On the International Students website you will find detailed information about applying for a student visa.
In addition, the time taken to meet your offer conditions and to obtain a visa has a particular impact if you must attend the Language Centre's Pre-Sessional course which starts in mid-August. Whilst the University will endeavour to move as swiftly as we can on our side and to get the necessary paperwork through to you as soon as possible so that you can apply for your student visa, it is of vital importance that you meet all outstanding conditions of your conditional offer as soon as possible. It can take several weeks to arrange a visa appointment.
Please be aware therefore of the lengthy nature of the procedures involved; and whilst the Language Centre will do what it can to expedite this process internally, there are numerous factors outside of the University's control - however, failure to meet any of the conditions of your offer will jeopardise your entry into the University.",5,87.9,University of Cambridge,11.5,100.0,20565,5,cam.ac.uk,95.8,2400:00,97.5,97.4,United Kingdom,"policy, administrative communications",4.446721366030398,0.266542750929368,2747,False,5

Introduction
The Executive Master of Laws is a part-time LLM specifically tailored for the needs of full-time working professionals. The ELLM is taught through intensive week-long modules at the LSE’s campus in central London, with students taking eight modules over a period of up to four years.

Information on Degree Program
The mechanical and plant engineering industry works innovation based on future challenges every day. Regarding the digital revolution, highly qualified engineers must develop solutions in the fields of industry 4.0, efficient processes and sustainable production. The aim of the Master Degree Course Mechanical Engineering is to educate students in fundamentals of engineering science and – according to that – in core competences to prepare them for challenges and their career. This enables them to find tomorrow’s solutions.
For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation:
Available specialization options are, e.g., materials science, thermodynamics or fluid mechanics. Moreover, by combining modules of different research areas in a targeted manner, students are enabled to develop highly individual cross-sectoral or sector-linking qualification profiles. For example, modules of the logistics sector may be combined with those of the energy sector or else aerospace modules may be combined with the medical engineering sector.
Upon completing the master's program in Mechanical Engineering, opportunities arise in many and various areas. These include mechanical, plant and vehicle engineering or, equally, the aerospace sector, as well as associated suppliers and service providers. Further opportunities arise in engineering consultancies.
The Master Degree Courseallows you to create your own individual study course plan. The Program is structured as follows:
- Master Modules, divided into main subject areas fundamentals of engineering sciences, core subjects of mechanical engineering, related areas and engineering science flexibilization
- Practical courses
- Supplementary Subjects
- Research Internship (term project, team project, practical research course)
- Key Competences (language courses, soft skills workshops, …)
- Master’s Thesis
The languages of instruction for this program are German and English. In addition to German-language modules, sufficient modules are offered in English, so that it is possible to complete the program both in German and exclusively in English; however, not all modules may be offered in both languages. For admission, you have to submit either a German language certificate OR an English language certificate.
Learn more about recognized certificates and other ways to prove your language skills.
The tuition fees for international students from third countries for this degree program are 6,000 euros per semester.
Many international students can have their fees waived or receive scholarships to finance them. You can find all information on waivers and scholarships here.
Please note: The semester fee as a contribution to the student union must be paid additionally. It varies depending on where you are studying. You can find all information on the semester fee here.

The Professorship of Societal Computing merges principles from computer science, social sciences, and ethics to explore and shape the impact of technology on society. It focuses among others on:
- The design and evaluation of human-centered technologies that are accessible and responsive to diverse user needs.
- The critical assessment of the social and ethical implications of emerging technologies, particularly in terms of equity, privacy, and societal well-being.
- The application of data science and analytics to understand and address societal challenges.
- The exploration of public policy and governance in guiding and responding to technological advancements.
Research topics that fall into the scopes of the professorship are:
- The Impact of algorithms on work, e.g. how generative AI impacts creators (e.g. writers, designers etc.).
- How to train and deploy multimodal foundation models that are culturally diverse and inclusive.
- How platforms and algorithms are used for political purposes (e.g. in campaigning, during election periods, but also for diffusing messages).
- And many more!

Reiterating the commitment expressed in the First, Second and Third Oxford Statements to clarify rules of international law applicable in the use of information and communication technologies;
Considering that information operations and activities conducted by States or non-State actors through information and communications technologies have the potential to cause harm to both States and individuals, in light of their ability to reach a very wide audience instantly as exemplified by false claims surrounding COVID-19 treatments, vaccines, masks and social distancing; false or distorted claims directed at manipulating electorates or altering perceptions of climate change and technological developments; and by the incitement of violence, especially during armed conflict and periods of instability;
Understanding that the expression ‘information operation[s] and activities’ encompasses any coordinated or individual deployment of digital resources for cognitive purposes to change or reinforce attitudes or behaviours of the targeted audience;
Such information operations and activities include the dissemination of disinformation, misinformation, hate speech, other types of harmful speech and methods for their dissemination;
Recognizing that, as noted by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Representative on Freedom of the Media, the Organization of American States Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information, in their 2017 Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and “Fake News”, Disinformation and Propaganda, “disinformation and propaganda are often designed and implemented so as to mislead a population, as well as to interfere with the public’s right to know and the right of individuals to seek and receive, as well as to impart, information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, protected under international legal guarantees of the rights to freedom of expression and to hold opinions” and that “some forms of disinformation and propaganda may harm individual reputations and privacy, or incite to violence, discrimination or hostility against identifiable groups in society”;
Emphasizing that, as referenced in Principles 11 and 12 of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, companies have a responsibility to respect the human rights of individuals, and affirming that this responsibility extends to the impact of information operations and activities conducted using their services;
We agree that:
1. International law applies to all conduct carried out through information and communications technologies, including information operations and activities.
2. States must refrain from conducting information operations and activities when they would violate the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention in a State’s internal or external affairs.
3. States must refrain from engaging in, supporting or allowing forms of speech within their jurisdiction that are prohibited under international law, such as any propaganda for war and any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. To enforce this duty, States must prohibit by law information operations and activities amounting to such forms of speech.
4. States must refrain from engaging in, or supporting, any other information operation or activity that violates the rights of individuals within their jurisdiction, such as their right to life, health, private life, freedoms of thought and opinion, freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, right to vote and participate in public affairs.
5. States must take measures to protect the human rights of individuals within their jurisdiction from violation by information operations or activities carried out by other States and non-state actors. Where such protective measures interfere with human rights, they must be in accordance with applicable legal requirements, such as legitimate purpose, legality, necessity, proportionality and non-discrimination.
6. In regulating information operations and activities, States must not unduly restrict the right to freedom of expression and other rights guaranteed under international law.
7. In addressing the impact of information operations, States must ensure that information and technology companies are able to operate their services consistently with the human rights of their individual users.
8. The conduct of information operations or activities in armed conflict is subject to the applicable rules of international humanitarian law (IHL). These rules include, but are not limited to, the duty to respect and ensure respect for international humanitarian law, which entails a prohibition against encouraging violations of IHL; the duties to respect and to protect specific actors or objects, including medical personnel and facilities and humanitarian personnel and consignments; and other rules on the protection of persons who do not or no longer participate in hostilities, such as civilians and prisoners of war.
9. Conducting information operations or activities will amount to international crimes, such as genocide, including direct and public incitement thereto, war crimes and crimes against humanity, where the elements of those crimes are fulfilled.
10. The application of the aforementioned rules of international law is without prejudice to any and all other applicable rules of international law that provide protections against information operations or activities.

Monday 23 June 2025, Strand Campus
King’s Academy’s look forward to bringing together colleagues from across King’s to share ideas, discuss current challenges in Higher Education and celebrate forward-thinking teaching and learning at our flagship event. Whether you’re presenting, joining a discussion or attending for inspiration, this is your chance to connect with peers and shape the future of education at King’s.
The conference will open with a welcome and keynote address from Professor Tansy Jessop. Tansy Jessop is Pro Vice-Chancellor for Education and Students at the University of Bristol, where she has led a programme of curriculum enhancement to re-imagine the design of programmes and assessment. The keynote address will explore practical assessment and feedback ideas to use across programmes to nurture agency, foster curiosity, develop human skills, and surprisingly, enable students to have more fun. By focusing on authentic and relational dimensions of assessment and feedback across programmes, she will argue that we can find better ways to assess students than retreating into closed book exams as a defence against Generative AI.
The keynote will be followed by four, one-hour session blocks where content will be presented as research/ scholarship presentations, interactive workshops, symposiums and poster presentations. We're pleased to share the 2025 programme showcases content from every King's Faculty and three Professional Directorates, with presenters in a variety of roles, including King's students.
The conference will conclude with a panel discussion where KCLSU, King's students and staff representatives will consider how we can work together to solve some of the critical challenges that are facing Higher Education. This includes, preparing students for their future careers, engaging with Generative AI as a tool to support learning and embedding sustainability in the curriculum. The panel will also discuss successes to date, such as student involvement in TASK (Transforming Assessment at King's), the King's 100 Panel and will consider how we can set a vision for partnership work that will build institutional resilience and collaboration for the future.
Content will be presented in five categories
Colleagues and students will share their experience or ideas of educational practices that prioritise both staff and student wellbeing and that foster a culture of empathy and support. Wellbeing is a growing concern for both staff and students. The number of students reporting mental health issues is more than 7 times higher than it was a decade ago, while as many as 50% of university staff may experience poor mental health. Within this context, it is critical that we discover and embed new ways of working which support staff and students from across the educational community to flourish at King’s. Content proposals in this category may focus on compassionate pedagogies that look to support the mental, emotional flourishing of students alongside their academic success. They may be focus on work to create an educational environment which sets staff and students up for success. They may focus on the wellbeing needs of members of our community, both students and staff across all roads, and how these can be supported with care and compassion.
Colleagues and students will share how they are responding to the needs, challenges or opportunities they identify as important to future developments. These may be in education for sustainability, digital futures, internationalisation, but are not limited to those. Presenters could set out the circumstances they anticipate, and what these imply for pedagogy, educational policy and/or learning environments. How should we respond to these developments and possibilities? Or what plans and projects are already underway?
Higher education needs to recognise and address circumstances that differentially disadvantage students for reasons outside their control. Colleagues will prompt and contribute to conversations about creating equitable and accessible learning environments, as we explore strategies and practices that celebrate diversity, accommodate varying needs, and enable the full participation of all students.
Within this theme, presenters reflect on opportunities – potential or existing – for our student community to shape their own educational journeys, and to propose ways in which we can foster meaningful partnerships, amplify student voices, increase student agency, and enhance their learning experience through collaborative engagement and co-creation.
Presentations will focus on curriculum design projects or curriculum research which addresses one of the themes listed below:
- What new skills, competencies or core knowledge have you embedded into your curriculum to better equip graduates facing uncertain futures?
- How did you go about identifying these learning outcomes and developing student learning towards these within your programmes of study?
- Has your work contributed to curriculum development beyond King’s, e.g. engagement with professional organizations or research associations and their curricular requirements or guidelines / subject benchmark statements?
- Applications of human-centred design to curriculum design within your discipline.
- Research projects into higher education skills development and links to labour markets or industry needs within your field.
- Research or scholarship on the social impact of higher education curricula. This could be within your subject discipline or more broadly.
Session Tags
In addition to indicating which theme each session aligns with, the following tags have been developed to help colleagues identify presentations that will be co-presented with King's students and where presenters recieved funding from a King's Academy funded call.

Education for Sustainability Fund: King’s Academy and King’s Climate and Sustainability will offer funds to embed Education for Sustainability (EfS) across our curricula. EfS brings together environmental, social and economic dimensions of your subject, and teaches those in a way that enables students to put their learning into action. The funding is designed to enable lasting curriculum change and could be used to develop teaching materials, learning activities and assessment approaches, incorporate interdisciplinarity, develop external partnerships and living labs, or evaluate your existing EfS.
-
Strategic College Teaching Fund: A local fund for each Faculty or Centre is allocated for projects that connect to strategic education priorities and that support the development of education scholarship by project leads/teams.
-
College Teaching Fund - TASK: This fund support the implementation of the Transforming Assessment for Students at Kings (TASK) framework as part of the major changes phase.

Criminal law is a major subject of academic and practical importance. This has always been so in England, where the subject has a rich history and occupies a very prominent place in popular awareness of the legal system.
The many questions raised by the use of criminal law as a means of social control continue to engage the attention of scholars in law and many other disciplines, to say nothing of politicians, policymakers, the judiciary, the legal profession and many other groups and individuals. New challenges are presented by the growth in terrorism, organised crime and money-laundering, all of which frequently occur across national boundaries.
In addition, in recent years criminal law studies have taken on a substantial European dimension, by virtue of the impact of the European Convention on Human Rights. The development of international criminal law and its associated tribunal jurisdiction has generated new issues and provided a further stimulus to the ‘globalisation’ of the subject.
A global outlook
As London’s global university UCL has recognised the significance of criminal law and its increasing international dimensions by the establishment of the Centre. The Centre stands alongside the Department of Crime Science, with its broad interdisciplinary focus on crime prevention, and its work similarly addresses including the issue of security in UCL's Grand Challenges research programme.
The Centre's work includes:
- the organisation of courses, conferences, seminars and lectures. The Centre has always had strong links with the legal profession. It is outward facing in all its activities and has a strong reputation for hosting events on topical, practical issues and attracting high calibre speakers from the professions and the judiciary.
- the preparation of responses to Government legislative proposals, Law Commission consultation papers, and other law reform proposals
- the building of networks of contacts with government departments, the judiciary, the criminal Bar, solicitors’ firms, the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, the Prison Service and other institutions and groups with interests in criminal justice
- co-operation with other universities with special interests in criminal law subjects, with a view to developing programmes of visits, staff exchanges, and collaborative research; increasing the profile of criminal law studies at UCL with the aim of attracting greater numbers of LLM and PhD students
- promoting cross-disciplinarity in the study of the criminal law. The emphasis on cross-disciplinarity has been evident in many of the Centre’s activities - members bring a wide range of research perspectives to include doctrinal law, theory, criminological and empirical research.",22,75.2,UCL,11.3,86.4,41110,22,ucl.ac.uk,78.4,2073:36,88.1,97.9,United Kingdom,"research materials, events, administrative communications",4.369443185673067,0.5620437956204379,419,False,22

This policy brief examines the UK’s path forward in building national capability for generative AI, focusing on leveraging existing strengths in safe and ethical AI development rather than competing in foundation model development. The brief outlines policy recommendations for supporting an ecosystem of AI applications while prioritizing human safety and flourishing.
This policy brief addresses three key questions regarding the UK’s approach to generative AI development and governance.
Key Research Questions
- What policy infrastructure and social capacity does the UK need to lead and manage deployment of responsible generative AI (over the long term)?
- What national capability does the UK need for large-scale AI systems in the short- and medium-term?
- What governance capacity does the UK need to deal with fast moving technologies, in which large uncertainties are a feature, not a bug?
Key Findings
The research revealed several critical insights:
-
UK should focus on becoming a leader in applying generative AI rather than building foundation models
-
Existing national strengths in safe and ethical AI should be leveraged
-
Supporting startups developing AI applications is more strategic than competing in model development
-
Human safety and flourishing should be at the forefront of innovation
-
Increased understanding and access to AI tools throughout society is crucial
Policy Recommendations
Based on extensive research, the brief recommends:
-
Create policy infrastructure for responsible AI deployment
-
Develop governance capacity for fast-moving technologies
-
Establish an AI Bill with clear ethical framework
-
Support ecosystem of AI application startups
-
Increase public understanding and access to AI tools
Collaborative Approach

English language requirements: the King's minimum requirements for postgraduate law programmes are listed in Band B at: 
The deadline for applications to the programme is 12 February 2025 (15:00 Italian time GMT+1).
Students apply to the dual degree programme via the Bocconi website. They will be evaluated for admission first by Bocconi. Following an initial shortlisting of applicants by Bocconi, King’s will review the applications. The two admissions offices of Bocconi and King’s will make final admissions decisions on all shortlisted candidates.
Upon being admitted to the programme, students will be required to submit an application form to King’s in order for their details to be fully registered at that institution.
Personal statement and supporting information
The selection process is based on the evaluation of a dossier submitted to the Bocconi application portal including:
Students will spend their first semester at Bocconi and their second semester at King’s taking taught modules, and then complete with an internship, placement or thesis with Bocconi and a dissertation with King’s.
This course is primarily taught at Bocconi University, Milan in semester 1 and at the King’s College London Strand and Waterloo campuses in semester 2.
At Bocconi, various teaching methods are used to facilitate effective learning and knowledge acquisition. Lectures are complemented with seminars to encourage active participation and in-depth exploration of topics.
In some modules, students will engage in group projects to foster the ability to work in teams, and use case study analysis to apply their knowledge, develop analytical skills, and make decisions.
Teaching on the King’s award LLM course is delivered through a combination of lectures and seminars. Some modules may be delivered as two hours of seminar-style teaching a week, whilst others may be lecture-based or a combination of lecture and seminars. Overall, students will usually have 6 to 10 contact hours a week.
Typically at King's, one credit equates to 10 hours of work.
Assessment
At Bocconi the assessment is mainly conducted via written exams that include answering open questions or writing an essay. Some modules’ assessments might also be based on presentations and quizzes.
At King’s your performance will be assessed through a combination of coursework and examination. Forms of assessment may typically include essays, examinations, presentations, reaction papers or other assignments.
The study time and assessment methods detailed above are typical and give you a good indication of what to expect. However, they are subject to change.
King's College London is regulated by the Office for Students.
Structure
Courses are divided into required and optional modules.
Required modules
For both awards, all students are required to take the following five modules at Bocconi University in semester 1:
For the King’s LLM Award: You will normally take modules to the equivalent total of 180 credits for the King’s award of this programme. Students are required to complete a 60 credit dissertation, and in addition to the 60 credits of optional modules taken at King’s in semester 2, the marks for all the semester 1 Bocconi modules (except for Legal Tech) will be translated and recorded as a 60 credit King’s module and used in the final calculation of the King’s LLM award.
For the Bocconi LLM Award: In addition to the required modules taken at Bocconi in Semester 1, marks for the 60 credits of optional modules taken at King’s in Semester 2 will be used for the calculation of the final Bocconi Award. Students will also complete either: a curricular internship consistent with the educational objectives of the LLM; or ‘clinical work’ - a short-term assignment by an external partner focussing on specific subjects; or an individual research paper (final thesis) on a subject different to their King’s dissertation.
Optional modules
For both awards: in addition you are required to take 60 credits of King’s LLM optional modules in semester 2:
The range of optional modules may typically include:
King’s College London reviews the modules offered on a regular basis to provide up-to-date, innovative and relevant programmes of study. Therefore, modules offered may change.
Graduates are exceptionally well-positioned for elite career opportunities in the field, including prestigious positions within top technology law firms, coveted in-house counsel roles at leading tech companies, and influential roles in government, academia, and global organisations shaping the future of technology law.
Students will pay half of the overall fees for the year to Bocconi for study in semester 1 and half of the overall tuition fees to King’s for study in semester 2.
Payable to Bocconi (2025-26): €21,500 in the following instalments:
[1] € 2,500 + €32.00 Italian tax - on enrolment (non-refundable);

Entry requirements
Entrants to the UCL LLM must have ‘a good 2.1 with evidence of 1st class ability’ (or equivalent in other jurisdictions), and must provide evidence in their application of motivation, reasoning and analytical ability and communication skills.
'A good 2.1’ shall normally mean an average of at least 65% (or equivalent in other jurisdictions) across all years of study, and ‘evidence of 1st class ability’ shall normally mean at least one 1st class mark (or equivalent in other jurisdictions) over the entire degree.
We may be willing to consider applicants who are close to, but do not meet these quantitative criteria, where space on the programme allows. Such applicants must demonstrate that they excel in motivation, analytical and reasoning ability and communication skills. This needs to be demonstrated across the personal statement and the written work. Applicants with less than an average of 62% (or equivalent in other jurisdictions) across all years of study, will not normally be considered under these criteria.
You need a law qualification to be considered for the LLM, i.e. Bachelor of Laws (LLB), Juris Doctor (JD), Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL). In exceptional circumstances, graduates without a law qualification but with work experience will be considered, however, experience must be relevant and a minimum of five years. This is a very uncommon route onto the programme.
Graduates whose first degree is not in law will be considered for admission if they have an average of 65% across all years of undergraduate study, plus an average of at least 65% plus at least one mark over 70% in the Graduate Diploma in Law recognised by UK professional bodies (achieved or in progress). Alternatively, graduates whose first degree is not in law will be considered if they have an average of 65% across all years of undergraduate study, plus have successfully completed studies on a Solicitors Qualifying Examination full time programme of at least 12 months duration, usually resulting in a Masters qualification equivalent to a Merit classification, with an average of 65% in all assessments including a pass in the SQE on first attempt.

Our alumni go on to work in a range of specialist legal areas, including major law firms, investment banks, academia, charities and local, national and international government. Examples include: Slaughter and May, Allbright Law Offices, Baker McKenzie, Cravath Swaine & Moore, DeHeng Law Offices LLP, Diageo, KPMG LLP, Ministry of Justice and Reed Smith LLP. (Graduate Outcomes Survey 2021-22).
Networking
The annual UCL Laws Careers Fair is an excellent opportunity to meet with employers and law firms before submitting applications for internships or training positions. Students can also attend events and talks hosted by UCL Careers, designed to develop employability skills and explore different sectors. The UCL Centre for Access to Justice co-ordinates a number of events to introduce students to careers in social justice or public interest related fields. The UCL Law Societies also run careers and networking events, giving you plenty of opportunities to make new connections and build valuable relationships for the future.
Teaching and learning
Our faculty home, Bentham House, was reopened in March 2018 following a major three-year redevelopment. The Grade II listed building has been significantly expanded and modernised, featuring new teaching and event spaces. At the heart of the building is a bright, five-story glass atrium that serves as a café and social hub for the entire UCL Laws community.
Modules in the LLM Law programme are taught through a mix of seminars, lectures, and tutorials. You will be expected to prepare in advance and actively participate in class discussions, especially during seminars and tutorials. You may also work in teams and deliver presentations to your class.
Each module is supported by a dedicated Moodle page containing materials such as reading lists, links to relevant websites and academic articles.
Assessment in taught modules is usually by examination, but may also include a coursework essay, or other methods of assessment, such as an oral presentations. Most assessments take place in term 3.
During the programme, you will research and write a 45-credit Research Essay which counts towards your final grade. You will be expected to select a research topic within your area of legal interest, or that relates to your specialism (if applicable). You will receive guidance and support through lectures and academic supervisors. The Research Essay is due at the end of term 3.
For full-time students, typical contact hours are approximately 2 hours per week for each taught module you are taking in any one term. Outside of lectures, seminars, workshops and tutorials full-time students typically study the equivalent of a full-time job, using their remaining time for self-directed study and completing coursework assignments.
Most module assessments are completed during the April/May exam period, even for those taught in the first term. The 10-month LLM is a demanding and intensive course, so you will need to be prepared to fully commit to your studies from day one until the end of the programme.
Modules
-
Full-time students will study 180 credits (135 taught module credits and a 45 credit Research Essay) to complete the LLM, over a period of 10 months.

You would like to apply to a Master’s degree program at the Technical University of Munich (TUM)? Here, you will find all the information you need.
- Be aware of the general requirements for graduate studies and our assessment procedures.
- In the online application, you will be asked to upload all required documents for admission. Find out which documents you need, and prepare them beforehand – for example, you will need a letter of motivation or an essay in most cases.
You are applying with an entrance qualification for Master’s degree program acquired outside of Germany? Be sure to observe these additional steps before starting your online application:
The first step is the application via our portal TUMonline. Our application wizard will guide you step by step through the online application procedure. If you apply for more than one degree program, please submit a separate application for each program.
After submitting the online application, you can view its status any time in your TUMonline account.
Please note: We can only consider your application if you upload all required documents and submit the complete application within the application period.
All documents required for admission have to be uploaded in PDF format to the online application form. Depending on the degree program, the required documents include:
- Bachelor’s certificate and bachelor’s diploma. If you don’t have the required documents at the time of application, please provide your Transcript instead.
- your CV – please note that it has to be current and must not contain gaps. Feel free to use the template provided by the European Union.
- your passport
- where necessary, verification of language skills in German or English
- where required, letter of motivation, essay, etc.
- where required, preliminary documentation by uni-assist (see Special Requirements for International Applicants). If you have applied for a VPD but it is not yet available, you can confirm the timely competion of the application for the VPD by submitting our form instead. Yo can then submit the final document as soon as you receive it.
You do not have to submit any hardcopies before your application is reviewed and you receive an offer of admission. Please upload all documents to TUMonline before the end of the application deadline. Documents submitted via email cannot be processed.
Documents issued in German or English need not be translated. Documents not issued in German or English must be translated by a sworn translator into either German or English. Please merge both the original and the translation and upload them as one PDF file.
Only when all required application documents have been filled out completely and received by the specified deadline, will they be processed by the Admissions and Enrollment Office. Due to the large number of applicants the process may take several weeks. Check the status of your application in your TUMonline Account. You will also be notified about important updates to your application account via email, so be sure to check your email account and your spam folder regularly.
Master degree programs are subject to aptitude assessment. As soon as all required documents have been submitted and processed, applicants will receive an email including an invitation and useful information about the aptitude assessment procedure.
Aptitude Assessment is a two-step procedure:
- In the initial stages, the grades you obtained during your bachelor's program, as well as your written documents, will be evaluated using a point system. Depending on the amount of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted, rejected or invited to a 20 minute admissions interview conducted by the department. In some cases, telephone interviews are carried out for international students.
- The interview represents the second stage of the procedure and helps determine whether the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired course of study. You will find more information in appendix 2 of the Academic and Examination Regulations of your desired degree program.
You will receive an email confirmation of your admission to a degree program at TUM. The offer of admission will also appear in your TUMonline Account. So be sure to check your inbox, your spam folder and your TUMonline account regularly.
The admission procedure that follows your acceptance of admission will also take some time. Therefore, accept your admission offer as soon as possible! You can do this in your TUMonline Account. Upon accepting your admission offer, you have the option to download your admission notification in TUMonline.
If you have applied to more than one program and have not yet received an admissions offer for your preferred course of study, please wait to confirm your acceptance. Otherwise, please accept your study place in TUMonline as soon as possible. You can accept the study place by the enrollment deadline. But we recommend you do so before the semester begins, to complete the enrollment process by the deadline.
You have received an admission offer, but due to some reason have to postphone the start of your studies? Here you will find everything you need to know about reserving your spot.
As soon as you accept your spot, you will be able to submit the required documents for enrollment. Enrollment is the step that makes you a student of TUM.
To complete your enrollment, we need all documents for enrollment in the correct form.
A list of the required documents will be displayed in your TUMonline account.
All documents not originally issued in German or English need to be translated. TUM does not assume any liability for unsolicited original certificates.
For some master's degrees, you may hand in your degree certificate until the end of the second semester, provided that you submit a transcript of records within the designated application period. To find out whether this is possible for a certain program, please consult the academic and examination regulations. If you wish to use your degree certificate as proof of your language skills, you necessarily need to submit it by the end of the application period for a program.
Please note: Consideration of whether an extended deadline can be granted is not possible until your application has been received.
More information:
After accepting your admission offer, please transfer your student union fees and, if applicable, the tuition fees for international students from third countries.

- To endeavour to ensure parity of treatment between applicants to the EAMC who share similar circumstances, whilst recognising that each case is individual.
- To be mindful of the interests of students taking the same examination but who are not applicants to the committee.
- To ensure that, particularly in relation to disregarding terms and repeating a period of study, an applicant is neither advantaged nor disadvantaged in comparison with other students
In addition to the EAMC there may be further groups who become involved in reasonable adjustments for some students. Some of these groups include:
- The Mitigating Circumstances Team is responsible for managing reasonable adjustment applications and implementing the decisions and outcomes.
- Colleges have direct contact with their students and are responsible for making the applications on their behalf. Colleges will also be involved in some operational aspects of implementing reasonable adjustments for their students.
- The Postgraduate Committee considers requests for reasonable adjustments for Postgraduate students on research programmes.
- The Counselling Service may offer support to students throughout the year and works alongside the Accessibility and Disability Resource Centre (ADRC) to develop self-help provision and guides.
- The ADRC work with students to consider and discuss adjustments and may produce a Student Support Document (SSD). The SSD is the basis on which many applications for reasonable adjustments are made – the trends and outcomes of which are monitored by the EAMC.
- The General Board’s Education Committee (GBEC) may also become involved in adjustments to examinations, and they receive a report from the EAMC.
Applications
Applications for Examination Allowances are considered on a case-by-case basis from requests from Colleges on behalf of their students who are on courses with a taught element, this includes the following courses: the Foundation Year, all Undergraduates, EMBA, LLM, MAcc, MASt, MBA, MCL, MEng, MFin, MMath, MMus, MSci and PGCE. Applications are also considered for certain Postgraduate degrees which includes the MPhil by Advanced Study, MRes, MEd or MSt degrees, the Diploma in Economics, the Postgraduate Diplomas in Legal Studies and in International Law, or the Certificate of Postgraduate Study (CPGS).
Where another body (such as Faculty, Department, or Student Union) presents a case for a student, the EAMC will direct the student to their College. Candidates should contact their College Tutorial Office if they are not registered for one of the above courses and need information on examination allowances.
The purpose of the EAMC is to consider the cases of students relating to applications for:
- examination access arrangements (including alternative forms of assessment)
- coursework extensions of more than seven days
- examination allowances (for students unable to undertake all or part of an examination, or who have failed all or part of an examination, due to illness or other extenuating circumstances);
- consideration of non-standard combinations of papers;
- disregarding terms (for students forced to be away from Cambridge for medical or other extenuating circumstances).

The University of Edinburgh's world-class LLM in Medical Law and Ethics helped me grow tremendously as a lawyer and personally.
This programme draws on the expertise and tradition of Edinburgh to deliver an internationally-focused, interdisciplinary programme that combines flexible learning with the most up-to-date teaching on all of the important issues affecting medicine, law and ethics today.
Medical law is a fascinating field of study as advances in medical research and new technologies shift the boundaries of medicine. New health issues are emerging and patient rights are increasingly taking centre stage. New and complex medico-legal dilemmas arise in clinical practice, in the realities of human health, and in the relationships between patients and healthcare professionals.
The programme enables you to explore the international and interdisciplinary dimensions of medical law and ethics. You will have opportunities to examine healthcare policy and the regulation of medicine in different parts of the world. You will also evaluate responses to technology and debate possible futures for medical law.
Applications are welcomed from legal professionals and healthcare professionals, including doctors and nurses, and from all those with an interest in this area.
Our online learning programmes are delivered entirely online via a virtual learning environment. Learning and teaching takes place ‘asynchronously’. This means that you have the flexibility to log in at times and in places convenient to you, contribute your views and respond to others, and still maintain a sense of community with your fellow students across time zones.
To be awarded LLM Medical Law and Ethics you must successfully complete six courses, five of which must be core courses, and a 10,000-word dissertation during your chosen duration of study.
During your studies you will also have the opportunity to study up to two courses from different subject areas such as information technology law or international commercial law.
Please note the available choice of courses in any given year may change.

We link to the latest information available. Please note that this may be for a previous academic year and should be considered indicative.
Having studied the programme, you will emerge with an understanding of medico-legal issues not just in the legal context, but with a sound grounding in ethics, social and theoretical contexts.
This programme is suitable to prepare students for advanced research.
Graduates of our online distance learning programmes progress to a range of careers in Law and related legal fields, including work in local and international firms, government legal departments, other public institutions, international organisations and in academia.

Introduction
LSE Law is the UK's pre-eminent research institution for law. Our academics are the authors of influential and often path-breaking scholarship, and many have globally leading reputations. As one of UK's largest law departments, with over 70 academic members of staff, LSE Law is well known for its interdisciplinary and contextual approaches to the study of law.
Our PhD Law programme offers the opportunity to undertake advanced legal research at one of the world's best law schools. Students in our PhD programme receive excellent training, and work under the supervision of leading scholars with strong international, comparative and interdisciplinary commitments. Our doctoral students become members of a lively academic community which is at the cutting-edge of legal scholarship and which plays a major role in the education of lawyers and law teachers from around the world.
Students in our PhD programme work under the supervision of two academics. We also provide specialised training for PhD students, both through our own training course and through courses run by other units of LSE, especially the Department of Methodology and the PhD Academy. PhD students are also welcome to attend any other LSE course, subject to the approval of the lecturer.
We aim to provide our PhD students with the opportunity to gain teaching experience, and also offer the opportunity to become involved with the organisation of mooting, academic conferences, pro bono work, and our working paper series.
Entry requirements
Our normal minimum entry requirement is a completed LLM degree or other master's-level qualification, awarded with an average mark of 70% (distinction/first class honours) or equivalent. Exceptionally, we may admit students who don't meet this requirement, where there is strong, alternative evidence of your suitability for our PhD programme.
Please select your country from the dropdown list below to find out the entry requirements that apply to you.
Although we accept applications from students who haven't yet completed their LLM or equivalent degree by the application deadline, we give priority within the admissions process to students who have already obtained the required grade by this date. Strong candidates who are currently completing their LLM/other master's degree may therefore wish to defer their application until they've received the requisite grade. Offers of admission and funding that are made to applicants who are currently undertaking their LLM/other masters degree are made on a “conditional” basis, meaning that the offer cannot be confirmed until the minimum entry requirement has been achieved. Conditional offers must be confirmed by the end of July of the year of entry at the latest. This means that current master's students who won't have their final grades/transcript by the end of July (including students on the LSE LLM degree) aren't eligible to apply to the PhD programme, unless they already hold another master's degree with the requisite grade.
It must be emphasised that meeting the minimum entry requirement doesn't guarantee entry. The PhD programme is heavily over-subscribed, meaning that the large majority of applicants who meet this requirement each year don't receive a place. We select students based on a variety of factors, including past academic performance, motivation for doctoral study, the viability of the applicant’s research proposal and its anticipated contribution to legal scholarship, the availability of suitable supervisors, and the diversity of the incoming PhD cohort, including diversity of subject-areas.
Research proposal
Your application should give us a clear idea of what you want to research and why.
You should state the general area in which you wish to undertake research, and provide a detailed outline of the specific questions you intend to investigate within that field. You should indicate the ways in which your proposed study would be a significant and original contribution to knowledge. You should identify the materials you expect to need, where you expect to find them, and the methods and/or framework of analysis you propose to use. Finally, you should explain how your proposed project is a good fit with other research work done within the Law School.
More detailed information on the admissions requirements for the programme, and guidance on what is required to form a successful research proposal is available in the LSE Law PhD programme FAQs page.

Your application
Overview
We welcome applications for research programmes that complement the academic interests of our staff at LSE. For this reason, we recommend that you take a look at our staff research interests before applying.
Applicants may wish to approach potential supervisors at the Law School to gauge their availability in a particular year and/or their willingness to supervise a specific research topic. However, you aren't required to contact potential supervisors before applying, and doing so provides no advantage in the admissions process. If your application is successful, two academic members of staff will be appointed to supervise you.
We carefully consider each application and take into account all the information included on your form, such as your:
- academic achievement (including existing and pending qualifications)
- statement of academic purpose
- references
- CV
- outline research proposal
- sample of written work.
See further information on supporting documents.
You may need to provide evidence of your English language proficiency. See our English language requirements.
In most instances, we hold a brief interview with shortlisted applicants as part of the admissions process. This is typically conducted by an applicant’s potential supervisors, it takes place virtually (eg, over Zoom), and it lasts about half an hour. The purpose of the interview is to further assess both the applicant’s motivation for doctoral study and the feasibility of the proposed research project. No preparation is required for the interview, although we recommend that you look over the material that you've submitted with your application beforehand.
Please note that LSE allows part-time PhD study only under limited circumstances. If you wish to study part-time, you should mention this (and the reasons for it) in your statement of academic purpose, and discuss it at interview if you're shortlisted.
When to apply
The application deadline for this programme is 1 December 2024.
However, if you’d like to be considered for any funding opportunities, you must submit your application (and all supporting documents) by the funding deadline.
See the fees and funding section below for more details.
Candidates are responsible for ensuring that any necessary supporting materials (eg, letters of reference sent by referees on their behalf) reach the LSE in good time, and are advised to start the admissions process as early as possible as a result.

Admission to degree programs at TUM is handled in several different ways. This page provides an overview of the admission procedures.
Be sure to inform yourself about the details of the procedure for a specific program in the academic and examination regulations or the regulations on the aptitude assessment or aptitude recommendation.
Unrestricted degree programs
Applicants will be granted admission to a program with unrestricted admission when
- the online application was submitted in time and complete with all required documents,
- and your documents have been reviewed.
Certain programs require that an internship be completed before the start of studies. When applying for a Master's program, the applicant's Bachelor's degree will be checked to confirm that it is accredited. This is especially true if the applicant is transferring from another university.
Aptitude assessment for Bachelor’s degree applicants
First, the applicant’s grade point average and subject-specific grades will be evaluated using a point system. Which grades are evaluated and how they are weighted depends on the applicant’s chosen degree program. Each program has a set of statutes that define the formula to be used. Depending on the degree program and the amount of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted or invited to an admissions interview or written test carried out by the school. The interview or test helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired degree program. For certain programs, the interview or written test is also intended to determine whether the necessary language requirements are met. For some programs, applicants below a certain point threshold may be rejected without an interview or written test.
Please note: In contrast to the Numerus Clausus programs, the number of spots available (capacity limit) is not fixed. We accept all applicants we feel are qualified. As such, no lotteries will be held after final selections have been made, and there will be no list of alternatives for unsuccessful applicants to claim unwanted spots.
Aptitude recommendation (SOV) for Bachelor’s degree applicants
Our Aptitude recommendation supports students in choosing the degree program best suited to their interests and abilities.
First, the applicant’s grade point average and subject-specific grades will be evaluated using a point system. Which grades are evaluated and how they are weighted depends on the applicant’s chosen degree program. Each program has a set of statues that defines the formula to be used. Depending on the amount of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted or invited to a mandatory, 20 minute interview carried out by the school. The interview helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired course of study. There is no written test.
The result of the interview determines whether the applicant receives a recommendation for the degree program. The purpose of the recommendation is to help students select the right program – it is, however, no mandatory requirement for admission.
Restricted degree programs (Numerus Clausus, NC)
NC degree programs have a fixed number of spots available, awarded primarily based on the applicant's grade point average and the amount of time the student has been waiting for a spot. This amount of time is defined as the number of semesters that have elapsed since completion of secondary studies and in which the applicant has not been admitted to a German university. Periods in which the applicant audited classes or studied abroad also count as waiting time. Applicants who are not admitted are automatically put on an alternatives list. These students may be admitted at a later date in the event a spot is not accepted by another student.
NC program eligibility will be based solely on the results of the past years. The grade point average of the last person to have been admitted constitutes the current NC standard. Since the number of applicants and their criteria (grades, waiting time, etc.) are unpredictable, it is still possible to apply with a lower grade point average than the current NC grades.
Degree programs with restricted admission
Please note: The application and admission for NC programs is coordinated via the dialogue-oriented service procedure.
Aptitude assessment for Master’s degree applicants
In the initial stage of this procedure, the grades you obtained during your Bachelor’s program, as well as your written documents, will be evaluated using a point system.
For some degree programs, the first stage of the aptitude assessment differs for applicants who have obtained their Bachelor’s degree in a country outside the scope of the “Lisbon Convention”: They have to take an online test. You can find out whether this applies to your desired degree program on the respective program page in the section “How do I apply?”.
Depending on the number of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted, rejected, or invited to a 20 minute admissions interview carried out by the school. In some cases interviews by telephone or video for international students are common. The interview helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired course of study. For some programs offered by the TUM School of Engineering and Design and the TUM School of Management a written test or the assessment of your academic qualification and your essay replace the interview.

Programme website: Intellectual Property Law
The LLM in IP Law has brilliant lecturers, wonderfully designed courses, stimulating 'intellectual' discussions, and students from all around the world.
This programme is designed to equip you with an advanced knowledge and understanding of intellectual property law and policy within a domestic (UK), regional (European) and international setting.
It will facilitate learning of both substantive intellectual property law, and the place and role of intellectual property, not just in its legal context but also in its social, ethical, cultural and commercial contexts.
The core courses will cover substantive law on all major intellectual property rights including:
- patents
- copyright
- trademarks
- designs
- common law protection of intellectual property rights
Courses also provide a critical understanding of topical issues and a broad range of perspectives on intellectual property law, practice and policy.
You must complete 180 credits of study - 60 credits are taken in the compulsory dissertation and the remaining 120 credits are taken in taught courses (of which a minimum of 80 credits must be taken from a list of core courses in intellectual property).
Courses will be led by members of the Law School academic community, who are leaders in their field.
You are expected to prepare in advance by reading the required materials and by reflecting on the issues to be discussed.
For the dissertation you will have a supervisor from whom you can expect guidance and support, but the purpose of the dissertation is to allow you to independently design and conduct a piece of research and analysis.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.
Find out more about compulsory and optional courses
We link to the latest information available. Please note that this may be for a previous academic year and should be considered indicative.
The subjects of the degree are intended to equip you with both an advanced knowledge of substantive intellectual property law and of the place and role of intellectual property within a domestic, regional and international context, laying a foundation for a specialised dissertation.
By the end of your studies for this degree, you will have acquired a high level of knowledge in the field of intellectual property law, a sophisticated awareness of the problems in the area and of the differing approaches to their solution.
Having studied the programme, you will emerge with an understanding of intellectual property law, not just in its legal but also social, ethical, cultural and commercial contexts.
During your study you will have access to the results of innovative cross-cutting research of the highest quality. The programme is suitable to prepare you for advanced research.
This programme provides excellent preparation for anyone seeking to work in intellectual property in a legal, business, industry, policy or academic setting, or who wishes to advance their knowledge in the field.
Recent graduates have entered legal practice as specialists in intellectual property law, and are also working in a range of areas such as the creative industries, information technology and life sciences.
These entry requirements are for the 2025/26 academic year and requirements for future academic years may differ. Entry requirements for the 2026/27 academic year will be published on 1 Oct 2025.

Structure and Organization
The program is offered on a yearly basis and is divided into 7 modules. The first five modules take place in Santiago de Chile, at the Heidelberg Center Latin America. The curriculum includes a three-month period (module 6) for the preparation of the master’s thesis. A final one-month stay takes place in Heidelberg at the Faculty of Law and the Max-Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law. During this time, students attend courses, complete their theses and take their final oral examinations. Exceptionally, the defense of the master’s thesis may be held in Santiago de Chile.
The LL.M. program follows a modular structure. Courses are conducted either in Spanish or in English, and are taught in presence. In exceptional circumstances, the program can be offered totally or partially online. Participants can also take courses on German as a foreign language free of charge at the HCLA.
Objectives
The Program aims mainly at offering a comprehensive analysis of current and prospective trends in the fields of international law in an era of globalization, international trade and investments and in the methods for arbitration and dispute settlement in these areas.
The program deals with the impact of globalization on the sources and subjects of international law, with recent developments in international economic law and the protection of the environment and State responsibility, as well as with relevant challenges faced by the international society over the last few years. The focus lies on most current topics related to the regulation of international trade, particularly the law of international trade, investments and dispute settlement. In this context, special attention is paid to international arbitration, procedures before the World Trade Organization and the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).
Graduate Profile
The LL.M. provides conceptual and practical tools to strengthen the professional skills of graduates, which qualify for positions in international organizations, governmental agencies in international economics trade and foreign investment, legal advice in the negotiation and implementation of international agreements, as well as in the field of external relations. Graduates are also trained to perform advisory activities on international investment, both in the private sector or in NGOs, as well as to perform international litigation and arbitration.
Video
Learn about the prestigious Heidelberg University, the oldest university in Germany, and about the HCLA, its cooperations in Chile and Latin America and the LL.M. program in International Law. Students and professors comment on their experiences and the singularities of this high-level international program.
Scholarships
The program has three prestigious scholarship systems:
- German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD): monthly allowance, allowance towards the tuition free, travel allowance, and partial expenses for the stay in Heidelberg.
- HCLA-Scholarships: tuition fee discounts for qualified cases
- Scholarship ""Women in International Law"": The program offers a scholarship of 50% reduction of the total fee for women with outstanding academic and professional backgrounds.
The DAAD, German Academic Exchange Service main function is to promote cooperation between German and international universities and research centers in different fields of study, teaching, research and outreach. Each year, the DAAD awards grants for transnational training programs (Translationale Bildung, TNB), through which the winning institutions (German universities) receive funds exclusively for scholarships for foreign students of academic excellence. Since 2008, our Master's program has received these funds. With the help of a bi-national commission with authorities from both universities, institutions involved and the DAAD law assistant, a selection of students who will be recipients of these scholarships for the corresponding year is made. The scholarship includes the payment of a percentage of the annual tuition fee, an amount for living expenses and a travel scholarship to Germany which includes a fixed co-payment for the airfare for the academic period in Heidelberg.
- Participants can also apply autonomously to other external funding programs or scholarships.

Stay in Heidelberg
The program includes a final stay in Heidelberg in the month of March. During this period, students attend two compulsory courses at the Faculty of Law of Heidelberg University and at the Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law, conclude their master’s thesis and their final oral examinations. The Faculty of Law of the Heidelberg University organizes guided tours and networking activities for the students.
The stay in Heidelberg opens us up to the world, because it gives us a closer approach to professors and the academic world in Europe.
Prof. Mariana Durnay, LL.M. graduate and lecturer in the program
The period in Heidelberg is extremely exciting. Students have the opportunity to be at the Max Planck and Heidelberg University’s Law School studying international law in a multicultural city with students from all over the world.

I had the opportunity to develop a broad and solid knowledge of International Law, while being supported throughout this journey by extraordinary academics.
This LLM is ideally suited to those wishing to specialise in public international law and offers you a firm foundation in the fundamentals of the international legal system and international relations.
The programme encourages and supports the development of independent thinking and research skills to prepare students for a career in international law or international organisations.
Courses will cover the theoretical basis for the development of international law, as well as exploring real-life examples and case studies on how rules and principles are applied in practice.
You must complete 180 credits of study – 60 credits are taken in the compulsory dissertation and the remaining 120 credits are taken in taught courses.
Courses will be led by members of Edinburgh Law School academic staff, who are leaders in their field. You are expected to prepare in advance by reading the required materials and by reflecting on the issues to be discussed, and your participation in classes will be assessed.
For the dissertation you will have a supervisor from whom you can expect guidance and support, but the purpose of the dissertation is to allow you to independently design and conduct a piece of research and analysis.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.
By the end of this programme, you should have acquired a more sophisticated understanding of the international legal system, international law-making processes, the diverse functions of international law in contemporary society, differing approaches to the subject, and a greater familiarity with research materials and methods.
This programme is suitable for professionally qualified lawyers wishing to practise international law, whether in law firms, at the bar, or as legal advisers in foreign ministries, other government departments, international organisations, or non-governmental organisations.
This programme may also provide the next step towards an academic career specialising in international law. It will also be of value to anyone seeking to develop a career in diplomacy, or international relations.
These entry requirements are for the 2025/26 academic year and requirements for future academic years may differ. Entry requirements for the 2026/27 academic year will be published on 1 Oct 2025.
A UK 2:1 honours degree, or its international equivalent, in law.
We may also consider a UK 2:1 honours degree, or its international equivalent, in international relations or another social science subject.
In evaluating your application for postgraduate study, greater emphasis may be placed upon results of prior learning in subjects relevant to the intended degree programme.
Entry to this programme is competitive. Meeting minimum requirements for consideration does not guarantee an offer of study.

These tools pose questions around how Imperial assesses students and ensures academic integrity, but they also present opportunities. For example, students can enhance the way they study, while as a staff member it is possible that you could spend more time on teaching than administrative tasks.
This introduction is intended as a short primer for generative AI, exploring some of the main points and areas relevant to using AI in an educational setting. Whilst you do not need a detailed technical understanding of this technology to make use of it, some understanding helps you understand its strengths, weaknesses, and the issues to consider when using it during your teaching.
This is a fast-changing topic. We aim to update this webpage regularly to take into account significant developments. Let's start by looking at various AI text generators, also known as Large Language Models (LLMs), and conclude with details regarding the responsible use of generative AI.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT has grabbed most of the headlines since its launch in November 2022. It was created by a company called OpenAI, which started as a not-for-profit research organisation (hence the name) but is now a fully commercial company with heavy investment from Microsoft. It is available as a free version, plus a premium version at £20 a month, which provides faster, more reliable access, as well as access to its latest language models and features, including plugins, which changes its behaviour significantly.
ChatGPT is based on a machine learning approach called ‘Transformers’, first proposed in 2017, and is pre-trained on large chunks of the internet, which gives it the ability to generate text in response to user prompts, hence the name ‘Generative Pre-trained Transformer’. Whilst OpenAI provided some information on the approach for training ChatGPT, they have not so far released any information about GPT4, the latest model released in early 2023.
In its standard mode, without plugins, ChatGPT works by predicting the next word given a sequence of words. This is important to understand, as it is not in any sense understanding your question and then searching for a result and has no concept of whether the text it is producing is correct. This leads it to be prone to producing plausible untruths or, as they are often known, hallucinations.
As it stands today, the free version of ChatGPT does not have access to the internet, so cannot answer questions beyond its training data cut-off date of September 2021. Users paying for the ChatGPT Plus service have access to a version that can access the internet.
ChatGPT Plus customers also have access to plugins which extend ChatGPT’s functionality. For example, a Wolfram plugin allows users to ask questions which are answered by Wolfram Alpha, which excels at mathematical and scientific information. Initial testing suggests this might resolve the issue of ‘hallucination’ in these domains. Many other plugins are available, and more are being developed.
OpenAI makes its service available to other developers, so many other applications make use of it, including many writing tools such as Jasper and Writesonic, as well as chatbots in popular applications such as Snapchat.
Microsoft’s Copilot, Google’s Gemini, Meta’s Llama and Anthropic’s Claude
Although ChatGPT has received most of the attention, there are other developers in this space, and this number is likely to increase. The developers of major AI services such as OpenAI make their services available to other developers. One of the most significant announcements has been from Microsoft, who are incorporating generative AI across Microsoft 365 tools under the name ‘Copilot’. All staff and students already have access to the platform. You can access additional guidance by visiting ICT's walkthrough webpage.
Google has made similar announcements about their office tools, and a number of their Google Workspace generative AI tools are available to try. Gemini is Google’s ChatGPT equivalent and is available for testing. Like Copilot, it can access the internet, but unlike Copilot, it does not provide references for the sites it has used to give its answers.
Claude is similar to ChatGPT and is produced by Anthropic, and is likely to be built into many applications going forward.
Meta’s Llama is slightly different in that it has been made available as an open-source model, meaning that you can run it yourself. Open-source AI models often differ from open-source software though, and it is not possible to fully understand how the Llama model works, or modify it yourself, from this release.
A summary of key capabilities, limitations, and concerns around Large Language Models
In considering generative AI, it is important not only to understand its capabilities but also its limitations. Some of the key themes are summarised here:
Image Generation
It is not all about text – image generation tools have made huge progress too, particularly with Midjourney, DALL-E and Stable Diffusion.
These work in a similar way to text generators – the user gives a prompt and one or more variations of images are produced. Image generation capabilities are being incorporated into general AI services, so Copilot, for example, can also generate images, using OpenAI’s DALL-E.
Approach to misuse of AI and plagiarism detection tools
Academic integrity is at the heart of all we do at Imperial. Students submitting work and assessments created by someone or something else, as if it was their own, is plagiarism and is a form of cheating and this includes AI-generated content. Please refer to the university’s Academic Misconduct Procedures for further information. To ensure quality assurance is maintained, departments may choose to invite a random selection of students to an ‘authenticity interview’ on their submitted assessments. This means asking students to attend an oral examination on their submitted work to ensure its authenticity, by asking them about the subject or how they approached their assignment. It should be made clear to students that being invited to an authenticity interview does not mean that there is any specific concern that they have submitted work that is not their own.
At this time, we do not intend to deploy any additional AI detection functionality due to concerns regarding the maturity of these products and their ability to accurately identify incidents of students utilising AI outside the parameters of what has been agreed for their programme.
Our current approach, in line with many other universities in the UK, is to train staff to understand AI, identify its various uses, set parameters for those uses within students’ programmes, and be alert to the common features of AI-generated work. In turn, students should expect to receive support from Imperial to help them proactively stay informed about the latest capabilities of AI platforms.
This approach is not prejudicial to Imperial deciding to review this decision in future, should we and the wider university sector have greater confidence in any technological solutions which may become available to detect the misuse of AI.

Project Description
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) describes a range of life-long neurodevelopmental conditions which is usually characterised by impairments in three core domains: social interaction, communication and imagination (known as triad of impairments). Today’s prevalence of ASD in the UK is more than 1 in 100 children.
Primary Supervisor: Dr Charaka J Palansuriya
Additional Supervisor: Dr Aurora Constantin (School of Informatics)
A high percent of the children with ASD have co-morbidities, including learning disability. Research revealed that children with ASD can benefit from the educational interventions. Particularly, technology-based interventions are very promising as children with ASD have affinity toward technology. In addition, technology has a series of advantages for these children. For example, technology acts an interface between individuals with ASD and other people and that creates emotional and social distancing which is likely to diminish the anxiety. Another advantage is that technology is well-placed to customise the interventions to the child’s particular needs and interests. Moreover, the autistic population is known as being extremely heterogenous. Thus, children with ASD have highly varying learning abilities. While children with Asperger Syndrome (one of the conditions included in ASD) have normal language and above average intelligence, other autistic children are completely nonverbal and present severe intellectual disability. Consequently, these children require personalised one-to-one guidance to learn both life-long skills and academics skills. Training adequate number of teachers and assistants to be specialised in providing this type of guidance is challenging to say the least.
While technology could provide support to children with ASD, given the heterogeneity of the population, it is unlikely that a software that works a predefined way could work well for all these children.
Currently, there is on going research at EPCC to use children’s Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) to identify when and how to, in real time, dynamically adjust the support provided to children with ASD when using a software based tutoring system [1]. With recent advancement in Generative AI technologies, personalised academic, social and communication related educational content could be dynamically generated in real time to support both children with ASD as well as Typically Developing (TD) children. Children themselves could participate in co-creating such content – for example, indicate what they like to learn and see in terms of text, images, animations and videos. This research would need to focus on fine tuning existing pre-trained generative AI models for generating content suitable for children. Also, this means that AI safety would be a key focus in this research.
Overview of research area
Generative AI technologies have made significant advancements recently that it is possible to generate human curated level content in terms of text, images, animations and even videos. ChatGPT and DALLE-2 are good examples of such generative AI technologies for creating new text and images respectively. However, both ChatGPT and DALLE-2 are closed source and mainly provide paid API level access when integrating into software applications. Restricting content for generating safe and suitable material for children would be based on what (if any) related API features available. Also, the input content will have to be submitted to a Cloud infrastructure operated by a commercial third-party entity (e.g., OpenAI/Microsoft). It is also possible to experience periods of service outage or high latency when generating content.
What this research will investigate is the use of open-source generative AI models and related technologies to generate the content for an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for Children with ASD. Stable Diffusion [2] provides an open-source technology similar to DALLE-2 for image generation based on text input. Open Assistant [3] is a similar generative AI technology to ChatGPT for generating human curated level text content. Also, an open-source version of GPT3 called GPT-J [4] is now available for generative AI based textual content creation. There likely be many more open-source efforts like these emerging in next few months. What this research will aim to do is to adapt these open-source generative AI technologies and their corresponding pre-trained models in a child-safe and coherent way to create content suitable for children with ASD and typically developing children. It is likely that some fine tuning of the models will be necessary with children specific datasets – for example, by using existing free stories available for children. In addition to the AI safety aspect, a research objective would be to create AI models that can be inferenced locally within a device itself – for example, within a laptop/tablet with powerful GPUs (e.g., laptop with NVIDIA GPUs or Apple silicon M1 or above macbooks/iPads). This means all data (including sensitive ones) stays locally within the device and does not need to be submitted to third party entities.
Potential research questions
- Could the open-source generative AI technologies and models be adapted to create content suitable for educational needs of children with ASD as well as typically developing children?
- What are the techniques required to implement required AI safety aspects when creating content for children?
- How could FER techniques be integrated to create suitable content in real time?
- What are the appropriate ways to perform and evaluate usability of the learning technologies developed?

The current developments in the field of artificial intelligence call for a reflection on what is technically possible and what has already been implemented - as has historically been the case with every major technical innovation. The Priority Area is intended to bring together measures at Heidelberg University that accept this challenge and consider, from the breadth of the humanities disciplines, what the technical innovations mean for the human world - also in their global and regional non-simultaneity. The aim is to enter into discussions with (AI) researchers from the social sciences, natural sciences, technology and life sciences from a humanities perspective and to be able to conduct joint research.
The Priority Area builds on the FoF 3 research focus areas “Linguistic Interaction and Physicality of Cognition”, “Knowledge Research with a Focus on Validity Issues”, “Transformation Processes” and the AI research at the Heidelberg Center for Digital Humanities (CAEDHET group). Ongoing funding measures such as the FoF 3-Thematic Research Networks “Digital Animism”, “ENACTING TRUST”, “Knowledge in Context” and the “Cognitive Science” network are thematically closely linked and will be included in the new network.
The following measures will be funded in Priority Area 1:
Summer School „AI and Human Values: Exploring technological, social, and normative perspectives“
The rapid development of generative AI is significantly shaping modern society. In this context, questions about underlying values and the ethical, legal, and social implications are increasingly being raised. The aim of the Summer School is to critically examine the normative foundations of generative AI and to discuss which values are embedded in its development and how these can be reflected and modeled. The Summer School offers an interdisciplinary space to connect perspectives (among others) from computer science, linguistics, philosophy, theology, medicine, and law. It is aimed at early-career researchers who wish to contribute to a deep discourse on values and norms in AI design and to build sustainable scientific networks.

TRN „AI & Translation: Comparing cognitive processes in the human brain to AI models – using the learning conditions of interpreters as a testing ground“
The project compares processes in Large Language Models to those of the human brain. Focusing on the abilities of information uptake, memorization and knowledge retrieval, we investigate the learning conditions of interpreters, who need to efficiently encode and consolidate new knowledge in special domains, to successfully produce target language while analyzing incoming source language. LLMs show strong linguistic skills but lack a memory component for efficient encoding, memorization and retrieval of knowledge. To overcome both issues we design new learning tools for interpreters and a dedicated LLM memory component, by combining the expertise of natural language processing, interpreting science and cognitive neuroscience.

Seed funding „Soziale Robotik und KI: Sprache und Kognition“
The project aims to establish a robotics language laboratory that combines social robotics and AI-driven technologies to develop new interfaces for psycholinguistic basic research and intervention research. The laboratory is intended to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and exchange among researchers from various fields such as linguistics, cognitive science, psychology, artificial intelligence, and ethics. This will advance basic research on human-machine interaction across diverse multilingual and educational contexts throughout the lifespan. In the long term, the goal is to create a sustainable infrastructure that enhances scientific exchange and supports the university's profile development in this pioneering field.
Project Lead: Prof. Dr. Adriana Hanulikova (German as Foreign Language)
Seed funding „Digital Voice“
The seed funding aims to establish an interdisciplinary group on the topic of Digital Voice that will elucidate digital voice phenomena such as AI voice cloning, digital assistants and video platforms. Understanding digital voice technology as the lead modality of the 21st century and analyzing its generative, socio-technical, communicative and philological conditions is a core topic for future collaborations between the humanities, social and technical sciences. The Digital Voice project aims at a theory-building and empirical reorientation of the concept of voice and its associated complexities of linguistic modality. The funds will be used to establish an interdisciplinary network in 2025. If successful, an application for a joint grant application will be developed and submitted in 2026.

Research network „Trust in the context of ‚healthcare technologies‘“
Trust is a social phenomenon that is increasingly being discussed in relation to technologies (e.g., AI, bio-engineering) and their associated expert systems (e.g., sciences, healthcare system). The goal of the interdisciplinary project is to connect researchers in middle and advanced career stages from all disciplinary groups whose research relates to phenomena of trust in the broader context of healthcare technologies. The aim is to form and establish a long-term research network that will serve as a discussion platform to identify cross-disciplinary research approaches through regular, interactive workshops within the framework of professional discourse. These discussions shall foster the development of joint academic publication projects and applications for third-party funded projects.

Seed funding: „From human to machine to human? Spiritual care in the digital space“
The project aims to gain a better understanding of person-to-person communication under the conditions of digitalization, mediatization and AI applications in the field of spiritual care. On the one hand, empirical research will be carried out into how spiritual care workers use digital tools and knowledge in the field of counseling and implement them in their counseling practice and what they lack for successful spiritual care in digital media. A competence model for digital spiritual care will be developed and tested in practice. Another aspect is the question of whether and in what way artificial intelligence can contribute to spiritual care. Here there are connections to the TRN “Digital Animism”. Reflecting on AI will help to discuss the peculiarities of human interaction, such as anthropological vulnerability or compassion and being affected by the suffering of others.

Financial regulators and central banks are increasingly integrating sustainability aspects into their operations. The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) mandates that ~50000 European companies will have to publish sustainability reports in the future, a great source of data for statistical analysis.
One particular challenge is that companies communicate their sustainability information through unstructured PDF reports that contain both numerical and textual data. To make this information amenable to quantitative research, GIST applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for data extraction.
Possible tasks include:

Dataset: Planning documents, which contain detailed information on the environmental condition, environmental risks, and necessary measures at the building level, as well as precise data on building type, height, and building density. Dataset of regional plans that outline requirements for urban planning. Additionally, there is the possibility to access flood maps, climate risk maps, etc., as well as court cases and lawsuits related to the plans. Federal states: NRW, Bavaria, and the Rhine-Main-Neckar region.
A specific research question can be developed in collaboration with the research team. The work requires an independent approach, an interest in interdisciplinary work, basic knowledge of sustainability and climate change topics, and good knowledge of German. There is the opportunity to offer a student assistant position as part of the Master's thesis. If interested, please send an email with a CV and a short cover letter to felicitas.sommer@ and bolei.ma@.
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks for evaluation. One area of interest is their application in handling multiple-choice questions, particularly those used in surveys with Likert scales to measure preferences, opinions, or similarity judgments. While LLMs demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, it remains unclear how consistent they are when faced with different variations of multiple-choice scales.
For instance, the same conceptual question may be presented with different response scales when asking how similar two given terms are to each other:
You will investigate these questions under well-defined experimental conditions. The empirical study will include but are not limited to data collection, LLM evaluation and consistency analysis.

Training machine learning (ML) models relies on annotated (or also called labeled) training data. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer great potential for data annotation. However, human annotations are likely still needed for difficult or ambiguous annotations. A reasonable collaboration setup of LLM and human annotators could assign the easier instances to the LLM and the more complicated ones to humans. This approach could reduce annotation costs and let the human annotators focus on the more ambiguous cases. Best practices for allocating annotation tasks between humans and LLM, in particular for subjective tasks, are yet to be developed. In this thesis you could develop and test algorithms for allocating tasks between the two annotators and study their impact on quality and cost. Indicators to route an instance to the human (expert ?) annotator could for example be a self-assessment of the LLMs certainty. If interested, please email your CV and a brief explanation of interest in the topic to ck@ and CC soda@.
The way in which an annotation task is structured affects the annotations that human annotators provide, a result called annotation sensitivity. For example, the order in which annotations are collected, and the number of screens, can change whether tweets are annotated as containing hate speech or offensive language ( With the growing use of LLMs as annotators, we wonder whether LLMs also show annotation sensitivity. Since LLMs are built on data produced by humans, it might be that the models inherit similar biases. In this thesis, you could replicate findings from the above studies with LLM annotators. If interested, please email your CV and a brief explanation of interest in the topic to ck@ and CC soda@.
We are seeking a motivated Master's student to embark on a methodological thesis project aimed at extending the scope of substantive-model compatible (SMC)-FCS multiple imputation (MI) techniques in discrete-time survival analysis (DTSA) to accommodate time-varying variables. Building on our existing work, which has successfully extended SMC-FCS MI for time-invariant covariates, this project will tackle the additional complexities introduced by time-varying variables. The successful candidate will conduct comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the extended methodology, and contribute to refining the practice of discrete-time survival analysis in the presence of missing data. If you are interested, please contact anna-carolina.haensch@.
The swift advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked both enthusiasm and concerns, with governments embracing the new technology for administrative efficiency, but also regulating it to protect the rights of citizens. To navigate this dynamic environment, policymakers require timely and dependable data on the attitudes of the population towards AI. Despite calls for research (e.g., Montag et al., 2024), no established short scale exists to measure these attitudes systematically within large survey panels such as the SOEP, which are an important foundation for evidence-based policy design.
Our research group is developing a concise and reliable scale to assess AI attitudes, examining variations across demographic groups in Germany and their impacts on technology acceptance or life outcomes such as career opportunities. Thesis students will collaborate with an experienced research team, gain practical skills in survey methodology and statistics, and contribute to an ongoing research project with a clear path toward academic publication.
We welcome applications from motivated sociology and statistics students with an interest in technology (policy) and public opinion research. A bachelor thesis would be more focussed on theoretical foundations, including a literature review and the design of a survey experiment with hypothesis building, while a master thesis would also have time to collect and analyze data from such an experiment, e.g., using factor and regression analyses.
Interested? Then reach out with your CV / transcript and to marcus.novotny@ & christoph.kern@ for a first meeting. We are looking forward to hearing from you!
Automated Machine Learning and Hyperparameter optimization techniques can be used to tune fairness-aware machine learning models that trade off predictive accuracy and a fairness measure (for example, equality of opportunity). However, a recent study challenges the assumption that there is a fairness-accuracy tradeoff, and suggests that only a few noisy samples per dataset are responsible for the perceived unfairness. When learning to abstain from such noisy samples using a bagging-based classifier, the study claims that standard models already produce fair predictions. However, this comes with the cost of having several data points not classified, and ideally, one would like to minimize the number of data points the classifier abstains from. The goal of this thesis is to find out if we can:
Alternatively, one can try to reproduce findings from other studies, such as the ones from Perrone et al. or Cruz and Hardt in light of these findings. If you are interested, please contact christoph.kern@, matthias.feurer@ and cc anna-carolina.haensch@.
Public agencies are increasingly automating the allocation of scarce public resources by making use of risk prediction models. While a wide range of studies focuses on bias in the application of such models, the long-term fairness implications of algorithmically assisted decisions are not fully understood. Building on the emerging literature of dynamic fairness, this project aims at studying feedback loops and the long-term consequences of algorithmic decision-making in social contexts. If you are interested, please contact christoph.kern@ and cc anna-carolina.haensch@.
ML methods are increasingly used in combination with ideas from the causal inference literature to explore heterogeneous treatment effects. Such approaches are useful, for example, for personalizing treatments in medicine or for selecting optimal treatment regimes in the delivery of welfare state measures. While topics such as explainability and transparency have already been studied in the past (see, e.g. policy trees), the connection of the causal learning literature to the fairML literature is still weak. However, it is well known that there are many biases present in data used for developing personalized treatments in medicine or in access to welfare state measures. Therefore, we seek students interested in exploring the connection between causal learning and fairML. If you are interested, please contact christoph.kern@, r.bach@, and cc anna-carolina.haensch@.
Research suggests that the successful integration of refugees and asylum seekers may depend on the location to which they are assigned, as certain locations may be better suited to certain refugee characteristics (Bansak et al. (2018)).
To this end, a number of algorithmic refugee location matching tools have been developed. These include tools such as GeoMatch and AnnieTM Moore. These tools use supervised machine learning to predict refugee integration outcomes in potential assignment locations. Further, they apply optimal matching approaches to strategically assign refugees to locations where the probability of a desired integration outcome is maximised.
Although the tools are designed to support rather than replace human decision-makers, they raise important questions about their reliability and fairness.
To this end, it is crucial to evaluate existing matching tools with a focus on fairness. For this purpose, extensive data from the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey on Refugees in the German Context (SOEP) will be used.

This thesis focuses on creating and adapting teaching materials on data literacy and evidence-based decision-making specifically tailored for church leadership. Drawing from established resources such as the Data Literacy and Evidence Building book, the project aims to design practical, accessible materials that equip leaders in church contexts to make informed, data-driven decisions in increasingly complex environments. The project will involve reviewing existing materials, and adapting them to the specific needs of church leadership under the guidance of Prof. Ongono and Prof. Wollbold from the Faculty of Catholic Theology and the guidance of Dr. Haensch from the Statistics Institute. It will also involve creating synthetic data as well as a selection of simple R or Python notebooks for training under the guidance of Dr. Haensch from the Statistics Institute. This work will contribute to strengthening leadership training by providing a foundation for data-informed strategies while respecting the values and unique challenges of church organizations.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), affecting over 15% of adults aged 50 and above, often progresses to dementia, underscoring the importance of early detection. This thesis project focuses on developing innovative, machine learning-based diagnostics for MCI using non-invasive data collection methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on extensive neuropsychological testing unsuitable for widespread screening, this project proposes the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze computer use behaviors, particularly mouse movement data.
Participants in a large Internet panel, engaging with surveys on various digital devices, will have their mouse movements recorded. This data will serve as the foundation for developing algorithms capable of predicting levels of cognitive functioning and identifying early signs of MCI based on how participants interact with standardized tasks and questionnaires. This project presents a unique opportunity for students to contribute to critical advancements in medical diagnostics, offering a cost-efficient, automated, and unobtrusive method to potentially delay the onset of severe dementia symptoms.

Company Law (40 credits, full-year course)
This course aims to give you a broad understanding of United Kingdom corporate law, including current changes; where appropriate, reference will be made to the position in Europe. The course seeks to develop awareness of the interaction between theory and practice, and the complex issues involved in balancing the needs of business and the community.
Contract Law in Europe (20 credits)
This course is a comparative contract law course. Its main focus is fundamental concepts of the law of contract, which arise in all systems. The course compares national systems of contract law, principally Scots, English, French and German law. The course also considers some of the harmonisation initiatives that have taken place in Europe over the last decade, principally the Draft Common Frame of Reference (Principles, Definitions and Model Rules of European Private Law).
Insolvency Law (20 credits)
This course examines selected issues of insolvency law, including personal and corporate insolvency. The course will primarily focus on law within the United Kingdom and will take an advanced look at a variety of topics. Theoretical and comparative law material from a variety of systems (in Europe and the Anglo-American tradition) will be used to examine the subjects studied.
You can select between 20 and 40 credits of the following courses:
Corporate Finance and the Law (20 credits)
Corporate finance law is essential for understanding how a business finances its operations and makes investment decisions in compliance with the legal and regulatory systems of its jurisdiction. This course is tailored for students who wish to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the theory and practice of corporate finance and UK corporate finance law.
Advanced Capital Markets Law (20 credits)
Capital markets law is important for understanding how the public authority defines and governs financial activities and services in national capital markets to facilitate business growth, protect investors, maintain market order and integrity, and control financial risks. This course is tailored for students who have acquired solid and comprehensive knowledge in UK company law or corporate finance law and wish to develop an in-depth and intensive understanding of the contemporary issues in UK capital markets law.
Principles of Financial Transactions (20 credits)
This course will look at the rules and practical aspects, as well as other relevant matters, relating to financial transactions, undertaken by banks/financial institutions. These transactions form a core part of a bank's/financial institution's activities, and are a major source of their profits.
Principles of Banking Law (20 credits)
This course deals with fundamental concepts of banking (and finance) law. Given the varied backgrounds of students on the LLM International Banking and Finance Programme - some have a legal background, whilst others have a finance/business/economics background - this course will seek to help students to undertake the International Banking and Finance Law Programme on an equal footing. This is because the topics studied in this course are fundamental ones regarding banking and finance law, and are relevant to other courses in the programme, i.e., the course looks at concepts that those dealing with banking (and finance) law need to know and understand.
Fundamentals of EU Competition Law 1 (20 credits)
The course will examine the concept of competition in economic literature and in the structure of the EU treaties covering common concepts: 'undertaking', effect on trade' and 'appreciable' effect, Articles 101 and 102. It will also cover competition law and intellectual property rights and digital markets, artificial intelligence and the enforcement of competition law.
Fundamentals of EU Competition Law 2 (20 credits)
The course examines three selected issues arising from the interplay between the rules on competition, contained in Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, and the principles governing the single market, especially the freedom of movement of goods and services. It will include:
- From the notion of restriction of freedom to trade to the concept of restriction of competition: the evolution in the approaches to the interpretation of Article 101 TFEU in light of the evolution of the single market;
- Parallel trade restrictions under the single market principles and under the EU competition rules;
- Intellectual property rights and the EU Treaties: from patent exhaustion to 'abusive' refusals to license; reconciling effective competition, free movement of 'valuable' inventions and the genuine incentive to invest and innovate.Principles of Corporate Finance Law (20 credits)
This course aims to develop a critical understanding of the principles of corporate finance law, with a special focus on some key subject matters of corporate finance: Formation of Capital, Share Capital Maintenance, Corporate Takeovers, Security Interests, Market Abuse and Short Sale.
Students taking this course will discuss the mechanics, structuring, and legal aspects of the selected topics. Throughout this course, students will acquire comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the principal theories, principles and concepts that underlie the corporate finance law. Students active participation and presentation is required.
International Commercial Arbitration (20 credits)
The course aims to provide a firm grounding in the legal aspects of ad hoc and institutional international arbitration as well as offering practical skills on how to conduct such arbitrations.
The course will include a range of topics including an introduction to arbitration, applicable laws, arbitration clauses, the arbitral tribunal, the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, the conduct of arbitral proceedings, the role of the national courts, the award, challenges to the award, and recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award. There will also be an introduction to Investment Arbitration. This course is aimed at those who are interested in acquiring a detailed understanding of how transnational disputes are resolved and knowledge of the legal environment which facilitates such a process. The primary focus will be on international commercial arbitration in practice, combining a thorough understanding of the legal rules with a practitioners' perspective.
Regulation of International Finance: the Law, the Economics, the Politics (40 credits, full-year course)
Global financial markets have gone through various stages of development since Bretton Woods. Crises, internationalisation, financialisation, technological advancement, and market and regulatory innovation have elevated financial markets to a position akin to being the heartbeat of the global economy. Especially, since 2008 the regulation of international finance has become the subject of extensive reform at the global, regional (EU), and national level.
This course examines the workings of global finance and the institutional edifice supporting it, based on modern regulatory theory and practice, from an interdisciplinary perspective. This offers a holistic and in-depth overview of the economic, regulatory, and political framework under which financial markets operate internationally but also (supra-) nationally.Principles of International Taxation (20 credits)
This course would provide an introductory coverage of international tax law, including the international tax landscape (and the conflicts it can create bilaterally and multilaterally), as well as international efforts to tackle tax avoidance. This course covers most of the topics prescribed for the Principles of International Taxation paper in the Advanced Diploma of International Taxation (paper 1 of the ADIT qualification).
- Competition Law, Intellectual Property and the Innovation Economy (20 credits)
This course explores how intellectual property (IP) and competition law shape and regulate innovation in modern economies. Students will analyze how IP rights incentivize (or hinder) technological progress, while competition law fosters (or prevents) the development of a dynamic and competitive environment that encourages ongoing innovation, market entry, and the growth of new ideas.
- Sustainable Finance and the Law (20 credits)
This course will focus on the contemporary issues arising from the market and regulatory dynamics of sustainable finance. It is tailored for students who wish to develop a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the role of sustainable finance in addressing sustainability challenges as well as the role of law in shaping sustainable finance practices.

Today, pro bono refers to a very broad range of legal work that is performed voluntarily and free of charge for the benefit of society.
Pro bono work is not a replacement for a properly funded legal aid system, but is a complementary service for those who may fall outside the legal aid system without funds to pay for legal help.
By doing pro bono work, lawyers and students alike not only give something back to the community, but develop their legal skills and knowledge about various areas of the law. Pro bono work provided can range from drafting letters to representation at court.
As students, it is crucial for us to recognize this gap in the legal system and take steps to contribute to pro bono activities, for example by aiding lawyers and organizations engaged in pro bono work. Our small steps, together, may make a world of a difference for many in society.
The purpose of this page is to provide information for LSE students interested in taking part in pro bono activities during their studies. It explains who to contact if you are an LSE student and would like to find out more information about pro bono. It also outlines some of the pro bono activities that LSE students have been involved in and have set up themselves in previous years.
There are a number of ongoing pro bono projects which LSE Law School students are, or have been, involved in. These include the following:
LSE Legal Advice Clinic aims to improve access to justice by providing free, confidential legal advice to members of the public on a range of issues. The clinic will offer students the opportunity to gain practical, hands-on experience designed to enhance their employability.
Click here to learn more.
Pro Bono Community aims to increase the amount and quality of advice from well-trained and highly-motivated volunteers as one of the few practical ways to address the legal advice deficit created by the removal of government funding. Pro Bono Community provides specialist training aimed at equipping law students, trainees and junior lawyers with the skills and expertise to work as volunteers in law centres and advice agencies. The training scheme introduces students to the sector, client care, and recent welfare reforms, before they undertake volunteering placements of providing client-facing casework assistance. The scheme provides law students with in-depth instruction in welfare benefits law and a rare opportunity to gain exposure to law in practice.
The University of London’s Refugee Law Clinic is an innovative project providing pro bono legal advice for refugee clients. Our work provides some of the most disadvantaged communities with access to fair and equal legal representation, a basic human right which many asylum seekers in the UK struggle to find. The clinic's main legal focus is on advising and preparing ‘fresh claims for asylum,’ an area identified as underserviced in the current legal landscape. Student volunteers are trained in the relevant law and policy, as well as a range of other areas such as practical skills, ethics and professional responsibilities. They then work on cases alongside volunteer lawyers from commercial law firms, and under the direct supervision of the supervising lawyer. Students will be involved in the various aspects of preparing a fresh claim submission for appeal rights exhausted asylum seekers. The work might include research, gathering evidence and drafting submissions, as well as interviewing and taking witness statements and reviewing past decision making. Students will also be involved in managing the administration of the clinic.
Every November, law clinics worldwide unite for the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice—a global movement that empowers legal clinics to address the climate emergency. On this day, law students and professionals from around the globe commit to taking one meaningful action to combat climate change.
Each year, a new theme highlights a critical environmental issue. Past themes have included deforestation, plastics, and the right to a healthy environment. This year's focus is on water
Students in previous years have participated in impactful and creative ways, from hosting talks and exhibitions to writing thought-provoking blogs, volunteering with environmental charities, and launching social media campaigns.
School Tasking brings the law to life for young learners in primary schools, offering them a fun, interactive way to explore the legal world. Inspired by the popular TV show ""Taskmaster,"" this outreach project allows LSE Law students to lead engaging workshops for Year 5 classes. These workshops use teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving to teach essential skills in a playful, challenging environment.
Whether it’s thinking outside the box or working together under time pressure, every child gets the chance to shine through their unique strengths and talents.
The ECtHR Intervention Clinic run by Dr Martin Husovec in collaboration with an NGO, the European Information Society Institute (EISi), regularly intervenes before ECtHR in important cases involving digital liberties. It provides a unique opportunity for LSE LLM students to get involved in pending cases and suggest to the Court how to interpret the law before it makes its decision. The third party’s interventions are often cited by the Strasbourg court in its decisions. Read more about previous cases here:

The LLM in Human Rights is designed to provide you with a theoretical and practical understanding of international human rights law in its broader political context, with a particular emphasis on human rights in times of transition, including conflict situations or other political and societal movements.
You will have the opportunity to not only explore the global role of human rights and the international and domestic machinery that promotes and enforces rights, but also how academic debates connect to the practice of human rights.
The programme has a flexible structure, including some interdisciplinary options, that enables you to tailor your curriculum to best suit your individual interests and career plans, drawing from a choice of specialised courses from the Law School and the School of Social and Political Science.
Edinburgh Law School is an ideal place to study human rights. With a history at the centre of the Scottish Enlightenment, we offer a unique academic space for the learning and research of human rights, which includes the University's Global Academies in the areas of Justice, Health, Development, Food and Environment and Society. Together, the Global Academies address crucial global challenges spanning the ambit of civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights and each year offer abundant opportunities for students to explore the links between human rights and the fast-paced world around them. The School is also uniquely placed to maximise its relationships with the City of Edinburgh’s many and varied human rights and peace initiatives.
Despite what many in the press may lead the public to believe, human rights and the legal and political machinery that exist to promote and protect those rights are here to stay. Human rights language is embedded across international, regional and national legal frameworks and the LLM is designed to teach you how to use this language for the improvement of the world around you. Human rights increasingly permeates other legal fields and disciplines. Understanding the basis of these rights will inform you as to how use your education to contribute to a more sustainable social and environmental future.
Because human rights are prevalent across such a broad range of disciplines, graduates of our programme have the opportunity to find work across an unlimited field. In addition to specialising in human rights law as practitioners, past students have gone on to work for human rights courts, the diplomatic service, as policy analysts and researchers in the government or in civil society and advocacy organisations, to name but a few of the career paths that have been followed after completing the LLM in Human Rights.
As a leading research institution, those teaching on the human rights programme make a point of bringing their research insights into the classroom.
Whether exploring transitional justice negotiations, deliberating the role of human rights in constitution building, addressing fair trial issues in Guantánamo, teasing out the role of women in security strategies or understanding how national governments prioritise rights through law and policy, academic staff are eager to engage students in their projects. This not only provides real, practical insight into the theory of human rights, but animates the debates about human rights in our seminars.
Additionally, each week you will have the opportunity to attend multiple extracurricular events, adding a further layer of depth to the basic course offerings.
Edinburgh plays host to a wide-ranging schedule of academic and research events throughout the year. You will be able to subscribe to mailing lists in line with your preferences. Rarely does a day pass where there are no extra-curricular events taking place.
In addition to Edinburgh academics often speaking at research related seminars, academic visitors abound in Edinburgh. Through the variety of research centres, particularly the Edinburgh Centre for International and Global Law and the Global Justice Academy, students are able to tailor an extracurricular calendar that meets all lines of theoretical, legal and interdisciplinary approaches to human rights. Furthermore, across the year we invite experts into the classroom to cover specific human rights issues in depth.

Courses listed below are scheduled for the 2025-26 academic year.
Depending on demand, space on specific courses may be limited.
You must take this course:
International Human Rights Law (20 credits, must be taken in semester 1)
This course will focus on the international law of human Rights, primarily through looking at the U.N. system including Charter and Treaty bodies as well as looking at the links between International human rights law and other related fields such as International Humanitarian law and International Criminal law.
You can select between 60 and 100 credits of the following courses:
- Fundamental Issues in International Law (40 credits)
This is a course aimed at introducing students to fundamental debates about the nature of international law and the international legal order today, and its relationship to states, markets, conflict, justice and human rights. The course is historical, conceptual, theoretical and legal. It introduces students to key ideas and arguments about where the international legal order is coming from and where it is going, what its building blocks are, and how those components are changing. A theme uniting the course is the extent to which the international legal order is shifting from a classical jus inter gentes to something else: a law of global governance, a global administrative law, a law of rights and regulation, or some combination.
- Inter-state Conflict and Humanitarian Law (20 credits)
The course will comprise the study of conflict in international law. It will be concerned with the law relating to the resort to armed force by states. The law relating to self-defence will be studied. There will also be a focus on humanitarian law, in particular, on the law relating to entitlement to combatant status, on the law regulating the conduct of hostilities between opposing forces and the law on the protection of civilians in armed conflict. In addition, there will be a study of post-conflict issues.
- Human Rights and Conflict Resolution (20 credits)
This course will examine the role of human rights in intra-state conflict and in peace processes. In particular it will examine how peace processes and agreements deal with power-sharing arrangements, transitional justice mechanisms, gender equality, and return of refugees. The course will examine the moral, political and practical dilemmas in dealing with these issues, and consider the extent to which human rights law provides useful guidance and requirements, or hinders conflict resolution efforts. The course will also touch on the overlapping requirements of international humanitarian law and international criminal law.
- Human Rights Clinic (20 credits)
The objective of the course is to enable you, primarily through research, discussion, writing and presentation in a practical setting, to acquire a thorough knowledge of advanced human rights protection at the national and international level. Through a strong link to professional human rights practice it will develop your capacity to critically analyse how the human rights system works and the demands that it places upon the various actors, including civil society, government, legislatures and stakeholders. It builds upon the foundations delivered in International Human Rights Law.
- Current Issues in the Case Law of the European Court of Human Rights (20 credits)
This course will look at a number of recent high profile decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in the context of ongoing debates on the role, functions and limits of the Strasbourg court's jurisdiction and of the European Convention on Human Rights system more generally.
- Child Law in Comparative Perspectives (20 credits)
This course aims to explore the legal status of children in Scots law, the law in other jurisdictions within the UK and the United States, Australia and New Zealand. Students from other jurisdictions will be encouraged and invited to share research findings from their home countries.
- Citizenship in Europe (20 credits)
The aim of this course is to explore the multi-level governance framework for citizenship in Europe, looking at the national, sub-national and international/European levels at which law operates. The aim is to understand the classic notion of national citizenship in the context of developments such as European Union citizenship and the impact of supranational and international norms such as the ECHR, placing the law throughout in its wider political context.
- EU Immigration and Asylum Law (20 credits)
The course is aimed to provide the students with the foundations of EU Immigration Law. They will engage in discussion on primary and secondary sources, as well as analysis of the centrepieces of the area. Through the involvement of practitioners, they will be exposed to different approaches and address the topics from a theoretical, and practical, points of view.
- Law and Power in the Muslim World (20 credits)
This course provides a critical understanding of law's relationship to power and politics in and through the 'Muslim World'. The course introduces diverse critical perspectives that examine the role of law in constructing and challenging global legal hierarchies, particularly as they play out in relation to Muslim contexts and communities.
- LGBT Rights: A Legal Perspective (20 credits)
This course engages with the complex relationship between selected LGBT matters and the legal framework applying to them. Its basis is the treatment which minorities defined by gender identity and sexual orientation have received in human rights law, with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights being particularly important sources.
You can select between 0 and 40 credits of the following courses:

View 2025-26 programme information for the LLM in Human Rights
Having successfully completed 120 credit points of courses within the LLM, you will be ready to move onto a single piece of independent and in-depth research. The 10,000 word dissertation allows you to focus on a preferred topic from within the field of human rights, normally based on a subject you have studied in one of your courses during the programme.
You will be assigned an academic dissertation supervisor who will provide you with support and guidance while you prepare and write your dissertation.
The dissertation is a challenging but rewarding endeavour, asking you to demonstrate a comprehensive grasp of the relevant literature and an ability to engage critically with a range of sources, drawing on the skills and knowledge you have developed during the course of the programme. Students are encouraged to show originality and evidence of independent thinking, whether in terms of the material used, or the manner in which it is presented.
The dissertation is written in the summer months (April to August) after the taught courses are successfully completed.
As an alternative to the conventional dissertation, some students may have the chance to apply to complete a project-based report with an NGO, government department, political party, or other relevant business or organisation during the spring and summer.
You will undertake a research project on a human rights topic linked to the activities of your respective host. The research projects will need to be officially approved by the programme director, and you will have a relevant member of staff as a contact, in parallel with the arrangement for dissertation supervision.
Project opportunities will be made available on a competitive basis, with applications made at the start of semester two.
Placements will be competitive and candidates will be shortlisted on the basis of their marks for the previous semester, with employers making the final decision based on the student's personal statement.
You may also set up projects directly, subject to a formal process of approval by the programme conveners.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.

Dr Nora Jaber - Programme Director 2025-26
Dr Nora Jaber is a Lecturer in Law in the Globalised Muslim World, based at the School of Law and the Al-Waleed Centre for the Study of Islam in the Contemporary World.
Nora’s research intersects law, feminist theory, and political economy. Her work primarily examines the role and limitations of international law in achieving justice in non-Western contexts, with a focus on gender justice in the Arab and Islamic world. It captures and centres non-Western/non-liberal frameworks and epistemologies that are largely overlooked in Western scholarship. In 2022, Nora was awarded the Leigh Douglas Memorial Prize (BRISMES) for her doctoral research on legal activism and struggles for women’s rights in Saudi Arabia.
More broadly, Nora’s work examines the relationship between law and social justice and is interested in how law strengthens and limits political struggles for justice. In 2024, Nora co-established the ‘Juridification of Justice' research network, which brings together scholars and others whose work addresses related questions.
Nora teaches international law and global law, and convenes a course titled Law and Power in the Muslim World.

Dr McCall-Smith is a senior lecturer in Public International Law and programme director for the LLM in Human Rights. She joined the Law School on a permanent basis in 2014. She is a US qualified lawyer and holds a BA and a Juris Doctor from the University of Arkansas. She also holds an LLM and PhD from the University of Edinburgh.
She is an active researcher in international human rights law, treaty law and is interested in how different actors contribute to the development of international law, including the role of treaty bodies as generators of law. Dr McCall-Smith works alongside numerous civil society organisations and channels this practical experience into her teaching and programming on the LLM in Human Rights. She also has carried out extensive research on the issues of torture and fair trial in the US military commissions in Guantanamo and the conditions of detention, including how detention relates to the prohibition against torture.
Dr McCall-Smith’s work on treaty law focuses on reservations to and interpretation of treaties. While much of her work has focused on human rights treaties, particularly the ICCPR, ICESCR and UNCRC, her current work concerns the ways in which treaty law engenders coherence and divergence across different fields of international law.
Her current research projects include Understanding the Environmental Conditions of Detention and multiple projects focused on implementing the UNCRC Incorporation Act 2024 alongside colleagues in the Observatory of Children’s Human Rights Scotland.

Desiree studied the LLM in Human Rights in the academic year 2019-20, graduating in 2020.
I am British and Turkish-Cypriot, raised in a divided Cyprus. With first-hand experience of frozen conflict, a big draw for me in choosing the LLM in Human Rights at the Edinburgh Law School became the optional focus on conflict resolution curated by Professor Christine Bell. I was also very drawn to the possibility of a placement-based dissertation and the professional emphasis incorporated within the programme.
Throughout the year our professors took a genuine interest in our background and pursuits, seeking to incorporate these into the course structure. Seminars featured guest speakers presenting their expertise and were always interactive. I gained a renewed appetite for research and a better sense of my desired career path, in large part due to the course structure and enthusiasm of the teaching staff. The student cohort worked as a team from the get-go to overcome any challenges and make the most of the programme together.

This general LLM programme is the ideal choice for students wishing to expose themselves to diverse areas of advanced legal scholarship. We offer a very wide range of specialist courses, many taught by internationally recognised experts in their fields, and legal and industry professionals.
You will select courses from across the School’s key research and teaching fields, including:
- commercial law
- criminal law
- criminology
- EU law
- IP, media and technology law
- international law
- legal history and legal theory
- medical law
- private law
- public law
This structure ensures you can pursue a truly diverse and challenging curriculum through which you will be able to develop a broad expertise in cutting-edge legal scholarship.
This programme is made up from 120 credits of taught courses and a 60-credit dissertation on an approved topic (generally one that builds upon one of the courses that you have studied with us).
There are no compulsory courses on the general LLM that all students have to take. Instead you may choose from the diverse range of specialist courses offered within the School (subject to the availability of places or whether courses are running in a given year). However, as the General LLM qualification reflects expertise across a range of subjects, there are limits on the number of courses which can be taken from any one subject area.
You will experience a range of teaching styles on this programme and we expect you to prepare in advance by reading the required materials and reflecting on the issues to be discussed. We will assess your participation in classes.
For the dissertation, we will allocate you a supervisor, who will provide guidance and support. The purpose of the dissertation however, is to allow you to independently design and conduct an original piece of research and analysis.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.
Find out more about compulsory and optional courses
We link to the latest information available. Please note that this may be for a previous academic year and should be considered indicative.
By the end of this programme, you should have acquired a more sophisticated understanding of your chosen subjects, including the diverse functions of law in contemporary society, differing approaches to the subject and a greater familiarity with research materials and methods.
The LLM in Law is an excellent way to broaden ones knowledge across a range of areas of legal specialism, gain understanding of the synergies and principles applicable across legal disciplines and identify areas of interest for a career in legal practice or academic research.
Many recent graduates have used the programme as a platform for further study. Others who are professionally qualified are now working as:
- attorneys
- lawyers
- legal advisers and specialists
- financial analysts
- tax associates
For organisations including:
- Deloitte
- The Royal Bank of Scotland
- the Brooklyn Supreme Court
- the Supreme Court of Japan

Post Graduate Program Master of Laws in German and European Law (LL.M.)
The Faculty of Law at Heidelberg University offers students having graduated in law at a university beyond Germany the opportunity to complete a two-semester advancement course in German and European law. Students graduate with the degree of Master of Laws (LLM). The Master’s degree program is intended to be studied full-time in Heidelberg. Students become familiar with key concepts and principles of the German legal system, including international and European law. The course programme also enables students to acquire specialist knowledge in self-selected fields of law, foundational subjects, or criminology.
Structure of the LL.M. Program
The degree program consists of six modules:
Module I Compulsory Module I: Civil Law
Module II Compulsory Module II: Public Law
Module III Compulsory Module III: Seminar
Module IV Elective modules: lectures, seminars, colloquia
Module V Master's thesis
Module VI Oral Magister examination
The foundations of German civil and public law are studied intensively in modules I and II. Module III combines research and teaching. The thematic focus of the content remains open. Module IV offers a wide range of elective courses relating to fields of current law, as well as foundational subjects and criminology. Students may also choose among courses on the basis of course format, as well as different forms of examination and methods of assessment offered. Module V consists in the master's thesis, which gives students the opportunity to undertake in-depth research. It is supplemented by module VI, the oral Magister examination, which focuses on the field of law considered in the Magister thesis as well as any neighbouring fields of law. Students are permitted to commence work on the Magister thesis only after they have successfully completed modules I and II.
Admission to the LL.M. Program
Admission is granted on the basis of a formal application which must be submitted by the stated application deadline (15 July). Please note that admission is possible for the winter semester only. Candidates must meet the following criteria:
– successful completion of a degree in law at an institution beyond Germany, which can be considered equivalent to the first legal examination.
– very good German language skills. Students must successfully complete the level 3 German language test for the admission to universities (Deutsche Sprachprüfung für den Hochschulzugang – DSH), or one of the equivalents stated in the admission regulations.

Introduction
LSE Law is the UK's pre-eminent research institution for law. Our academics are the authors of influential and often path-breaking scholarship, and many have globally leading reputations. As one of UK's largest law departments, with over 70 academic members of staff, LSE Law is well known for its interdisciplinary and contextual approaches to the study of law.
Our PhD Law programme offers the opportunity to undertake advanced legal research at one of the world's best law schools. Students in our PhD programme receive excellent training, and work under the supervision of leading scholars with strong international, comparative and interdisciplinary commitments. Our doctoral students become members of a lively academic community which is at the cutting-edge of legal scholarship and which plays a major role in the education of lawyers and law teachers from around the world.
Students in our PhD programme work under the supervision of two academics. We also provide specialised training for PhD students, both through our own training course and through courses run by other units of LSE, especially the Department of Methodology and the PhD Academy. PhD students are also welcome to attend any other LSE course, subject to the approval of the lecturer.
We aim to provide our PhD students with the opportunity to gain teaching experience, and also offer the opportunity to become involved with the organisation of mooting, academic conferences, pro bono work, and our working paper series.
Entry requirements
Our normal minimum entry requirement is a completed LLM degree or other master's-level qualification, awarded with an average mark of 70% (distinction/first class honours) or equivalent. Exceptionally, we may admit students who don't meet this requirement, where there is strong, alternative evidence of your suitability for our PhD programme.
Please select your country from the dropdown list below to find out the entry requirements that apply to you.
Although we accept applications from students who haven't yet completed their LLM or equivalent degree by the application deadline, we give priority within the admissions process to students who have already obtained the required grade by this date. Strong candidates who are currently completing their LLM/other master's degree may therefore wish to defer their application until they've received the requisite grade. Offers of admission and funding that are made to applicants who are currently undertaking their LLM/other masters degree are made on a “conditional” basis, meaning that the offer cannot be confirmed until the minimum entry requirement has been achieved. Conditional offers must be confirmed by the end of July of the year of entry at the latest. This means that current master's students who won't have their final grades/transcript by the end of July (including students on the LSE LLM degree) aren't eligible to apply to the PhD programme, unless they already hold another master's degree with the requisite grade.
It must be emphasised that meeting the minimum entry requirement doesn't guarantee entry. The PhD programme is heavily over-subscribed, meaning that the large majority of applicants who meet this requirement each year don't receive a place. We select students based on a variety of factors, including past academic performance, motivation for doctoral study, the viability of the applicant’s research proposal and its anticipated contribution to legal scholarship, the availability of suitable supervisors, and the diversity of the incoming PhD cohort, including diversity of subject-areas.
Research proposal
Your application should give us a clear idea of what you want to research and why.
You should state the general area in which you wish to undertake research, and provide a detailed outline of the specific questions you intend to investigate within that field. You should indicate the ways in which your proposed study would be a significant and original contribution to knowledge. You should identify the materials you expect to need, where you expect to find them, and the methods and/or framework of analysis you propose to use. Finally, you should explain how your proposed project is a good fit with other research work done within the Law School.
More detailed information on the admissions requirements for the programme, and guidance on what is required to form a successful research proposal is available in the LSE Law PhD programme FAQs page.

Your application
Overview
We welcome applications for research programmes that complement the academic interests of our staff at LSE. For this reason, we recommend that you take a look at our staff research interests before applying.
Applicants may wish to approach potential supervisors at the Law School to gauge their availability in a particular year and/or their willingness to supervise a specific research topic. However, you aren't required to contact potential supervisors before applying, and doing so provides no advantage in the admissions process. If your application is successful, two academic members of staff will be appointed to supervise you.
We carefully consider each application and take into account all the information included on your form, such as your:
- academic achievement (including existing and pending qualifications)
- statement of academic purpose
- references
- CV
- outline research proposal
- sample of written work.
See further information on supporting documents.
You may need to provide evidence of your English language proficiency. See our English language requirements.
In most instances, we hold a brief interview with shortlisted applicants as part of the admissions process. This is typically conducted by an applicant’s potential supervisors, it takes place virtually (eg, over Zoom), and it lasts about half an hour. The purpose of the interview is to further assess both the applicant’s motivation for doctoral study and the feasibility of the proposed research project. No preparation is required for the interview, although we recommend that you look over the material that you've submitted with your application beforehand.
Please note that LSE allows part-time PhD study only under limited circumstances. If you wish to study part-time, you should mention this (and the reasons for it) in your statement of academic purpose, and discuss it at interview if you're shortlisted.
When to apply
The application deadline for this programme is 1 December 2024.
However, if you’d like to be considered for any funding opportunities, you must submit your application (and all supporting documents) by the funding deadline.
See the fees and funding section below for more details.
Candidates are responsible for ensuring that any necessary supporting materials (eg, letters of reference sent by referees on their behalf) reach the LSE in good time, and are advised to start the admissions process as early as possible as a result.
Fees and funding

GenAI is a technique in artificial intelligence in which outputs such as text, images, code, music, and video are generated by software. GenAI is potentially transformative as well as disruptive, and GenAI tools will feature in many academic and professional workplaces. Rather than seek to prohibit your use of them, we will support you in using them effectively, ethically and transparently.
However, it may not always be appropriate to use GenAI. Whilst they are attractively powerful and easy to use, GenAI tools can provide misleading or incorrect information. They can also negatively impact your learning by reducing the need for critical engagement that is key to deep and meaningful learning. Additionally, you need to be aware of the difference between reasonable use of such tools, and at what point their use might be regarded as giving you an unfair advantage.
Visit the Generative AI Hub
For more details on how GenAI works, the ethical implications and limitations of the tools and the ways in which you can use them, please visit the Generative AI Hub.
The Generative AI and Academic Skills Moodle course provides a more in-depth look at GenAI in an academic context.
GenAI and academic integrity
Academic misconduct is strictly prohibited, including the use of essay mills, homework help sites, plagiarism, collusion, falsification, impersonation or any other action which might give me an unfair advantage.
An unfair advantage is:
• when you hide something and aren't transparent about your approach.
• when you take something directly from someone (or something) else and don't reference or acknowledge it.
• when you don't follow the assessment guidance.
It is not acceptable to use GenAI tools to write your entire assessment and present this as your own work. Words and ideas from GenAI tools are making use of other human authors' ideas without referencing them, which is considered by many to be a form of plagiarism.
Using GenAI tools to check your grammar or spelling is usually appropriate if the tool is not rewriting a large proportion of your work. Similarly, tasks such as ideas generation or planning may be an appropriate use. For all assessments, your context and the nature of the assessment must be considered.
Your teachers will give guidance on:
• what ways (if at all) you are permitted to use GenAI.
• which aspects of your work it is appropriate (or even expected) that you use GenAI for.
If you are unsure about what constitutes acceptable use of GenAI in an assessment, ask for clarification from the module leader. If no explicit instructions are given, the default for assessments should be that you use GenAI in an assistive role while making sure that the final submission is still substantially your own work.
Staff resources on how to guide students on the use of GenAI in assessments can be found on the Generative AI Hub. Category 2 describes in more detail how GenAI might be used in an assistive role.
UCL does not use GenAI detectors when marking. Instead, if a marker has any concerns about your work, they may speak to you to get more information. You should not automatically assume this means that they suspect you of academic misconduct.
Inappropriate use of GenAI is viewed as plagiarism. This is defined as the representation of other people’s work or ideas as your own without appropriate referencing or acknowledgement. This includes the use of GenAI tools that exceeds that permitted in the assessment brief.
If teaching staff suspect that you are trying to pass off GenAI output as your own work then the regulations in the Academic Manual (9.2.5 a), 9.2.5 e) iii, and 9.2.6 c) may apply. You may be invited to an investigatory viva to probe the authorship of your work.
How to acknowledge GenAI use in your work
You should acknowledge GenAI use where it has been used to assist in the process of creating your work.
The Library Skills pages share guidance on how and when to acknowledge GenAI in your work.",22,75.2,UCL,11.3,86.4,41110,22,ucl.ac.uk,78.4,2073:36,88.1,97.9,United Kingdom,"policy, administrative communications",4.4286825415886995,0.4698085419734904,676,False,22

Joining a College when you become a member of the University of Cambridge makes you part of a community of world-leading scholars and researchers.
Colleges are an important base while you’re studying at Cambridge, providing support, social activities and resources.
Postgraduates have been central to Churchill College since its foundation in 1960. We support doctoral and one-year postgraduates to thrive and reach their potential within a diverse and friendly community of scholars. We have a highly international community of postgraduates, reflecting the global community of academics we attract, who make up half the student body of the College.
We are unique in having a large parkland site of 50 acres, adjacent to a number of major academic departments and research centres, and about half a mile from the historic centre of the city.
Every student of the University is a member of one of the Colleges. The Colleges are an important base while you’re studying; providing academic guidance and support, social activities, and wider resources.
As well as welfare and practical support, a wide range of facilities, and social and sports opportunities, we offer a number of funded postgraduate studentships each year. We are normally able to offer accommodation to every one-year student and to doctoral students for three or more years.
Before you apply
Applications
Offer holders
The College system
Cambridge is a ‘collegiate’ university which means it’s made up of a number of Colleges alongside the academic faculties and departments. As well as being a member of the University, all students are also members of a College.
The Colleges provide students with welfare and practical support, accommodation and catering, social and sports facilities, and access to a range of other resources. A student’s College is one of their key social and intellectual communities while they are at Cambridge.
All postgraduate applicants can indicate up to two preference Colleges on their application, or leave their preference “open” if they wish.
Churchill College was established in 1960 with a vision to invigorate and expand research and study, and from the very start we have had a strong focus on postgraduate education.
We offer a friendly, collaborative and multidisciplinary community for postgraduates with excellent facilities and student support.
Financial support
The College offers a number of funded PhD and Masters studentships each year, and we have funding available for students wishing to take on additional language learning, travelling for conferences, for sports and arts activities, and for assistance if you are in financial difficulty.
Accommodation and catering
We have about 250 units for postgraduates, including a mix of en-suites and shared bathroom accommodation, alongside a number of flats and maisonettes suitable for families and couples. We set aside rooms to offer to every first-year postgraduate student joining the College, and we normally offer accommodation to doctoral students for three years during their course.
All students have access to subsidised cafeteria-style and formal dining in the College. We are fortunate to have the largest dining hall in Cambridge which is used for everyday dining and grand community dinners. There is also a café-bar area, called the Buttery, providing sandwiches, pizzas, snacks and drinks.
Welfare and practical support
Every postgraduate student of the College is assigned an individual Tutor who is available to provide advice and guidance about navigating your time in Cambridge and where to get help if you need it. The Postgraduate Office is near the main entrance to the College. It is open 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday to Friday to provide guidance on anything related to your studies or life in Cambridge.
At Churchill College, we also have a College Nurse and a Wellbeing Co-ordinator on-site and available should you need them. Your individual Tutor or the Finance Tutor can also provide advice on financial assistance.
Libraries and resources
There are over a hundred libraries in Cambridge, including the central University Library which is a research library of international significance providing access to more than 9 million individual items – about 1500 metres from the College.
The College has three libraries on site: the Bevin library for Sciences, the Bracken Library for Arts and Humanities, plus the Roskill Library in the Churchill Archives Centre for political and social history. The Churchill Archives Centre is a rich source of items documenting British domestic politics and international relations, advanced scientific knowledge, and society, economics and culture of the 20th century.
Facilities
As a campus-based site, Churchill College is fortunate to be able to bring all its facilities into one place.
- Sport and fitness: sports fields, basketball courts, tennis courts, squash courts, dance studios, and gym (free for student use).
- Arts: Music Centre featuring recording studio and recital room, art studio, theatre
- Students also organise visiting yoga classes, film screenings, open mic nights, and a range of other activities enabled by the College’s facilities.
- MCR: a dedicated space for postgraduates, including the Vicious Penguin, the MCR-run bar.
An active social community
There are around 475 undergraduate students and 350 postgraduate students at Churchill College, which provides a cross-disciplinary community, and an active social and academic event schedule. The postgraduate student body is represented by the Churchill College MCR (Middle Common Room), who advocate for postgraduates as well as running a varied programme of events, from punting trips to academic conferences.
Our multi-disciplinary pedigree
Churchill College has always been focused on the benefits of bringing people together to spark ideas and interdisciplinary working.
We were established with a focus on bringing Science and Technology together with creativity and innovation. That core purpose continues to the present day, extending into Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.
The College is a friendly, collaborative, and multidisciplinary community for postgraduates, with around 350 postgraduates representing all six academic schools at Cambridge.
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics are in many respects the axis of the College’s academic community, and more than half of our students join the College in STEM subjects.
Over time, many of the University’s key STEM departments have located themselves adjacent to the College: the University’s West Cambridge Science and Technology Campus, the Centre for Mathematical Sciences, the Cavendish Laboratory, the Institute of Astronomy, and many others are very close to the College.
While STEM students have access to some of the finest equipment and laboratories available in their departments, the Bill Brown Creative Workshop and the Engineering Shed in College capture the spirit of imagination, curiosity and creativity characteristic of our STEM students and seniors.
Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences
Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences are essential to the depth and complexity of the College’s academic community, and we reserve about a third of our postgraduate places for students in HASS subjects.
The College is especially well placed for the libraries and resources of the University’s Sidgwick Site, a campus of departments in the Schools of Arts and Humanities and of Humanities and Social Sciences, which is under a mile away.
The University Library, one of the six “legal deposit” libraries in the UK entitled to a copy of all published material, with more than 8 million books and access to a vast resource of digital materials, is even nearer than that.
The College’s own on-site library, is made up of three constituents: the Bracken Library for Science and Social Science collections, the Bevin Library for Arts and Humanities collections, and the Roskill Library for political, military and scientific history.
The College is also home to the Churchill Archives Centre, a unique collection of the papers of Winston Churchill and the personal papers of many of the most influential figures in modern British politics, society and science.
Medical, Psychological and Veterinary Studies
Medical, Psychological and Veterinary Studies normally account for around a quarter of the College’s postgraduate students, including about ten students a year who join the postgraduate community for their clinical studies after three years of pre-clinical studies as an undergraduate.
Research students in Medical and Psychological Studies work across the University’s world-leading laboratories and units, including the Sanger Institute, the Medical Research Council centres, the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, and others. Many of these centres are based on the West Cambridge Site, which is adjacent to the College site, and the College has postgraduate accommodation available near the Addenbrookes Biomedical Campus.
Campus life
Churchill offers a campus experience, with lots of on-site features.
Our community includes around 900 students, 175 staff and 260 Fellows, making for a vibrant and diverse place to live and work.
The fact that our key facilities are all on-campus supports Churchill’s unique sense of community. Our students work, eat, and thrive together.
Our location
Churchill provides the best of both worlds. Situated beside a number of major academic departments and research centres, we are in easy reach of the centre city yet benefit from a peaceful environment.
The College is on the ‘Universal’ bus route providing a regular, subsidised and sustainable (fully electric) bus service to almost every part of the University.
Churchill College has a large, unified campus with trees, gardens and sports fields. The site includes the original purpose-built centre of the College where central facilities are located such as libraries, seminar rooms and a lecture theatre. We also have a café-bar and a dining hall within the heart of the College.
Our lively College boat club shares a modern boathouse with two other Colleges and we are the nearest College to the University Sports Centre. We have sports fields, squash courts and a gym, as well as a dance studio and a music centre with a recording studio and recital spaces on site.
Accommodation provision
Most of our dedicated postgraduate accommodation is located on our main site. We have various types of rooms and flats including ensuites, studios, maisonettes, and rooms in houses with shared facilities.
The College has some of the best provision for students with children and partners in the University, with 45 flats and maisonettes with a children’s play area.
We have 6 off-site houses; 4 in the nearby area, 1 near the city centre, and 1 near the Addenbrookes Cambridge Biomedical Campus (which can be especially convenient for those studying or working there). While you are not required to live on-site, the College has have some excellent options when looking for postgraduate accommodation at Cambridge University.
We aim to offer accommodation to all first-year students who require it, and normally offer a room to incoming students who request accommodation and meet the conditions of their offer by 1st September – though this depends on availability and getting your preferred room cannot always be guaranteed.
Please see our Postgraduate Accommodation page for a more detailed information about they types of postgraduate accommodation available at Churchill.
The MCR: representing postgraduates
The Middle Common Room (MCR) is a student body that exists to support the graduate student community of Churchill College. MCR organise academic and recreational events throughout the year to encourage bonding between students and to enrich their lives.
The MCR committee is elected annually and is made up of 20 officers, each with specific roles. The Committee plans Freshers’ Week, Guest Nights, the Christmas Party, and other social events. It organises academic seminars and the Conference on Everything; runs the MCR Bar, and represents the views of the MCR to College through various sub-committees.
The Committee meets once a fortnight during term. Open meetings are held at least once a term and all Churchill College postgraduates are welcome to attend.
Clubs and societies
Churchill College’s student body organise and run over 20 different clubs and societies. Whether you are interested in guest talks, sports or board games, there will be something to appeal to you.
In addition, Churchill College’s grounds often host other University clubs and societies, such as the Space Flight society and Drone club, due to the suitability of our grounds for activities.
Special activities for postgraduates with families also run across the year.
Funding and finances
Postgraduate applicants to Churchill College are able to apply for a range of funding opportunities.
Each year, we expect to offer a number of funded PhD and Master’s studentships across subject areas and disciplines. See our studentships page for more information.
In addition, a significant number of students secure funding from national and international research bodies and other sources. You can find out more about the studentships we offer on the College’s financial support finder and on the University’s funding portal.
Finances and costs
The fees and costs of studying at Cambridge are normally broken down into expenses incurred for everyday living and studying (normally called “maintenance”) and the direct fees required by the University (primarily, the “University Composition Fee”).
One of the conditions you will have to fulfil before coming to Cambridge is a “financial condition” set by the University. You will need to confirm to the University’s Postgraduate Admissions Office that you have financial resources to cover fees and maintenance (including living costs of any dependents) while you are at Cambridge.
When you are here you can access some College and University financial support; this might include funding to support travel when you are presenting at conferences, funding for sports or music activities, as well as language learning. We also have some emergency funds which can help when unforeseen difficulties arise.
The University provides a guideline to average, basic maintenance costs in the finance section of its website. You should take care to consider your personal situation and individual additional costs when you are considering your maintenance arrangements.
The University Composition Fee covers the cost of teaching and supervision, and access to University and College facilities and support services. It is collected through the College and the total fee varies by course; this is adjusted for students taking courses part-time. There is a look-up for all courses and fees on the University website with wider information about the fees and costs of studying at Cambridge.
Self-funded students are required to pay for the academic year at least 14-days before arriving in Cambridge, and those who are funded by external organisations should provide a letter from the funder confirming the arrangement and details as soon as that is available.
Travel and other funds
The College recognizes the importance of engaging with wider communities of students and scholars in your field; in addition to the studentships we offer, all postgraduate students are eligible to apply for financial support to travel to conferences where they are presenting their work.
In addition, we have postgraduate funding opportunities for those who need help to fund sports at University or national level. We also provide music bursaries to pursue private instrumental or vocal lessons and for costs associated with practising and performing. The College can provide half the cost of fees for a course at the University Language Centre under the Cambridge University Languages Programme (CULP).
Emergency support
Prior to starting their course, all postgraduate students are expected to have arranged sufficient funding for the duration of their studies. This is part of the financial condition for entry that is set by the University. However, if a student encounters unforeseen financial difficulties, they can apply for additional support or an emergency loan. Students may also be eligible to apply to the central University for support in these circumstances.
The application process
We know it can be a complex process, but we are here to help.
In order to be considered by Churchill College, you should list us as your first preference College. If you are made an offer of study by the University, your application will be sent to one or more Colleges to be considered for College membership. If we are able to offer you a place, we will write to you with more information and ask you to fill out and return our membership form.
The confirmation of a place at the College and the University depends on meeting the conditions set by the University. The University publishes a guide to your offer and its conditions each year to help explain this part of the process.
We hold regular online Q&A’s for Churchill College offer-holders, and the College’s Postgraduate Office is here to help guide you through the process.
Please contact the College’s Postgraduate Office if you have any queries: postgrad.admissions@
PhD / Doctoral research
Churchill College has been supporting doctoral students since its foundation.
When you join the College as a research student, you join a community of around 350 postgraduates, about two-thirds of whom are working towards doctoral degrees, and more than 200 senior academics.
In the postgraduate community of the College, around half the students are in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects, and the other half are balanced between Medical, Veterinary and Psychological Studies, and Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS). A significant proportion of our members work in ways that overlap domains and disciplines, and we encourage formal and informal interaction and collaboration across boundaries.
One of the distinctive benefits of the College system is that after a long day in your department, you can return to a relaxed community where you spend time with friends and colleagues working in completely different ways who understand the world and their research subject on different terms. It is not only a refreshing change, but it can spark and foster new ideas and new creative thinking.
We welcome applications from students who can contribute to a friendly, mixed community of creative and thoughtful scholars with the capacity for positive impact.
Undertaking PhD / Doctoral research at Cambridge University is intellectually demanding, requires a high level of attainment and motivation, and is personally and academically rewarding. We want to make sure every student has the opportunity to perform at their best, and to overcome the ups and downs that can occur during any long-term research project.
Every student undertaking PhD / Doctoral research at Cambridge as a member of Churchill College is assigned an individual tutor, an experienced Cambridge academic and senior member of the College, who can provide guidance and support, and every student has access to excellent wellbeing help and provision alongside the full range of facilities of the College and the wider University.
MPhil / Masters study
Admission to the College for postgraduate study and research is based on academic excellence and the potential to achieve at the highest levels.
We are looking for students who can contribute to a mixed community of creative and thoughtful scholars with the capacity for positive impact.
There are several forms of Masters study in hundreds of subject areas available in Cambridge, most of which are available as a one-year full-time course, and some can be taken with a two-year part-time study pattern.
MPhil degrees are either by Advanced Study, which includes a taught element, or by Dissertation, which is a research-only programme examined by dissertation.
The MRes (Master of Research) degree is preparatory to potential PhD Doctoral study in a specific area. It offers a mixed programme of projects, seminars, lectures and training with a view to starting Doctoral study after one year.
In addition to the MPhil and the MRes, the University offers a wide range of Masters courses in distinct subject areas, for example the MBA (Master of Business Administration), MFin (Master of Finance), LLM (Master of Law), and a range of other subjects. These include the MASt (Master of Advanced Study) which is equivalent to a further year of undergraduate study having met the Bachelor’s requirement or equivalent, and the MSt (Master of Studies) which is normally completed part-time and often oriented to professional and academic attainment for career progression, diversification and personal development.
Every programme of study can have it’s ups and downs, and we want to help every student succeed at every stage of their studies. As a member of Churchill College, each MPhil and Master’s student is assigned an individual tutor, an experienced Cambridge academic and senior member of the College, who can provide guidance and support. Every student has access to excellent wellbeing help and provision alongside the full range of facilities of the College and the wider University.
We are proud of the College’s friendly community of academically excellent scholars, at undergraduate, postgraduate and senior level, and we welcome interest from innovative and creative applicants looking for a distinctive and multidisciplinary home during their time in Cambridge.

Welcome to the sites of the Heidelberg Center for Digital Humanities!
Working with digital data and thus the changes in thinking and research in the humanities is a now constant part of the Digital Humanities. Clearly defining and framing it alone is a major challenge due to its highly dynamic nature. The HCDH makes its contribution by providing sustainable support along the key areas of Digital Heritage and Digital Linguistics as well as related research areas and topics together with the service partners in the field. In addition, the aspect of digitality as an overarching theme represents a core topic in the engagement with the Digital Humanities at HCDH. The center strives for far-reaching networking, designs joint events and offers funding measures for innovative projects. On the one hand, this enables the best possible advancement of research in the focus topics and, on the other hand, to consolidate the basic competencies in the DH in Heidelberg.
After the HCDH was founded at the end of 2022 from the initiative of the Research Council of the Field of Focus 3 and the resulting ""Heidelberg Forum Digital Humanities (HFDH), it has by now grown into an established hub for applicational and methodological advice, teachings and training opportunities in the areas of research, teaching and service. Regarding the dynamic developments in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs), the HCDH has launched the pilot project ParzivAI to expand competencies in the computational humanities. In order to become and remain connected with the dynamic field, the HCDH plans to produce an open source research output from 2025 onwards. To do so, it has, for example, set up the CAEDHET research group in collaboration with the Heidelberg School of Education and the Heidelberg University of Education, which will develop LLM-based tools for the humanities and design them in an application-oriented manner.
The HCDH is managed by a board of directors representing the areas of Digital Heritage, Digital Linguistics and AI/Machine Learning. It offers a range of services and aims to support research members in shaping strategies for new developments in DH.
Members of the university may apply for membership in the center at any time by contacting the board of directors. All applications for funding from the Excellence Strategy for Digital Humanities projects will also be directed to the scientific director of the HCDH. A central criterion of incoming applications should be the aspects of interdisciplinarity and sustainability in the field of data management and implementation as a best practice example for future projects. Thematically, the topics of Digital Heritage and Digital Linguistics are particularly encouraged. Applications with the overarching theme of 'Digitality' are also possible.

Our ambition is to push the frontiers of electronics through emerging technologies, disrupting current ways of thinking by innovating advanced nano/biosensors, safe and efficient energy storage solutions and novel hardware for AI. We are offering prospective PhD students the opportunity to join our team, interested in devoting their passion for addressing some of the challenges we have identified. This project will also be supervised by Dr Cristian Sestito.
The project aims at building accelerators based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and suitable to deliver computer vision tasks through Generative AI. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are promising candidates in this direction: they exploit adversarial learning and feature extraction to execute a multitude of applications, including image dataset generation, image-to-image translation, face frontalisation. Specifically, the project targets deploying applications like this on FPGA-based Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) to be showcased in real-time systems, with an in-depth investigation on optimisation techniques to reach high throughput and low energy footprint (e.g., data quantisation and pruning). This will require preliminary training using software frameworks, like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
The required skills are as follows:
- Knowledge and expertise on FPGA design for AI using Verilog/VHDL (mandatory).
- Knowledge and expertise on training and testing CNNs using SW frameworks, like PyTorch or TensorFlow (mandatory).
- Basic knowledge on Systems-on-Chip based on FPGAs (desirable).
- Previous experience on using 3rd party IP cores for vision applications (desirable).
- Previous experience on training generative AI models (desirable).

Prof. Jenny Gibson is Professor of Neurodiversity and Developmental Psychology at the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge. Jenny leads the Play and Communication Lab research group. She is also a co-director of PEDAL the centre for research on Play in Education, Development and Learning, and a co-director of CHIA, the Centre for Human-Inspired Artificial Intelligence.
Jenny has long been fascinated by the connections between linguistic and social aspects of child development. Most of her research investigates this link, usually with neurodivergence, play and mental health as key topics. Jenny is also a qualified speech and language therapist, specialising in autism and developmental language disorder.
Research
The PacLab team investigates human development, flourishing and neurodiversity. We also conduct research about specific neurodivergent groups, specialising in autism and developmental language disorder. Our work is rooted in developmental psychology and we have many interdisciplinary influences including; disability studies, linguistics, computer science, psychiatry, literary studies and education.
Play is a major research focus in the PacLab group. We are investigating how this ubiquitous, yet often-overlooked, aspect of human experience is linked to mental health, wellbeing, social development and linguistic development. We are especially interested in over-turning deficit focused narratives concerning neurodivergence and play.
Participatory research is a guiding value in our team. We aim to include and amplify the voices and perspectives of under-represented groups.
Networks and Projects
Prospective PhD Applications - open for 2025 entry
I aim to admit 2 PhD students to join the Play and communication Lab research group in October 2025. I will consider applications from candidates who wish to conduct research that aligns with a neurodiversity-affirming ethos. I will prioritise applicants who can demonstrate how their proposed research topic fits with and builds upon the research from my group. Please visit the PacLab website to learn more about what we are working on. I will prioritise applications that align with following topics and methods:
- Autism
- Developmental Language Disorder
- Neurodiversity, especially in the early years
- Play in neurodivergent populations
- AI or data analytics applied to diagnosis, education, wellbeing or support for neurodivergent individuals
Applicants please note that most of our research is carried out from a developmental psychology perspective and previous study of psychology, while not essential, is likely to be an advantage.
I welcome applications from potential students with lived experience of neurodivergence.
Interested applicants should contact me by email in September/October 2024 with an outline proposal of no more than one page. I will offer feedback, and if there is a potentially strong fit with my research group and priorities I may arrange a conversation to discuss your research ideas further.

Overview
Intellectual property is at the core of all modern economies. Digital technologies are shaped by rights of creators and inventors, and the licensing practices that have evolved around these rights. Thus, understanding what intellectual property rights protect is indispensable to understand the world around us.
How do content creators get paid? Does YouTube have to pay all its users? How do companies build their brands? Can they trademark colours? How do inventors secure rights over their inventions? Are patents always good indicators of quality?
All these questions shape cultural, scientific and business interactions in today’s modern economy. Thus, regardless of the industry, understanding the key principles and challenges of IP is essential. This course introduces the intellectual property law system and its role in forming the building blocks of the modern economy.

Travel & Research Grants assist students with the costs of conducting research and/or presenting it at conferences. They are awarded on a competitive basis. Students who have been unsuccessful in a previous application are encouraged to apply again. Roughly 70 awards are available each year.
- What do the grants cover?
Travel & Research Grants might support:
- Travel, accommodation and /or registration fees to present a paper or a poster at an academic conference or to chair a session.
- Awards of up to £150 to cover the costs of attending a conference that is directly relevant to the student’s research interests, but at which the student is neither making a presentation nor chairing a session.
- Travel and accommodation necessary for archival work, data collection, fieldwork or periods of necessary research.
- Cover costs for medical students undertaking a medical elective placement.
- Costs to learn or improve language skills in order to sit mandatory exams, read essential literature or conduct interviews that are directly related to the student’s research.
Travel & Research Grants will not ordinarily support:
- Computer hardware, software licenses, purchase of books, reagents, research services provided by a third party, including the recruitment of participants.
- General interest language courses or courses in academic English, meals and other incidental costs while traveling for research.
- Expenses that could be covered by other sources, e.g. departmental or Faculty fieldwork budgets, doctoral training funds linked with particular studentship awards, etc.
- Associated costs of third parties (relatives, partners, etc) attending the same event.
- How much is available?
Undergraduates may apply for up to £400 in each year of full-time study. Students on one or two-year postgraduate courses (e.g. MPhil, LLM, MMus, MEd, MSt) may receive up to £400 in total during their course.
PhD students may receive up to £1200 in total during the first three years of their course. They may choose to apply for multiple awards or to use the entire amount to fund an extended period or research or an international conference presentation.
Applications are not ordinarily accepted from PhD students who are no longer paying the University composition fee (e.g. after the 3rd year of full-time study or the 6th year of part-time study). No awards will be made to students who have already submitted the dissertation for examination.
Finally, the College can cover up to £500 of costs for students undertaking medical elective placements. Please be aware that when processing the reimbursement for costs incurred the College can only cover the costs not already covered by NHS funding, for example, a TDAE (Travel and Dual Accommodation Expenses) application.
- Who is eligible to apply?
Both undergraduate and postgraduate students may apply for Travel and Research grants. No grants will be awarded to students for activities to be undertaken after graduation or, in the case of doctoral students, after the submission of their thesis.
Travel & Research grants are intended to support subject-specific research that is essential to the student's course (e.g. compulsory trips or study tours). Projects that are not directly related to a student’s research may instead be funded from the Wolfson College Vacation Project Grants.
- What are the deadlines?
Deadlines for applications and references for Travel & Research Grants can be found on the Financial Support page.
Only students who will still be enrolled as a student at Wolfson College in the subsequent academic year are eligible for travel & research funding over the Long Vacation (June-September).
It is the student's responsibility to get the references submitted five days before the Student Finance Committee meets. Any incomplete applications will not be considered.
The Committee will not normally consider retroactive applications. The activity for which you are applying for funding should take place within the current academic year, i.e. from 1 October 2024 to 30 September 2025. Applications for travel outside this period will be considered if the applicant provides clear justification.
- How to apply
Please complete the Travel & Research Grant online application form and ensure that your Tutor and Director of Studies (for undergrads) or your Tutor and Supervisor (for postgrads) submit the required online reference; all before the deadlines stipulated in the section above.
As college funds available for travel & research grants are limited, the Student Finance Committee allows only one application per round to ensure the distribution of funds is equitable. The Student Finance Committee will consider applications for multi-destination travel within the same application where students can make a case this is cost effective, i.e., in order to attend two different conferences in the same country.
In the application form you must:
- Provide a complete, realistic budget and evidence of projected expenses (i.e., quotes for travel and accommodation costs). It is assumed that the cheapest available transport and accommodation will be chosen. Grants will not cover the cost of food, drink or incidentals.
- Indicate what other support is available or already secured (from your department/faculty, funding agency or other source) to cover your costs.
- Indicate how you will cover any costs that available and/or anticipated funding cannot meet.
- Explain why it is important and necessary to attend this conference or conduct this research and how it fits into your studies.
- Indicate that you have discussed your plans with your Tutor and Director of Studies (for undergrads) or your Tutor and Supervisor (for postgrads) and they will be sent the reference link once you have completed the form.
- It is a mandatory requirement to submit a risk assessment with your application if you are travelling outside the UK. Any applications without the appropriate risk assessment will not be considered. If you are travelling within the UK you should upload a PDF statement stating why your application does not require a risk assessment.
- IMPORTANT: Once you have received a response from the Committee on your award, please use this link to upload your documents (PDF format only). Please note that you must upload your documents within 12 months of receiving the outcome of your application, or before you complete your course as stipulated on Camsis (whichever comes first). Failure to provide these documents may results in the award being withdrawn.
Vacation Project Grants
Vacation Project Grants support activities that are broadly educational, but that do not qualify for a Travel & Research Grant. They are awarded on a competitive basis. Students who have been unsuccessful in a previous application are encouraged to apply again. Up to 10 awards are available each year.
- What do the grants cover?
Vacation Project Grants may support:
- Volunteer work for charities or non-profit community organisations
- Unpaid or low-paid internships or laboratory research
- Unpaid or low-paid projects in the arts (e.g. summer theatre)
- Any project with a meaningful charitable, cultural or broadly educational purpose (e.g. participating in an archaeological dig, presenting a play at the Edinburgh Fringe)
Vacation Project Grants will not support:
- Holidays
- General-interest travel
- How much is available?
A student may receive up to a total of £400 for vacation projects during the course of their studies at Wolfson.
Students may apply for the full amount to fund a single project or apply for smaller amounts to fund several projects during their course of study; as funds are limited, however, first-time applicants may be given priority over those who are applying for funding to support a second project.
Vacation Project Grants will cover no more than 50% of the costs of any project; the student is responsible for raising the remainder from other sources.
- Who is eligible to apply?
All undergraduate and postgraduate students may apply for Vacation Project grants to fund activities during termly vacations.
PhD students may also apply for a Vacation Project Grant during any period of annual leave agreed with their supervisor. Students on one-year courses (e.g. MPhil or LLM) are only eligible to apply for Vacation Project Grants to cover activities during the Christmas or Easter vacations.
No grants will be awarded to students for activities to be undertaken after graduation or, in the case of postgraduate students, after the submission of their thesis.
- What are the deadlines?
Deadlines for applications and references for Vacation Project Grants can be found on the Financial Support page.
Only students who will still be enrolled as a student at Wolfson College in the subsequent academic year are eligible for Vacation Project Grants over the Long Vacation (June-September).

This should be mentioned in the assessment task. If not, then ask your Course Organiser.
Some assessments may explicitly ask you to work with AI tools and to analyse and critique the content it generates. Other assessments may specify, for good reason, that AI tools should not be used in particular ways.
Please also make sure that you follow the University’s Guidance on Proofreading of Students Assessments when using GenAI for proofreading, editing and/or translation.
You will never be asked to pay to use external GenAI tools.
Some of the positive, and generally acceptable, ways GenAI might be used include:
- Brainstorming ideas through prompts
- Getting explanations of difficult ideas, questions and concepts
- Self-tutoring through conversation with the GenAI tool
- Creating practice questions and self-tests
- Organising and summarising your notes
- Planning and structuring your writing
- Summarising a text, article or book
(Check first that the copyright owner permits use of GenAI for this purpose)
- Helping to improve your grammar, spelling, and writing
(Check for restrictions where use of language is specified as an integral part of the assessment).
- Translation of texts in other languages
(Check for restrictions where translation is the purpose of an assessment)
- Overcoming writer’s block through dialogue with the GenAI tool
- Help with writing, de-bugging code and logical reasoning
(check for restrictions where this is a core skill to be demonstrated in an assessment)
How to use ELM with prompts
Will I be penalised for using GenAI in my assessed work?
You will not be penalised for using GenAI, as long as you are working within the acceptable uses of GenAI outlined, and you are adhering to any other restrictions that have been specified for a particular assessment.
Please bear in mind, though, that use of GenAI carries a number of risks and limitations (outlined below) that could impact the quality of your work and, ultimately, the grade you may receive. While you may use GenAI to aid your learning, you may be required (e.g. in an exam or other assessment) to demonstrate your abilities without the aid of such tools.
Citing and acknowledging the use of GenAI
Where GenAI is used, it is important to be transparent about how you have used it and what content has been generated from it.
You should acknowledge all use of generative AI tools to help with any aspect of planning, writing or creating your assignment. Your acknowledgement should include:
- Name and version (if included) of the GenAI system used; e.g. ELM; ChatGPT-3.5
- Publisher (the company that made the GenAI system); e.g. University of Edinburgh, EDINA; OpenAI
- URL of the GenAI system (for example ELM and ChatGPT)
- Brief description (single sentence) of context in which the tool was used.
Example of citing your use of GenAI
ELM (University of Edinburgh, EDINA) was used to suggest a structure for the report and to suggest improvements to the grammar and spelling of the finished report.
Check your assessment guidelines or check with your lecturer/supervisor about where the acknowledgment needs to be within your assignment.
If you use content generated by an AI tool within your work, for example, an AI-generated image or text from an AI chatbot, you will need to reference it in a similar way to referencing other information sources. This means including an in-text citation or footnote in the body of your work and a corresponding reference in a reference list or bibliography. The Library’s guide to using generative AI tools in academic work provides information on how to reference AI tools in a variety of referencing styles.
Further requirements regarding acknowledging the use of GenAI may be stipulated for particular assessments. These should be made clear in assessment tasks. If you are unsure, please check with Course Organisers/Lecturers. You may be asked to include the following additional information in an appendix:
- The prompts used to generate material from a GenAI tool
- The date the output was generated
- The output obtained/or an extract of the output obtained
- How the output was used, edited or incorporated into a piece of work (e.g. in the case of proof-reading by including a tracked-changes document).
Risks of over-reliance on GenAI
While fully AI-generated outputs can seem impressive on the surface, they can often contain factual errors, lack nuance, critical engagement, and depth of expression and understanding.
Importantly, overreliance on AI tools simply to generate written content, software code or analysis reduces your opportunity to develop and practice key skills (e.g. writing, critical thinking, evaluation, analysis, coding, reasoning). These are all important aspects of your learning at university and will continue to be required in your working life.
Written work is a key way of demonstrating critical thinking and deep engagement with your course material, much of which happens during the process of writing. Relying on AI-generated output will prevent you from developing the skills you acquire when you are doing it yourself. A vital aspect of your learning at university is about developing these advanced skills, learning how to think and build an argument through writing. GenAI is no substitute for this.
While GenAI can be useful for some tasks, it is essential that you are aware of its many limitations that include the following:
- GenAI tools are language machines rather than databases of knowledge – they work by predicting the next plausible word, image, or snippet of programming code from patterns that have been ‘learnt’ from large data sets.
- They have no understanding of what they generate.
- The datasets that such tools are learning from are flawed and contain inaccuracies, biases, and limitations.
- They generate text that is not always factually correct. A knowledgeable human must check the output.
- GenAI can create software/code that has security flaws and bugs. Often the code or calculation produced by AI will look plausible but contains errors in detailed working on closer inspection. A human trained in that programming language should fully check any code or calculation produced in this way.
- The data GenAI models are trained on are not necessarily up-to-date – they may have limited or constrained data on the world after a certain point.
- They can occasionally produce fake citations and references.
- Such systems are amoral – they do not know that it is wrong to generate offensive, inaccurate or misleading content, and sometimes do so.
- They include hidden plagiarism – meaning that they make use of words and ideas from human authors without referencing them.
- GenAI may use illegal libraries and material generated from AI may infringe copyright or intellectual property.
GenAI and academic misconduct
GenAI can be a valuable learning aid, but should never be used as a substitute for your own assessed work.
All work submitted for assessment should be your own original work. Some assessments may require you to sign a declaration to state this – please check with your Course Organiser on this point.
It is not acceptable to present AI-generated content as your own work. If you do, this will be regarded as academic misconduct.
Academic misconduct is defined by the University as:",30,71.1,University of Edinburgh,11.5,77.5,33940,30,ed.ac.uk,70.7,1860:00,82.5,97.0,United Kingdom,"policy, administrative communications",4.4814514380758395,0.4361158432708688,1216,False,30

Central to this programme are how closely the core courses are integrated: these have been carefully designed by academics in both departments to ensure students can review common situations in companies from both a legal and financial perspective, and ensure a holistic understanding of how corporations raise capital and complete transactions.
Access to a range of courses, both from the Department of Finance and the LLM programme, will enable you to complement the core Law and Finance modules with a wide range of specialised legal and financial courses, adding additional depth to your knowledge in your chosen specialist areas.

Competition for places at LSE is strong. So, even if you meet the minimum entry requirements, this does not guarantee you an offer of a place.
However, please don’t feel deterred from applying – we want to hear from all suitably qualified students. Think carefully about how you can put together the strongest possible application to help you stand out from other students.
Programme content
You'll attend a full-time pre-sessional programme starting in early September. This will consist of preparatory academic classes, the Professional Development Programme, and opportunities to get to know your fellow classmates.
We recognise that students will come to this degree with a broad range of prior academic and professional experience. The pre-sessional course we offer brings everyone up to a common level of knowledge in critical concepts and knowledge. As such, this degree is suitable both for those moving on from recent undergraduate study, and those with professional experience making a career pivot.
The preparatory academic classes will cover materials in both law (an introduction to common law legal systems and the law of contract in these systems, as well as legal financial concepts and rules) and finance (quantitative methods; financial modelling; interpreting financial statements).
The Professional Development Programme is designed to provide a high level of careers support to new students, providing opportunities to develop their career skills, to receive personalised careers support in the form of one-to-one sessions with dedicated Careers Consultants.
Year 1
In the first term, you'll take several courses, including ""Corporate Finance: Law"" and “Principles of Corporate Finance for MSc Law and Finance"", two core courses unique to the programme. These courses have been carefully designed to ensure you can competently navigate complex transactions from both legal and financial perspectives. This includes a holistic understanding of how corporations finance their operations and how – and why – they acquire other businesses.
In the second term, you'll build upon this foundational knowledge. You'll transition to the bespoke “Corporate Transactions: Law"" and “Corporate Transactions: Finance” courses, which will look at a variety of corporate transactions and offer practical insight into real-world transactions and their documentation. Designed specifically for the Law and Finance programme, this cutting-edge course is unique in its structure, interweaving faculty expertise from both the Law School and Department of Finance to provide students with a 360-degree perspective which encompasses an in-depth analysis of financial and legal factors, as well as the interplay between these two considerations. Exposure to practical, real-world scenarios and case studies is key here, with faculty leveraging their professional networks, bolstered by LSE’s position, close to the legal and financial hubs of London, to provide insight into how top firms assess and execute deals at the highest level.
You'll also take several other courses, as listed below.
By the end of the year, you'll have taken courses to the total value of four units.

Learning and assessment
How you learn
How you're assessed
There are two types of course work at LSE, formative and summative.
Formative coursework doesn't count towards your final mark. Formative coursework enables students to develop a sense for how well they're doing in terms of understanding course material.
Summative assessment does count towards your final mark. This can take various forms, such as e-exams/digi-exams, in-class assessments under exam-style conditions., group presentations, individual or group projects, empirical or programming exercises, or class participation.
An indication of the formative coursework and summative assessment for each course can be found in the relevant course guide.
Exams will take place in both the January and Spring Term exam periods. Some courses do not involve a final exam.

Supporting the adoption and integration of generative AI.
The following scenarios have been designed to help clarify King's generative AI guidance for doctoral students, supervisors and examiners.
If you have suggestions for additional case studies, please contact doctoralstudies@.
Your supervisor has suggested that your discussion of research paradigms in your introduction needs to be clearer.
You are finding it difficult to articulate the difference between ontology and epistemology, and how they relate to your research project, so you ask ChatGTP to provide a concise definition of each term.
You’re pleased with its response, and don’t feel you can write clearer definitions yourself, so you paste them into your final thesis. When you submit your RD2 form, you declare that you have used AI software.
As alternative approaches, you could:
The student wishes to run some sections of their thesis through ChatGPT to ensure their argument is expressed as clearly as possible.
You are somewhat wary about the use of generative AI tools, as you are not very familiar with them, so you are unsure how best to advise the student.
When completing your RD2 form to accompany your submission, you see that you are required to declare whether or not you have used generative AI tools when writing your thesis.
This isn’t something you’ve really thought about before. You’ve certainly never used ChatGPT. But you did use Microsoft Word to write your thesis, and Word does often suggest correct spellings or different phrases while you are typing, which you sometimes accept and sometimes ignore. You also use Mendeley to organise your papers and references, which often suggests related papers that might be relevant to your project, some of which have proved very useful.
All of this leaves you feeling anxious and unsure which declaration to select on the form.
You first drafted this chapter early in your second year, and one section in particular contains a lot of factual information that you haven’t revisited since then. To reassure yourself that there are no silly inaccuracies in the text, you paste the section into Chat-GPT and ask it to correct any errors.
You’re relieved when it identifies two incorrect dates and corrects a few other small details, and you amend the chapter accordingly.
Reading the thesis in preparation for the student’s oral examination, you have some concerns about one chapter in particular. The students cites an extensive range of relevant literature, but in doing so they sometimes seem to miss key nuances of certain papers. In some cases, there are outright errors that suggest a lack of understanding.
Although you haven’t engaged with it closely, you’re aware that there is a growing debate about the impact of generative AI on research integrity. Perhaps the student has used Chat-GPT to generate their literature review, and this has caused the errors?
A colleague suggests uploading the section of the thesis into Chat-GPT to see if it can detect any AI-generated text.
In the case study above, potential issues have been identified relating to the criteria that a thesis should 'demonstrate a deep and synoptic understanding of the field of study through its critical assessment of the relevant literature'. These issues are best addressed by the examiner asking questions focusing on this aspect of the thesis during the oral examination, and giving the student the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding.
The examiners would then use their judgement to determine whether this issue will influence the outcome of the oral examination (for example, they might request revisions to this section of the thesis).

As well as unrivalled research skills, graduates of this programme will possess exceptional abilities in writing and communication, alongside critical and creative thinking.
Networking
UCL Italian Studies has many research collaborations and connections with leading institutions, especially in the USA (New York University, Notre Dame University) and the EU/EEA (University College Cork, Universities of Geneva, Lausanne, Paris-Sorbonne, Paris-Nanterre), as well as in Italy (Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Universities of Bologna, Padua, Pisa, Rome-La Sapienza, Roma Tre, Siena, Turin and Venice). This programme is housed within the UCL School of European Languages, Culture & Society (SELCS).
Our research seminar hosts visiting speakers from UK and international universities, museums, and libraries, and we regularly welcome visiting PhD students from universities outside the UK, in collaborations that widen both staff and student research networks.
Teaching and learning
Research students undertake relevant induction sessions and can take advantage of the Doctoral Skills Development Programme. PhD students meet regularly in term time with their supervisors and may be offered opportunities to gain valuable teaching experience and participate in reading groups and conferences.
To successfully upgrade to a PhD, you are required to submit a piece of writing (this is usually based on one chapter from your thesis and a chapter plan for the remainder). You are also required to present and answer questions about this work to a panel consisting of your subsidiary supervisor and another faculty member who acts as an independent assessor.
PhD students should treat their research programme as a full-time job, which equates roughly to 35 hours per week, or 15 hours for part-time students. Students agree to a timetable of regular meetings with the Principal Supervisor to effectively manage the progression of project aims. This is flexible, at some points it may be necessary to meet more or less often.
Full-time students can expect to meet supervisors every two weeks during the academic year, and part-time students every four weeks. If a student has external funding, they should also ensure they meet the Terms & Conditions of the funder.

Supporting the adoption and integration of generative AI.
The emergence of generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, presents both opportunities and challenges for higher education. While these tools can significantly enhance students’ learning processes, and academic skills, and are potentially critical for their careers, it is essential to ensure that students do not become overly dependent on them and continue to develop their judgment, insight, and creativity. Striking the right balance requires providing students with guidance and structure on how to use AI.
The PAIR (Problem, AI, Interaction, Reflection) Framework, developed by King’s College London Professor Oguz A. Acar, attempts to achieve this balance. This guidance document outlines the fundamentals of the PAIR model and discusses its implementation across various disciplines and courses.
This guidance document outlines the fundamentals of the PAIR model and discusses its implementation across various disciplines and courses.
The framework is designed to be (i) simple, providing a straightforward structure to harness the potential of generative AI; (ii) customisable, allowing adaptation to align with specific learning objectives and student characteristics; and (iii) compatible, building on established pedagogical approaches such as problem/inquiry-based learning and active learning, making it suitable for different disciplines.
The PAIR process is encapsulated in four steps (see Figure below):
Students define the problem or challenge they aim to address.
Students identify and choose the most suitable generative AI tools for their needs. This involves exploring, comparing, and evaluating the features of various generative AI options.
Students deploy the selected generative AI tools to tackle their problem, experimenting with diverse inputs and critically evaluating the outputs.
Students assess and report their experiences with the generative AI tools.
Acar, Oguz A. (2023). “Are Your Students Ready for AI? A 4-Step Framework to Prepare Learners for a ChatGPT World”, Harvard Business Publishing Education. Accessed at: 
The three key tenets of the framework are:
For more details of the framework, please refer to Acar’s article here.
The framework has been piloted in over 19 modules across King’s College London during 2023-2024 academic year. The pilot pointed to its potential as an effective and flexible tool for integrating generative AI into the curriculum. Module leaders found it easy to integrate into their assignments, suggesting that it can be customised to fit the needs of specific student cohorts or assignments. The pilot also suggested that the framework shows promise in enhancing AI literacy, boosting confidence in AI tool usage, and promoting critical thinking on ethical issues as well as supporting broader learning goals.
The PAIR framework can be incorporated into existing coursework or serve as a foundation for a new (formative) assignment. For the former application, module leaders could invite students to tackle the whole task or challenge highlighted in the assignment, or parts of it, using the PAIR framework. For the latter, the module leaders could identify new problems that could potentially benefit from harnessing generative AI. It is worth noting that ""problem"" is broadly interpreted as the task or challenge integral to the assignment. This encompasses, but is not limited to, diverse tasks such as analysis or comparison (for instance, of legislation, data, code, case studies, theories, movements, or ecosystems) and creation or design tasks (like developing algorithms, artworks, models, business plans, research protocols, simulations, or chemical compounds). In addition, the framework is suitable for both team-based and individual assignments.
Please see Section 4 for a specific example of how to implement this, with sample material that could be directly used or modified for your own module.
Each component within the framework can be adjusted based on learning goals, available resources, university and assessment-specific marking criteria, and the unique characteristics of the student body to ensure the framework complements the learning environment and supports achieving learning objectives.
This is the foundation of PAIR. Approaches to this in assessment design can include the following:
This can also be tailored per the module’s needs. Module leaders might, for example, suggest a list of freely accessible foundational models, such as Bard, Bing AI, ChatGPT 3.5, or Claude 2.1, in alignment with the learning objectives. In addition, or alternatively, students might be encouraged to explore and select AI tools based on their research. If the second option is preferred, it is important to ensure all students can access the recommended AI tools and recommend that they solely rely on freely available tools.
While there are many AI tools available, with dozens emerging weekly, the majority of current freely-available foundational models are sufficient for most purposes. Table 1 presents the key characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of the primary freely available tools.
This stage encourages students to actively engage with their chosen AI tools. Emphasis can be placed on experimenting with different techniques to understand the tools' capabilities, or on the critical evaluation of results.
Depending on learning objectives, module leaders may guide students to dig deeper into understanding advanced prompting strategies, feedback mechanisms, and the nuances of AI responses. Alternatively, the focus might shift to scrutinising the quality, potential biases, and underlying logic behind AI-generated outputs.
This phase encourages students to introspectively analyse their experiences with the AI tools. Module leaders can provide avenues for students to contemplate the broader implications of AI outputs.
Topics of reflection might encompass AI's societal effects, its influence on specific disciplines, professions, or tasks as well as their identity. Aligning these reflective prompts with course objectives encourages students to better contextualise their learnings and the potential ramifications of AI in the wider world.
In adapting the PAIR framework to coursework, it is important to tailor the complexity of the assignment (e.g. whether an inquiry is open vs. closed) based on student characteristics such as their prior knowledge and cognitive abilities. It is also important for module leaders to have basic familiarisation with the main AI tools including ChatGPT, Copilot (Bing AI), Claude, Gemini, Perplexity and others.
The pilot implementation of the PAIR framework also revealed variations in students’ prior experience with AI tools, leading to differing levels of proficiency. This points to the need for additional guidance, such as workshops and tutorials, to better support students in engaging with AI-enhanced learning. Ongoing support throughout the course is important for maximising the framework's impact.
This section provides an illustration of the incorporation of the PAIR Framework into traditional coursework, such as an essay or report that involves researching and writing about a topic (see also another sample assignment for a marketing module).
Note that the content in italics represents materials that could be shared with students directly or after minor modifications in your coursework guide and/or module outline.
Firstly, module leaders will want to clarify for students that they are encouraged to use generative AI tools for this assignment. The following is a suggested text that could be included in the coursework guidance:
In this assignment, you are not only allowed but also encouraged to use AI tools. The underlying motivation is preparing you for a future that will be increasingly AI-driven by equipping you with key skills to harness these tools effectively and responsibly.
To guide you in integrating AI tools in your assignment, we will be using the PAIR (Problem, AI, Interaction, Reflection) framework.
Next, you will want to expand on the different components of the PAIR framework.
Regarding problem definition, module leaders need to decide whether they want an open, closed, or semi-open inquiry. Using the broad topic of “The Impact of AI in the Next Decade” as an illustration, the following are examples that vary in their levels of 'openness':
Regardless of the type of inquiry chosen, it is vital to stress to students the importance of having a clear understanding of their “problem”— in this case the objectives and requirements of the essay:
Before engaging with AI, make sure that you have clear understanding of your task, and its requirements and boundaries.
Emphasise to students the importance of understanding their needs before exploring relevant AI tools for their coursework. You can offer them the AI tools listed in Table 1 as a starting point, as these tools could assist with various tasks involved in writing their essay (such as brainstorming, generating an outline, conducting research, etc.). It is also beneficial to highlight the strengths and limitations of each tool, as detailed in Table 1, to help students gauge their potential utility.
In addition, consider encouraging students to explore tools beyond those listed, and ask them to compile an overview of the tools they have explored. Students should provide a brief justification for their choices; this overview can be attached as an appendix to their essay. Guidance along the following lines might include the following:
Before selecting an AI tool, determine what you need. Ask yourself questions like:
Next, explore, evaluate and select the most suitable AI tools for your task, taking into account their features, functions, potential benefits, and limitations. As part of your exploration, record your findings in a table, documenting the tools you’ve explored, chosen or discarded, accompanied by brief justifications for your choices. Include this table as an appendix to your report.
This step involves students actively engaging with their chosen AI tools. It is useful to highlight the importance of hands-on experimentation and critical assessment of AI-generated outputs as well as reiterating the significance of problem formulation.
Encourage students to fully immerse themselves in the functionalities of their selected AI tools. This goes beyond merely querying the tool; they should also understand its features, capabilities, and potential limitations.
Tasks might include generating content ideas, crafting an essay outline, seeking clarifications on specific topics, receiving feedback on arguments, checking for grammatical accuracy and flow, or even creating visuals (for instance, using Bing).
Equally important is to remind students to critically evaluate the output— ensuring the information is relevant, accurate, and free from bias. The following offers general guidance worth sharing with students:
Engage proactively with your selected AI tools. Interact with the AI, provide feedback, experiment with various prompts, and critically evaluate the responses. Keep a record of the prompts that yielded the desired results, as well as those that fell short. Should you observe any consistent biases or inaccuracies in an AI tool's outputs, record these discrepancies.
In an appendix to your report, ensure to:
In addition, students often benefit from receiving some tips before interacting with AI tools. The following pointers could be used to help students make the most out of their interactions:
The key to effective prompting is a strong understanding of the problem that you want to address. See a more comprehensive explanation of problem formulation (Oguz A. Acar). But, in essence, you should clarify what exactly you want to achieve. Do you want to generate ideas, craft an outline for your essay, search the relevant sources, or get counterpoints on your arguments? The clearer you are about your questions; the better the AI's response will be.
Break down your task into smaller and simpler components when possible. For example, various phases of essay writing—such as idea generation, outlining, drafting, and refining—can be considered distinct components to tackle individually.
Similarly, treat the different sections of your essay—the introduction, body, and conclusion—as separate elements. If your essay deals with the impact of AI in education, consider narrowing your scope to focus on specific aspects like its benefits, challenges, real-world applications, and future potential. Craft tailored AI prompts to address each of these individual components effectively.
When seeking information or content for a specific section of your essay, be explicit. Provide the AI tool with some context and background about the project or the target audience of your output. For example, if your essay focuses on AI in healthcare, you can prompt:
To get some creative and out-of-the-box outputs, you can play around with constraints (e.g, impose arbitrary constraints, modifying or removing existing boundaries) to explore novel perspectives. Some examples:
Don’t rely on a single prompt to get everything you want. Engage with the AI in a back-and-forth manner, refining your questions based on its responses. If you want AI to change the tone of writing or incorporate a specific argument, tell it. If you find the output too complex ask it to simplify (e.g., “Your explanation on the how generative AI models work was too complex. Can you simplify it for a 10-year old”).
If you are unhappy with the solution set, try reframing the question: could the same problem be asked from a different perspective? Sometimes, it is better to start over, as past conversations often influence outcomes.
The more you use and interact with the AI, the better you will get at eliciting the responses you want. Use it frequently to familiarise yourself with its strengths and limitations.
AI tools themselves are getting better at crafting prompts. So, it can help you too. Some examples:
You should always critically evaluate the output, corroborate it with other sources, and scrutinise for biases or inaccuracies. Before incorporating anything to your output:
Following these recommendations should allow you to better harness the value of generative AI tools.
In addition, module leaders might provide further guidance by sharing other resources and explaining main prompting techniques. See, for example, below:
Here is also a useful practical guide by Open AI for which include some additional strategies and tactics specifically for ChatGPT, but they are mostly appropriate for other chatbots too.
There are also different prompting techniques one can use. The most common ones include: zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting.
A key part of the PAIR framework is the reflection part, and it is useful to encourage students to also include a reflection report. The following guidance would be helpful:
Compose a reflective report in which you ponder over the lessons learned from your essay writing process with the AI tools. In this brief report (500-750 words), answer the following questions:
It is also important to provide information to students about how to use AI and how to report their usage. The following items could be used for this purpose:

Project Title: Optimisation of DNN Accelerators using Bayesian Optimisation
Supervisor: Eiko Yoneki
Co-supervisors: Aaron Zhao
Contact: eiko.yoneki@
Essential knowledge, skills and attributes: Linux, basics of Machine Learning, basics of computer architecture, Python: Experience of using associated tools such as Pytorch, ideally basics of Bayesian Optimisation
Description: A recent trend in deep neural network (DNN) development is to extend the reach of deep learning applications to platforms that requires different conditions such as energy constrained, where in order to reduce the DNN model size and improve the hardware processing efficiency, and have resulted in DNNs that are much more compact in their structures and/or have high data sparsity. These compact or sparse models are different from the traditional large models in that there is much more variation in their layer shapes and sizes, and often require specialised hardware to exploit sparsity for performance improvement. Therefore, many DNN accelerators designed for large DNNs do not perform well on these models. The recent evolution of NN architecture will eventually require transformer model, or GNN specific accelerators, where a complex trade-off between what should be implemented in hardware and what should be left to software needs to be considered.
The project aims at design-space exploration of new System-on-a-Chip (SoCs) especially DNN accelerators using Gem5-Aladdin Simulator, developed in Harvard University [1]. Gem5/Aladdin is a tool for end-to-end simulation of SoC workloads, including workloads with accelerated functions handled by fixed-function hardware blocks. Synthesising chips for experiments is very expensive, but the simulator itself is also expensive to run, and the large parameter space makes it prohibitive to use parameter sweepers (a search space here is ~264 combinations).
Bayesian Optimisation (BO) offers a data-efficient approach to global optimisation of black-box functions by building a model of the unknown function, including the uncertainty about its values we have yet to observe. Using simulation, various objective functions will be examined exploring a large parameter space for the model.
Thus, the task in this project is exploring the parameter space for various models and workload over Gem5/Aladdin. Moreover, such heterogeneous architectural design space consists of multiple design goals, e.g. performance and power and it will add multi objective function for BO.
If time allows, the project will be explored to deal with high dimensional parameter space using the structured BO described in [2] or [3].

This course is open to everyone, and you don’t need any previous knowledge or experience of the subject to attend.
Our short courses are designed especially for adult learners who want to advance their personal or professional development. They are taught by tutors who are expert in both their subjects and in teaching students of all ages and experiences.
Please note that all teaching is in English. You should have near-native command of the English language to get the maximum benefit from the course.
Each week of an online course is roughly equivalent to 2-3 hours of classroom time. On top of this, participants should expect to spend roughly 2-3 hours of self-study time, for example, reading materials, although this will vary from person to person.
While they have a specific start and end date and will follow a weekly schedule (for example, week 1 will cover topic A, week 2 will cover topic B), our tutor-led online courses are designed to be flexible and as such would normally not require participants to be online for a specific day of the week or time of the day (although some tutors may try to schedule times where participants can be online together for web seminars, which will be recorded so that those who are unable to be online at certain times are able to access material).
Unless otherwise stated, all course material will be posted on the VLE so that they can be accessed at any time throughout the duration of the course and interaction with your tutor and fellow participants will take place through a variety of different ways which will allow for both synchronous and asynchronous learning (using discussion boards etc).
Fees
The course fee includes access to the course on our VLE, personal feedback on your work from an expert tutor, a certificate of participation (if you complete work and take part in discussions), and access to the class resources for two years after your course finishes.

The university takes examination and assessment offences very seriously, and sets out the procedures for dealing with any such allegations in the King's Academic Manual, the Academic Misconduct Policy and the Academic Misconduct Procedures.
Academic Misconduct is the adoption of working methods that are outside the spirit of King's regulations and the values of academic integrity and any actions which interfere with the integrity and rigour of assessment undermine the University’s reputation and education standards.
The Academic Misconduct Policy provides extensive information on what constitutes academic misconduct and provides detailed guidance on the use of proofreading services and writing technologies like generative AI. Students are advised to spend time to familiarise themselves with the policy.
What happens with suspected misconduct?
Any instances of suspected misconduct will be reported by the relevant staff member(s) to the Student Conduct & Appeals Office.
I’m concerned about another student
If you see any unfair academic practice or have concerns about potential academic misconduct committed by another student, please contact Student Conduct & Appeals and your department in the first instance.
What is an Academic Integrity Meeting (AIM)?
Academic Integrity Meeting is the meeting convened at Stage One of the Academic Misconduct Procedure. Your department will invite you to an AIM if they have concerns about the work you have submitted.
AIM is not a hearing. During this meeting, you will be alerted to the problems/concerns identified with the work and will have the opportunity to respond.
You will receive further guidance regarding good academic practice, including best practice on referencing or other important academic skills. The department will also discuss with you if there are other academic or non-academic support needs that King's can facilitate to ensure your future works are up to standard and to maximise your academic success.
After the meeting you will receive notes of the discussion and a copy of the materials that were discussed in the meeting. If you forgot to mention something in the AIM, or have other information that you want the department to consider before making a decision on your case, you may submit that within 5 working days from the date of which you were sent the meeting notes.
Can I be accompanied or represented in the AIM?
You may be accompanied by:
- Another King’s community member, including a member/staff of KCLSU
- Friend or family member
Your accompanying person may advise and assist you during the meeting but you are expected to communicate with the department representatives directly.
The Chair will invite your KCLSU Representative to make representation on your behalf at the end of the meeting.
If I don't attend the AIM with my department, what will happen?
Academic Integrity Meetings are important academic meetings that you are expected to attend. If you are unable to attend, please inform the the department immediately, outlining the reason(s) why you can't attend. The department will determine whether the meeting can be postponed.
Important to know: If you are absent from the meeting without permission, your department may proceed in making a decision of your case based on the evidence that they have. The outcome is not invalidated due to your unauthorised absence, provided that you have been given timely written notice of the meeting.
What are the possible outcomes under Stage One AIM?
After the end of the 5-working days, the ASB Chair (or their nominee) will review all information available to them and decide one of the following outcomes:
- No cause of concern, work will be marked as usual
- The concerns relate to poor academic practice but not academic misconduct – work will be marked in line with the assessment criteria
- Academic misconduct has occurred and an outcome should be applied locally
- The case should be referred to Stage Two for further consideration.
What can I do if I am not happy with Stage One (AIM) outcome?
You can't contest the Department’s decision to refer your case to Stage Two of the Academic Misconduct Procedure, but you will have further opportunities to present your case at Stage Two.
If the department concludes after the AIM Meeting that academic misconduct has occurred and ordered one or more outcomes, you may contest the outcome within 10 working days from the date of the written notification of the Stage One AIM Outcome using the Contestation of Academic Integrity Meeting (AIM) Outcomes form.
You should elaborate clearing in the contestation form why you think the case warrants further review and provide supporting evidence of it. In accordance with the Academic Misconduct Policy, the case would only be referred to Stage Two for further consideration if Student Conduct & Appeals is satisfied that:
- There is new evidence or information of sufficient significance that the case warrants further review;
- That a significant procedural or administrative error occurred during the Stage One consideration and the case warrants further review;
- The Stage One outcome cannot reasonably be sustained by relevant guidance on assessment, academic integrity or penalties or
- There are other compelling reasons supported by independent evidence
A contestation is not an appeal but a rehearing. Your case will be considered again by an independent member who has no prior involvement in the case.
What happens in Stage Two of the Academic Misconduct Procedure?
All information, including what you have submitted to your department and information gathered by department will be reviewed by Student Conduct & Appeals who will determine the appropriate next steps. This could either be:
a) Referral to a Misconduct Committee Chair for a decision under the Expedited Procedure
In situations where facts are not contested, such as the student accepting full responsibility for their actions. A full hearing might not be necessary and the case may be referred to a Misconduct Committee Chair to make a decision under the expedited procedure stated in paragraph 7.23 of the Academic Misconduct Policy.
Do I have the opportunity to present my case?
Yes. If SCA considers your case is capable to be considered under this expedited procedure, they will write to you to provide you with the opportunity to provide further information or evidence to the Chair in writing within 5 working days, before a decision is made on paper.
Who is the Committee Chair?
Misconduct Committee Chairs are senior academic staff who have extensive experience in hearing cases on the Misconduct Committee and other student committees like appeal committees.
If your case is considered under this expedited procedure, one of the Committee Chairs who is not affiliated to your department and has no prior involvement in your case will be nominated to consider your case independently.
How will the Committee Chair make a decision?
Even if a full hearing is not convened, the Committee Chair will still read all documents and prepare for the case in the exact same way they prepare for a Committee Hearing. If there is anything that they want to seek a clarification, they will instruct SCA to contact you or the department.
In the consideration of the cases under this expedited procedure. The Chair is supported by student casework specialists in Student Conduct & Appeals who will provide procedural advice to ensure all decisions are made consistently.
Can I request my case to be heard in a full hearing instead?
Yes. If you prefer to have a full hearing, this can be requested in the same 5-working day period. Further instructions can be found in the letter that is sent to you via your King's e-mail.
b) Misconduct Committee
Where facts are in dispute or that the case is complex, your case could be referred to a Misconduct Committee directly. A full hearing will be convened:
- You will normally receive at least 10 days' notice and will be invited to present your case to the Committee. Details of the allegation and all documentary evidence will be sent along with the Hearing invitation.
- You can request reasonable adjustments and have a friend or family member present with you for support, though they won’t be able to speak on your behalf.
- An appropriate staff member will present the case against you, on behalf of the university.
- You will be able to speak on your own behalf, or have a member of the University or an appropriate KCLSU representative speak on your behalf.
- The Committee will determine whether the charge(s) of misconduct have been substantiated.
- Where the Committee concludes that the charge(s) is/are upheld, it may order one or more of the measures available to it under the Academic Regulations.
Following the Committee's findings, the university may refer the case to the faculty, or to a professional, statutory or regulatory body, in accordance with the Academic Regulations.
The decision of the Committee will normally be communicated to you and the examiners within 7 days of the decision.
For further guidance on Committee procedures please refer to our article What can I expect at an Appeal Committee hearing?
Is it possible to appeal against the outcome of a Misconduct Committee?
You may appeal against the findings or order(s) of a Misconduct Committee. If you would like to appeal, you must submit a Misconduct Appeal Form to Student Conduct & Appeals within 14 days of the written notification of the Misconduct Committee's decision.
Appeal Forms received after this deadline will only be accepted at the Discretion of the Principal. If are submitting your appeal out of the stipulated timeframe, you must explain the reasons of the delay and submit relevant supporting evidence to prove your circumstances.
In accordance with the Academic Regulations the grounds for a successful appeal are meeting one or all the following:
- That there is new evidence that could not have been, or for good reason was not, made available at the time of the hearing, and sufficient evidence remains that the appeal warrants further consideration;
- That evidence can be produced of significant procedural error on the part of the university before or during the hearing, and sufficient evidence remains that the appeal warrants further consideration;
- Any other grounds, including grounds of compassion;
The Principal will determine whether the criteria for an appeal have been met. If they determine the criteria for appeal have been met:
- An Appeal Committee will be convened; otherwise the appeal will be dismissed.
- This decision will normally be communicated within 30 working days of receipt of the appeal.
What happens if an Appeal Committee is convened?
- You will normally receive at least 10 working days' notice of the hearing, and will be invited to present your case to the Panel.
- You can request reasonable adjustments and have a friend or family member present with you for support, though they won’t be able to speak on your behalf.
- You will be able to speak on your own behalf, or have a member of the University or an appropriate KCLSU representative speak on your behalf.
- The Committee will determine whether there is sufficient reason to challenge the decision of the original Misconduct Committee.
- Where the Committee concludes such justification is present, they can modify or reverse the findings or order(s) of the Misconduct Committee.
- The decision of the Committee will normally be communicated to you and relevant staff within 5 working days of the decision.
For guidance on the Committee process, please refer back to What happens in the Misconduct Committee?
I'm not happy with the outcome; can I get an independent review of my case?
When all internal procedures are complete, if you are dissatisfied with final outcome; you can request an independent review of your case by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA). You must submit this request within one year of getting the final outcome letter from the University.
The Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA) is an independent body set up to review student complaints. It is free to students and deals with individual complaints against Higher Education Institutions in England and Wales.
Provided your complaint is eligible under the rules of the OIA’s complaints scheme, the OIA will look at whether King's has applied its regulations properly and followed its procedures correctly. It also considers whether any decision made by the King's was fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.

Concerns are particularly associated with academic integrity and implications for assessment; perceived opportunities include supporting students in developing strategies for academic reading and argumentation. During the Long Vacation of 2023, a short survey was disseminated via membership of the General Board’s Education Committee to faculty / departmental directors of teaching (and equivalent). The survey aimed to elicit short accounts of respondents’ perceptions and some accounts of initiatives within departments and faculties to explore beliefs and practices of staff and students relating to the use of generative AI in teaching, learning and assessment.
This paper does not represent an analysis of the affordances and limitations of generative AI in higher education. Rather, it presents an initial, inductive thematic analysis of responses at a particular point in time and indicates significant variations in beliefs and in familiarity with technologies such as ChatGPT. These insights will inform the further development of support for inclusive approaches to teaching, learning and assessment at Cambridge over the short and medium term (one to three years).

The paper is also presented in HTML format below.
Survey: aims and respondents
The survey invited respondents to
- share information about efforts to learn more of students' and/or staff perceptions or concerns relating to the use of generative AI in teaching, learning and/or assessment in their context (for example via surveys, focus groups, working groups)
- comment on questions, concerns and/or opportunities relating to generative AI and teaching, learning and/or assessment in their contexts.
Recognising that the technology is developing rapidly, as is familiarity with its affordances and limitations, the survey was not intended to generate findings which are generalisable; rather, it was intended to generate a snapshot of beliefs and concerns. Analysis of responses will help to inform support over the next two to three years for inclusive educational practice at Cambridge.
In total, 47 responses were received from respondents across 27 departments and all six Schools and from the Institute of Continuing Education: 6 responses were received from Arts & Humanities; 9 from Biological Sciences; 2 from Clinical Medicine; 8 from Humanities & Social Sciences; 9 from Physical Sciences; 13 from Technology. (A breakdown of responses by institution is appended.)
Learning of students' and/or staff perceptions
Question 1: Are you aware of efforts within your institution to learn more of students' and/or staff perceptions or concerns relating to the use of generative AI in teaching, learning and/or assessment in your context (for example, via surveys, focus groups, working groups, other)? If so, please describe briefly any initiatives which you think may help the collegiate University to better understand / support good practice.
Theme One: nothing to report
Some respondents were either unaware of discussions or did not believe there were any current discussions happening within their department / faculty / College relating to the use of generative AI in teaching, learning and assessment. Many said that they were not ‘aware of any’ discussions at the departmental / College level but some had read institutional guidance. Some simply wrote ‘no’ to question one.
Theme Two: informal, local and wider discussions
Many respondents described informal conversations amongst colleagues or local-level discussions around generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. Some referred to conversations around LLMs as a recurring theme within departmental / faculty committees. One respondent noted that a School-wide survey was in circulation and another noted a departmental survey to solicit opinions. Another respondent noted that they had been having discussions on the topic at a sector-level network. Few respondents provided any or very much information on how they are engaging students in the discussion at a formal level; however, one respondent stated that they had been having discussions with students at the Staff-Student Consultative Committee and students had fed back that they would like to use it to ‘help with writing style’ and ‘help with programming’. A few noted that consulting students will be the next steps following staff discussions. Some respondents also spoke through examples of where students have been engaged in using the tool (see theme four: proposals for uses / examples of practice).
Theme Three: assessment (e.g. exams, plagiarism concerns)
There were multiple instances of respondents intending to return to exams and/or consider the format of exams, and specifically in two cases ‘closed-book exam[s]’ and/or in-person exams, in order to ‘mitigate risks’. In a similar vein, a respondent stated that their course is mostly exam-based and so will not be impacted by the rise of generative AI / LLMs. Many noted that colleagues were expressing concern, and the tone of responses indicated a degree of anxiety about the impact of LLMs on assessments (however, see theme six for positively framed responses).
One respondent indicated that their department had responded to the growth of generative AI and potential use of LLMs for assessments by including a large, red, bold-typed statement on the undergraduate Moodle VLE examinations section: ‘Content produced by AI platforms, such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT, would not be original work and so would be considered a form of academic misconduct to be dealt with under the University’s disciplinary procedures.’ Another respondent put forward several possible solutions to the assessment risks of plagiarism, such as ‘the use of testing software that does not allow students to leave the test or import information into the online test’ to remove possibilities of copying and pasting or using external software. The same respondent also suggested using monitored computer rooms for testing and returning to ‘old-style’ testing with handwritten exams.
Theme Four: proposals for uses / examples of practice
A number of respondents described or proposed what they perceived as educationally effective uses of generative AI (see also theme six: positively framed responses). Some respondents indicated that they are starting to discuss and explore its possible uses in classroom-style settings. One respondent indicated that they would be leading a unit on ethical tools and generative AI this coming academic year and another had used ChatGPT with their students, getting them to critically evaluate the quality of ChatGPT’s responses to questions. Another respondent suggested that LLMs such as ChatGPT have their place as useful resources for students, for example providing useful summaries and introductions for new subject areas. Similarly, another respondent remarked that ChatGPT can be asked to provide some useful sources for additional reading in areas the students would like to explore further. Another respondent indicated that they are involved in a research project that is exploring how students can be encouraged to use generative AI critically; they indicated they would like to share findings through the appropriate University channels. Finally, another respondent remarked that ChatGPT is already being used by both staff and students to aid with research and that these tools will become as ‘ubiquitous as calculators’; they argued that engaging with technologies such as ChatGPT and understanding how to use them effectively is important for all members of the University community.
Theme Five: requests for further institutional guidance
Colleagues have requested further institutional guidance, and some have provided ideas of what they might like to see to help guide them on their use of generative AI in education. There were requests for University of Cambridge experts to speak on the subject internally, guidance for students on how they might use it to support their learning and avoid plagiarism, a repository of case studies of using generative AI in T&L practice, further guidance on raising awareness of potential threats generative AI poses, guidance for staff on how to use it effectively in their research and teaching (from ideation, to structuring ideas, to grammar). In contrast, one colleague noted that they knew of a policy at an external institution that embraced ChatGPT as an educational tool and that they did not agree with this. One colleague asked for a university-wide policy, another cautioned against anything that would stipulate university-wide demands on practice.
Theme Six: positively framed responses to the introduction / possibilities of generative AI and LLMs
A number of responses to Question 1 were positive in tone. Some respondents noted that AI has the potential to improve teaching and learning and presents an ‘excellent tool if used responsibly’. Some respondents remarked that high-preforming students are using it like Wikipedia to get introductions to otherwise dense material in order to build their foundational knowledge. Others suggested that through using tools such as ChatGPT, students' grammar will improve in turn as a result of the LLM correcting their grammar, perceiving the tool as presenting learning opportunities for students.
Questions, concerns and/or opportunities
Question 2: what questions, concerns and/or opportunities relating to generative AI and teaching, learning and/or assessment are you aware of in your context?
Theme One: risks (academic integrity, learning, admissions)
A number of respondents expressed their thoughts on potential risks and causes for concern, from admissions to exams and the longer-term impact on learning. Many indicated their concerns for the risks of academic integrity, such as students using LLMs to produce work and submitting this as their own; such responses often inferred a need ‘to return to in-person, supervised examinations’. Others described themselves as feeling ‘helpless’ to stem what they perceived as a likely tide of students submitting plagiarised work, remarking that ‘a “no” won’t stop students from cheating if they are intent on doing so’; others wrote of a need to ‘protect the process of teaching’ from this ‘unequivocally toxic’ tool. For some respondents, advances in generative AI put ‘coursework in jeopardy’. However, one respondent argued for ‘mov[ing] on from simple essay assembly from lecture notes as a training and assessment tool’; they indicated an interest in exploring oral exams and case studies. With these risks and sense of inevitability in mind, one respondent asked: ‘how do we account for the use of powerful (AI) writing aids?’. A number of respondents feared a negative impact on learning if students were to become overly reliant on generative AI to ‘think’ for them, rather than developing their own skills in critical thinking and information synthesis: ‘it is hard to see this sort of AI having anything other than a deleterious effect on practical human intelligence’. Another respondent drew attention to consequences for the academy: with scientific papers now being produced by generative AI, they asked, ‘what is left for us as researchers and educators?’
Theme Two: potential mitigations of risks
Some respondents seemed to be thinking of workarounds for the risks summarised above. For example, a number of respondents suggested that coursework assessment might be accompanied by, or substituted with, oral examination; however, it was noted that this is a labour-intensive option and therefore impractical at scale. Another respondent suggested that students be asked to keep and produce variants of the essays produced, for example first, second and third drafts alongside a plan of reading / structure to show how the essay has been developed over time. Respondents also noted the opportunities presented by LLMs for students (discussed further below) and suggested that to mitigate the risks students should be trained on appropriate use of tools such as ChatGPT, to show both the technology’s strengths and its weaknesses. One respondent provided a case study from another institution that seeks to mitigate the risks posed to assessment: ‘one of [the] assignments is that the students require [ChatGPT] to produce a text. The students then annotate the text, including the sources that were relied upon in it’.
Theme Three: opportunities and possibilities
Respondents commented that the risks presented by generative AI are to be taken seriously; however, a number identified what they considered to be opportunities to enhance teaching, learning and assessment. One commented that ‘ChatGPT is a great prompt to think about diversifying assessment’ to explore options and advantages. Another remarked, ‘I would like to be in a position where I can fully encourage the use of ChatGPT and similar generative AI tools for learning. They are exciting tools – and they will be used anyway’. Others indicated that universities need to understand ‘the changing needs for education in the future’ and that trying to fight integrating generative AI tools such as LLMs into higher education ‘will make the way we teach and run the University obsolete in less than 10 years' time’. Other respondents noted that generative AI tools will be a feature of life after university, as companies start to integrate them into their operations, and so it is important to train students how to use them effectively: ‘AI will increasingly be used to produce any written material... so finding a way to exclude it from exams may not actually be appropriate if we are aiming to assess real-world skills.’
Beyond the rationale (or pressures) to integrate generative AI into education, respondents also highlighted what they saw as the positive opportunities which tools such as ChatGPT present. These included increased productivity of students and staff, where tools can assist with writing, data analysis, coding and act as ‘an interlocutor for ongoing processes of research thinking – asking it questions, floating ideas, etc. Which can be a useful contribution to the research process.’ Others noted that generative AI can provide a digest of literature for a specific topic and that students can use tools to organise their thoughts and materials gathered into a coherent structure. A respondent noted that generative AI can undertake the ‘manual skills that were previously considered essential to scholarly work’ and remarked that consequently, new possibilities are available to scholars. Others remarked that using generative AI for grammar-checking may be particularly beneficial to students with SpLDs and those for whom English is not their first language.
Further comments?
Question 3: If you would like to comment further on AI and teaching, learning and / or assessment, please do so.
Just over half of respondents offered further thoughts in response to Question 3.
Theme One: looking back or standing still
A number of responses seemed to suggest that the University should try to fortify existing practices against the implications of generative AI for teaching, learning and, in particular, assessment. Some respondents indicated that ‘cop[ing] with’ the capabilities of generative AI necessitated reverting to previous practice: ‘back to the exam hall, folks. There’s nothing worse than timed written exams under close invigilation – except for all the other modes of assessment.’ Another respondent called for examination environments without access to internet and advised that the University should advocate for a greater use of oral examinations. A further respondent argued that the institution needs to create ‘faster and more robust ways to deal with cheaters’ and that examiners need better support. Another requested that the University should supply and test ‘resources for detection of plagiarism and renew its honour code’; they considered a student ‘writing with AI [as] a betrayal of trust’ and felt that this position should be expressed by the University.
Theme Two: looking forward and seeking opportunities
A majority of those who responded to Question 3 indicated that they are looking to adapt practice and move forward with developments in technology, in order to improve how students are assessed and enable students to develop skills which would be required in the future. One respondent countered calls to revert to closed-book, invigilated exams, arguing it would be ‘inappropriate (but a fix) to go back to unseen exams in gyms’. They explained their reasoning on two grounds: ‘Will the University fund sufficient internet-blocked machines to permit typed exams and is this really the skillset we should be imparting?’ Another respondent argued that, in order to go forward, ask ourselves ‘why we assess and what the purpose of this exercise is, how does it relate to the goal of transferring and creating knowledge’. This same respondent continued: ‘just like with other new technologies like the book print or the internet [educators] will find positive ways to include LLMs in their education structures.’
Several respondents argued that we must embrace technologies through incorporating them into teaching and assessment so that both educators and students can use them ‘skilfully and critically’. Another argued that should the University not embrace generative AI and consider ways to engage students in learning how to use it skilfully, Cambridge will fall behind other universities in a competitive field. This same respondent also argued that the introduction of generative AI means that colleagues might have to rethink their assessment strategies to incorporate more practical opportunities. There is a strong sense of optimism amongst some respondents, who perceive that generative AI presents greater opportunities for teaching, learning and research and that ‘we will learn to adapt and utilise these capabilities’. Others expressed less optimism, commenting that they are not sure how to address impacts on assessment, but commenting that it will be difficult to ‘ban’ the use of generative AI use; they argued that strategies to support safe use are required. Other respondents noted potential benefits for staff and student workloads: for staff, one commented, generative AI can save time on administration, such as drafting recommendation letters and outlines; another saw possibilities to enhance students’ learning.
One respondent noted that they had asked ChatGPT to summarise questions, concerns and/or opportunities relating to AI and teaching, learning and assessment (Question 2). They described its response as ‘quite sound – for the most part!’ and quoted it:
- ‘Personalized learning: ChatGPT can adapt to individual students' needs and learning styles, providing tailored explanations and resources. It can help address specific questions and misconceptions, making learning more effective and engaging.
- Immediate feedback: Students can receive instant feedback on their work, assignments or queries, helping them identify and correct mistakes promptly. This real-time feedback can accelerate the learning process and encourage iterative improvement.
- 24/7 availability: ChatGPT can be accessed at any time, allowing students to seek assistance or access relevant educational materials outside of regular class hours. This availability accommodates different schedules and promotes self-directed learning.
- Supplemental learning tool: As a supplementary resource, ChatGPT can complement traditional teaching methods by offering additional explanations, examples and insights. It can reinforce classroom learning and encourage independent research.
- Exploring complex topics: ChatGPT can break down complex subjects into more accessible and understandable language. It can help students grasp difficult concepts by presenting them in a clear and straightforward manner.
- Language learning and practice: For language learners, ChatGPT can serve as a conversational partner, providing opportunities for practicing and improving language skills through real-time interactions.
- Research and project assistance: ChatGPT can assist students in their research projects by providing relevant information, suggesting sources and generating ideas. This can be especially valuable for literature reviews and initial exploratory stages of research.
- Encouraging critical thinking: By engaging in discussions with ChatGPT, students can refine their critical thinking skills and learn to ask better questions, consider multiple perspectives, and evaluate information critically.
- Virtual tutor or mentor: ChatGPT can act as a virtual tutor or mentor, guiding students through complex problem-solving tasks and helping them develop problem-solving and analytical skills.
- Accessibility and inclusion: For students with learning disabilities or those who require additional support, ChatGPT can provide an inclusive learning environment, offering personalized assistance and accommodations.
- Practical applications for various disciplines: ChatGPT's versatility allows it to be used across various fields of study, such as language arts, social sciences, STEM subjects, and more, making it relevant for a wide range of courses.’
Concluding remarks
This initial thematic analysis of responses indicates significant variations in perceptions across Cambridge; it is clear from reviewing raw responses to the survey that there is a considerable range of beliefs and levels of familiarity with generative AIs such as ChatGPT within Schools and, indeed, within faculties, departments and Colleges. There is a clear sense that for many respondents the introduction of generative AI, and in particular LLMs, poses a threat or challenge to existing practice. For some, this encouraged a reversion to tried-and-tested unseen in-person exams as a method to assure assessment against plagiarism. Others, who indicated an interest in diversifying assessment, nevertheless also felt uncertain as to how to maintain rigour and integrity. Some respondents offered proposals for how tools such as ChatGPT might be used to support student learning to alleviate administrative burdens. Some expressed a wish for clear guidance from the University, while others argued strongly that such matters must be addressed within faculties and departments. For many respondents, generative AIs invite reflection on fundamental questions of how we understand knowledge, learning and the purpose of studying at university level. One respondent remarked:
In terms of learning and teaching, given the freedom to focus on how to give students knowledge […], I trust that lecturers just like with other new technologies like the book, print or the internet will find positive ways to include LLMs in their education structures
They considered that ‘LLMs will have a very disruptive effect on assessment but without asking and answering the question ""why do we assess"" I do not think we can have a relevant discussion about this’.

This guide © 2024 by UCL - Library Skills is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
This guidance presents UCL's general approach to acknowledging the use of generative AI and referencing generative AI. Generative AI (GenAI) is evolving rapidly and there is not yet general consensus on how to acknowledge and reference it. This guidance will therefore continue to be reviewed and updated.
Before using GenAI, you should ensure that:
GenAI can be a useful starting point to gather background information on a topic, but be aware that:
If you do choose to use GenAI tools, you must always:
The use of GenAI must be acknowledged in any piece of academic work where it has been used as a functional tool to assist in the process of creating the academic work, such as drafting ideas and planning or structuring written materials.
It is the nature of the task that determines whether use needs acknowledgement or not. This will be discipline and assessment dependent, so it is for teaching staff to determine. However, the following general principles may be used.
Instances where use of GenAI may not require acknowledgement include:
Teaching staff should ensure they discuss these principles with their students and make expectations clear. Students should ask teaching staff if further clarification is needed.
The use of GenAI should be acknowledged in an ‘Appendix’ or 'Methods' section of any piece of academic work
Minimum requirement to include in acknowledgement:
For example:
I acknowledge the use of Microsoft Copilot (version GPT-4, Microsoft, to summarise my initial notes and to proofread my final draft.
Further requirements may be stipulated by a department, academic programme or individual teaching staff, or for a particular assignment, and must be made clear to students when an assignment is set. Additional requirements may include expanded description in an ‘Appendix’ or ‘Methods’ section, such as:
These acknowledgements as an appendix should not be included in the word count of a piece of work, unless stipulated otherwise for a particular assignment or by a particular academic programme or department. The appendix should either be placed at the beginning or end of the document.
Some referencing styles suggest that GenAI systems should be cited in a similar way to other sources, most notably personal communications, but there are issues with citing GenAI systems:
This proposal therefore favours the approach of most academic publishers (1-3), which stipulates GenAI systems should not be cited as an author nor included as a source in the reference list.
There may be cases where it is appropriate or necessary for a student or researcher to refer to AI-generated output within a piece of work and / or include it in a reference list, e.g. where the piece of work addresses the topic of GenAI and discussion around outputs, where there is reference to a formally published output generated by AI, where it is required by the academic department, or where a student has not identified a primary source of the information despite the issues with relying on GenAI as a secondary source of information (which may be considered poor academic practice). Students are advised to check with their department.
In such cases, the output should be treated as a work with no author, unless specified otherwise by departmental guidelines or the standardised referencing style you are using.
Where a student or researcher is required to use a standard referencing style which has specific rules for citing and referencing GenAI, the rules of the citation style should be followed, in addition to acknowledging the use of GenAI as outlined above. This may require the use of in-text citations and reference list entries where the GenAI tool is listed as an author. E.g. APA, Chicago.

However, you may believe that there has been an issue with your final published results and would like them reviewed, to ensure the appropriate marks and class have been awarded. Essays or pieces of work which are submitted for feedback and the development of your learning but do not produce marks that count towards your final award, and any provisional marks, cannot be reviewed using the Examination Review Procedure.
If you have taken any University of Cambridge examination, including a PhD probationary examination, and believe that any of the following apply:
- a procedural irregularity in the examination process has adversely impacted on your examination results; or
- demonstrable bias or the perception of bias has occurred within the examination process; or
- the withdrawal of academic provision, which had adversely impacted on your examination results and of which the Examining Board were not aware [this ground is for students whose assessment results have been adversely affected by industrial action].
You can request that your final examination results are reviewed by completing the online Examination Review form within 28 calendar days of receiving your formal examination results. You will receive your results either through your electronic student record (CamSIS) or in a formal letter from the Examiners.
Please include all of the evidence that you wish to be considered, and do not include unnecessary information about other people in your request. Please contact OSCCA using examreview@ if you have any questions regarding the Procedure.
Before submitting a request for reconsideration of examination results you can seek advice from your College Tutor or relevant departmental staff. You can also seek independent advice from the Student Advice Service. If you believe there has been a mathematical error in the calculation of your marks within a paper or their classification, then you should request a mark check from the Department or Faculty to ensure that the marks have been appropriately calculated.
If you are dissatisfied with the examination review decision, there is an opportunity to request a review of the decision. If you remain dissatisfied following the further review, you will have access to the external ombudsman, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator complaints scheme.
If your personal circumstances affected your examination - exam allowances
The University has processes that provide for an allowance or an adjustment to be granted in certain circumstances - in particular, on account of illness or other grave cause in preparing for, or taking, the examination or part of the examination for the degree or other qualification concerned.
- If you are an undergraduate, MASt, MBA, EMBA, MCL, LLM, MEng, MFin, MMath, MMus, MSci, or PGCE, M.Res, M.St. or M.Phil. Degree by advanced study, find more information at: 
- If you are a Postgraduate B.D, M.D, Vet.M.D, Ph.D., Bus.D, Eng.D, M.Sc, M.Litt, M.Phil. Degree by dissertation, or Certificate of Postgraduate Study student, you can use the Examination Review Procedure outlined above to review your examination results where ""serious illness or other grave cause which has clearly impacted upon the examination itself and of which, for sufficient reason, the Examining Body were not aware"" has taken place. Tick the relevant ground on the Examination Review Form.
Examples when an examination review may be upheld
The University conducts many examinations every year, in 2023-34 there were 24,862 students, with the vast majority of these sitting multiple assessments. In 2023-24, 174 examination review requests were received, 71 were investigated and 22 were upheld - a rate of 0.09% of the student population. As a result, while it is highly unlikely that there will be an error in your results, it is not impossible. Some examples of when it might be appropriate to use the Procedure include:
- (ground 1) An error in an examination question, which the examiners were not made aware of in advance of them confirming the final examination marks;
- (ground 2) An examiner knowingly marking the work of a student who has previously submitted a formal complaint about the examiner, and therefore, where the examiner could be perceived to be biased;
- (ground 3) Where lectures have not taken place due to industrial action, and they have not been re-scheduled or replaced but the examiners are unaware of this, and have therefore assumed that students have been taught this material.
However, it is not possible to use the Examination Review Procedure to question the academic judgement of the assessors or examiners. Therefore, a belief that your work was of a higher quality than the mark you achieved, would not be sufficient grounds for an examination review. In addition, if something went wrong in the examination but the examiners are already aware of the matter, then if they have already taken action it is highly likely that there would be no grounds for further action to be taken. Where you believe that the quality of teaching you received, including supervision, impacted your examination results, this is investigated using the Student Complaint Procedure. However, you should raise concerns about the quality of teaching as soon as the issue arises. If you have waited until receiving your examination results before raising a complaint, it is likely that your complaint will be out of time. Waiting for examination results is not a good reason for delaying a complaint and it limits the potential remedies the University can offer.
Reasonable adjustments
If you require any reasonable adjusts to be made to this process, please provide details of these adjustments on the form. If you have a Student Support Document (SSD) which recommends that you receive a certain percentage of extra time, this is automatically applied to any deadlines you are required to adhere to within the Procedure, including the deadline to submit an Examination Review request. For example, if your SSD states that you receive 25% extra time for examinations and the Procedure states you must submit your form within 14 calendar days, you automatically receive an extra 4 calendar days to the deadline. If you consider that the extra time recommended in your SSD does not provide an adequate adjustment to the deadlines of the Procedure or if you have a disability but you do not have a SSD, you should contact us via email (examreview@) to request an extension to the deadline, explaining your reasons and supported by evidence, in advance of the deadline. A request for additional extra time may be granted. If you submit your complaint late, you should include your reasons and provide evidence for lateness with your form. It will then be for the Case Handler allocated to your case to determine if your reasons for lateness are valid.
Raising a complaint about IT issues in exams or coursework
University IT issues
Where students have experienced technical difficulties during an examination, it is expected that they will have raised the issue at the time, as advised by the relevant guidance (which differs dependent on examination mode and platform).
Where the technical issue was the fault of the University – e.g. an issue with the digital platform, this is likely to have been remedied at the time of the exam or as part of the examining process. For example, the invigilator may have given the student additional time to complete the exam to compensate for the writing time used when remedying the issue. Alternatively, where an IT issue has impacted the cohort, for example the cohort could not access the exam paper for a length of time due to a technical issue with the platform, then the invigilators may still give additional time and/or the Examiners will take this into account when marking and examining the students’ scripts.
Where the student receives their examination results and is concerned that the impact of the University’s IT issue has not been remedied, then an application for an Examination Review should be submitted within 28 days of receiving the formal examination results, under the ground of ‘procedural irregularity’.
The impact of University IT issues exacerbated by a student’s disability
Where a student has received a remedy for the University’s IT issues but following receiving their examination results, believes that the remedy has not accounted for the specific disadvantage caused to them because the impact of the IT issues was exacerbated by their disability, the student can apply for an exam allowance.
An exam allowance is a remedy granted to students hindered by illness or grave cause in an exam. It might allow a student to progress to the next year of their course where they had otherwise failed, or to have the relevant assessment disregarded from the calculation of the student’s Class, where the relevant assessment is a ‘small part’ of the assessments undertaken and all other marks are in a higher class than the current Class awarded to the student.
Students should contact their Colleges to support making an exam allowance. The application is normally submitted by the College but can be submitted by the student and must be received within three months of the student receiving their exam results.
The student will need to evidence that they were substantially disadvantaged in the assessment and that the remedy put in place for the University IT issue was insufficient to mitigate the substantial disadvantage caused by their disability. Part of this evidence is likely to include the student’s marks for the relevant exam being out of line with all of their other exam marks.
Student IT issues
Students are expected to take responsibility for their own IT, as outlined in the relevant policy. Where students have issues with their devices, difficulties submitting assessments, or lost work due to an IT malfunction on their device without having regularly saved it, there is normally no remedy available, as students should have taken reasonable steps to ensure that work is saved, that submissions are made in good time and that devices are in good working order.
However, if students consider that their IT issue is so exceptional as to meet the criteria of ‘grave cause’, in that it was serious, entirely unanticipated, beyond the student’s control, close in time to the examination, and independently evidenced, then the student can apply for an exam allowance. As outlined above, applications are normally made with the support of the College and must be received within three months of the student receiving their exam results.
External ombudsman scheme
The Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA) runs an independent scheme to review student complaints, including examination reviews. We are a member of this scheme. If you are unhappy with the outcome you may be able to ask the OIA to review your examination review. You can find more information about making a complaint to the OIA, what it can and can’t look at and what it can do to put things right on the OIA website.
You normally need to have completed the Examination Review Procedure before you complain to the OIA. We will send you a letter called a “Completion of Procedures Letter” when you have reached the end of our processes and there are no further steps you can take internally. If your examination review is not upheld, we will issue you with a Completion of Procedures Letter automatically. If your examination review is upheld or partly upheld you can ask for a Completion of Procedures Letter if you want one. You can find more information about Completion of Procedures Letters on the OIA website.",5,87.9,University of Cambridge,11.5,100.0,20565,5,cam.ac.uk,95.8,2400:00,97.5,97.4,United Kingdom,"policy, administrative communications",4.423919168314668,0.3354297693920335,1944,False,5

Programme website: Global Environment and Climate Change Law
Environmental law is a dynamic, fast-developing and globally important area of law that requires not only specialist legal knowledge but also an understanding of underpinning political, economic and scientific issues.
This programme is designed to equip you with an advanced, multidisciplinary knowledge of the legal issues and techniques related to environmental protection, with special emphases on climate change and the marine environment.
You will analyse and evaluate the historic and ongoing development of international, European and national law for environmental protection, the interrelations between these different levels of law-making and the interactions between environmental law and other areas of law. You may also have the opportunity to take environment-related courses from other University of Edinburgh schools, including the School of Social and Political Science and the School of GeoSciences, and Edinburgh University Business School.
You must complete 180 credits of study – 60 credits are taken in the compulsory dissertation and the remaining 120 credits are taken in taught courses.
You will experience a range of teaching styles on these courses, led by members of Edinburgh Law School academic community and experienced legal and industry practitioners.
You are expected to prepare in advance by reading the required materials and by reflecting on the issues to be discussed, and your participation in classes will be assessed.
For the dissertation you will have a supervisor from whom you can expect guidance and support, but the purpose of the dissertation is to allow you to independently design and conduct a piece of research and analysis.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.
By the end of the programme, students will have acquired an in-depth understanding of concepts, innovations and challenges characterising the law on environmental protection, natural resource management and responses to climate change, at the international, European and national level.
Students will also develop the critical skills necessary to carry out independent analysis of the activity of international and supranational legal and political institutions, national governments and domestic courts, NGOs and the private sector in this field.
Openness to different scholarly approaches within law will be encouraged, by offering the opportunity to complement specialised law courses with courses offered by the School of Social and Political Science, the Business School and the School of Geosciences addressing questions related to the scientific and socio-economic aspects of environmental protection.
The programme is suitable to prepare students for the increasingly broad range of specialised job opportunities offered at the national and international level by the public and private sector, as well as for advanced research.
The Global Environment & Climate Change Law programme is a gateway to graduates finding careers as specialised legal drafters, government advisers, international negotiators, legal advisers to private companies and NGOs, international civil servants, specialised researchers in academic and think-tank institutions and independent consultants.
The University of Edinburgh's Careers Service offers support to students to identify internship opportunities in international and non-governmental organisations, academia and think-tanks. Recent graduates are now working in legal roles internationally, including in India, Mexico and the Netherlands, and for the European Commission.
These entry requirements are for the 2025/26 academic year and requirements for future academic years may differ. Entry requirements for the 2026/27 academic year will be published on 1 Oct 2025.

The formal adoption of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement) on 19 June 2023 marked the conclusion of a long series of negotiations, through which states and other actors have sought to fill gaps in the international legal framework relating to the use of the marine environment and resources beyond national jurisdiction. This vast marine space, composed of the high seas and the International Seabed Area, covers more than 60% of the planet and is home to many unique and fragile ecosystems. However, it is widely regarded as being one of the most difficult spaces to regulate given that the diverse rights and interests of all states must be taken into account. The adoption of the BBNJ Agreement was a major breakthrough for the international community aiming to promote stronger international governance of this common space, as well as offering better protection for the marine environment and establishing mechanisms to enable equitable processes and outcomes. However, the Agreement will not achieve its objectives unless it is fully and effectively implemented by states. This requires action by states at both national and international levels.
The purpose of this project is to map out key actions for the effective implementation of the BBNJ Agreement, with a view to producing policy-relevant insights into what practical steps must be taken to implement this important new international treaty in an effective and equitable manner. The project addresses implementation of all four pillars of the BBNJ Agreement, namely marine genetic resources (MGRs), area-based management tools (ABMTs), environmental impact assessment (EIA), and capacity-building and technology transfer (CBTT).
Equity is a key guiding principle of the 2023 Agreement, which specifically demands that the special circumstances of small island developing states and least developed countries are taken into account, as well as requiring that the rights of Indigenous Peoples or local communities, are considered, promoted, and respected, when implementing the Agreement. One of the central concerns of this project is imagining what equitable ocean governance means in the context of implementing the 2023 Agreement. The project is rooted in a holistic understanding of equity which captures four core elements.
The project has been financially supported by the Scottish Council on Global Affairs under their Insight Award Scheme.

Please refer to the How to apply section.
What is the application deadline?
The deadline for receipt of LLM applications for the 2024 entry course is 5 December 2023. Late or incomplete applications will not be considered.
What do I need to do if the PAO policy requires me to provide proof of language proficiency?
You will need to pass a test demonstrating proficiency in English and submit the results with the rest of your supporting application documents. You should take your language test early enough to ensure that you receive the results in time to submit them electronically with your application. Unlike other parts of the University, the Faculty of Law requires submission of language tests results by the application deadline. The LLM Committee will not consider applications without the required language test results.
Do I have to have a law degree to apply for the Cambridge LLM?
Generally yes, but not always. The LLM Admissions Committee does consider applications from those with a non-Law first degree, provided that in addition to their degree they have substantial relevant professional legal experience or have obtained a professional legal qualification with the equivalent of a First Class result. However, a first degree in Law is the preferred preparation for the Cambridge LLM.
What grades do I need to have achieved to be offered a place on the Cambridge LLM?
Usually a First class degree from a UK university or its overseas equivalent, but further details are available in the Admissions criteria.
Can I apply for the Cambridge LLM if I have not yet completed my first degree in law?
Yes, and we welcome such applications. Note, though, that the LLM Admissions Committee can consider your application only on the basis of grades provided at the time you apply. If you have done well in your first couple of years at university, but possibly not quite well enough to be a strong candidate for admission, waiting for a year until you have finished your degree with outstanding results in the final year may be the better option. If you do apply before you have completed your first degree in law and your application is successful, your offer is likely to have academic conditions attached.
Can I take the Cambridge LLM if I am from a civil law country rather than a common law country?
Yes. Those from a civil law background are welcome, and take the same courses and receive the same degree as those from a common law background. The interaction of students from a wide of variety of legal families greatly enriches discussions inside and outside the classroom. Civil law students are invited to attend a series of optional lectures on the common law held just before the LLM course begins. Students wanting further instruction in the common law method might also consider attending the English Legal Methods summer course run by Cambridge's Institute of Continuing Education.
Can I apply for the Cambridge LLM and another degree programme at Cambridge for the same year of entry?
Yes. However you must make a separate application for each programme, and if offers of admission are made for more than one of these programmes, you will have to choose which offer to accept – you cannot study for the Cambridge LLM and for another degree concurrently.
Do you accept applications from students who already have a UK LLM?
Generally no, but we do make exceptions in cases where applicants plan to use the Cambridge LLM to develop their studies in a different direction to their previous UK LLM The different direction needs to be evident from the application.
How long is the Cambridge LLM Programme?
The Programme starts in the first week of October and finishes by the end of the following June. The University's term dates can be found on the University website.
Can I take the Cambridge LLM on a part-time or distance-learning basis?
No. The LLM Programme cannot be taken by correspondence or on a part-time basis. Since the LLM is oriented around lectures starting in October and ending in May, it is only possible to begin the LLM Programme in October.
How much will it cost to do the Cambridge LLM?
This depends on whether you are from the UK, another European Union country or elsewhere. The PAO provides an estimate of costs which graduate students incur.
What funding options are available?
See the PAO fees and funding web pages for details of the composition (tuition) fees and college fees, and for estimated living costs in Cambridge. This section of the PAO website also provides detailed information about sources of funding, including the online database of scholarships, studentships and bursaries. You can use this search facility to find sources of funding for which you are eligible to apply.
Once I have applied, when can I expect to find out if I have been offered a place?
All admissions decisions will have been made by 1 March. However, it may take further time before you receive notification. Applicants will be notified of the decision relating to their application via their self service account by the Postgraduate Admissions Office.
If I receive an offer, can I be sure I will be able to get a place at the college I would like to attend?
Unfortunately this cannot be guaranteed, since some colleges are significantly oversubscribed. But you can express a preference. And if you are offered a place on the Cambridge LLM you can be certain you will be accepted by one of the colleges, even if it is not the one you prefer.
If I receive an offer subject to an academic condition and fail to meet this condition, is it possible to obtain a waiver?
It is very unlikely. If you consider that your final results have been affected by unforeseen and exceptional circumstances, you may submit a formal request for a waiver to the Cambridge LLM team at llm@.
I have received an offer of a place on the Cambridge LLM, and would like to take up the offer, but I cannot now attend in the year for which I initially applied. Is it possible to defer?
No. In line with general University policy, deferred entry will not be possible for the LLM.
Do I have to write a dissertation as part of the Cambridge LLM?
No, you do not have to write a dissertation, but a dissertation option is available for those who wish to undertake some independent research. For example, in seminar courses, students are examined through a (compulsory) dissertation. In addition, in many of the LLM courses there is the option of writing a dissertation in lieu of the examination. A candidate whose topic is approved for a dissertation in lieu of an examination will receive a prescribed amount of individual advice from an appropriate dissertation advisor. Students may only write one dissertation for their Cambridge LLM, and their chosen dissertation topic cannot overlap substantially with material covered in another course.
I have checked the website thoroughly, together with the PAO website and supporting documentation, but I have a question I cannot answer. Is there anyone I can contact?
Yes. Please contact the Cambridge LLM team at llm@.",5,87.9,University of Cambridge,11.5,100.0,20565,5,cam.ac.uk,95.8,2400:00,97.5,97.4,United Kingdom,"policy, administrative communications",4.434957635515675,0.3970223325062035,1213,False,5

Overview
This is an advanced course on machine learning, focusing on recent advances in deep learning with neural networks and on Bayesian approaches to machine learning. The course will also have a significant component on natural language processing (NLP) applications, including analysing latent dimensions in text, translating between languages, and answering questions.. Recent statistical techniques, particularly those based on neural networks, have achieved a remarkable progress in these fields, leading to a great deal of commercial and academic interest. The course will introduce the definitions of the relevant machine learning models, discuss their mathematical underpinnings, and demonstrate ways to effectively numerically train them.The coursework will be based on the reproduction/extension of a recent machine learning paper, with students working in teams to accomplish this. Each team will tackle a separate paper, with available topics including gradient-based Bayesian inference methods, deep generative models, and NLP applications.
The lectures for this course are not going to be recorded in Hilary Term 2020.
PLEASE NOTE: We will be happy to accept attendees to the lectures if there is space in the lecture theatre. However, we will not be permitting allow anyone not taking the course for credit to attend the practicals or undertake the assignment as we do not have the resources to support this. Therefore, please feel free to come to the lectures as a listener, although if the classroom ends up being overcrowded, we may have to contact you again asking not to join in person.

Synopsis
Note that lecture numbers correspond to hour slots. Thus, for example, the 2-hour Friday lecture will comprise of Lectures 2 and 3.
Bayesian Machine Learning Lectures 1-6 - Dr Tom Rainforth. Course notes are available here. Lectures:
- Lecture 1 - (Week 1 - Wednesday 22 January 12:00 - 13:00) Machine Learning Paradigms: After giving an overview of the course, we will discuss different types of machine learning approaches, delineating between supervised and unsupervised learning, and between discriminative and generative approaches. We will introduce the Bayesian paradigm and show why it is an important part of the machine learning arsenal.
- Lecture 2 - (Week 1 - Friday 24 January 11:00 - 12:00) Bayesian Modelling (1): We will discuss the basic assumptions and processes of constructing a Bayesian model and introduce some common examples. After providing insights to how Bayesian models work, we will delve into what makes a good model and how we can compare between models, before finishing with the concept of Bayesian model averaging.
- Lecture 3 - (Week 1 - Friday 24 January 12:00 - 13:00) Bayesian Modelling (2): After establishing the importance of dependency relationships in Bayesian models, we will introduce some of the key methods for constructing and reasoning about generative models. Namely, we will introduce graphical models and probabilistic programming.
- Lecture 4 - (Week 2 - Wednesday 29 January 12:00 - 13:00) Bayesian Inference (1): We will discuss approaches for estimating Bayesian posteriors, marginal likelihoods, and expectations. We will introduce Monte Carlo sampling along with some basic Monte Carlo inference approaches like importance sampling.
- Lecture 5 - (Week 2 - Friday 31 January 11:00 - 12:00) Bayesian Inference (2): We will introduce more advanced and scalable inference approaches, namely Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and variational inference.
- Lecture 6 - (Week 2 - Friday 31 January 12:00 - 13:00) Variational Auto-Encoders: We will combine a number of ideas from the previous lectures to introduce variational auto-encoders and show how they can be used to learn deep generative models from data.
Guest Lectures: Automatic Differentiation Lectures 7-8 - Dr. Atılım Güneş Baydin
- Lecture 7 - (Week 3 - Wednesday 5 February 12:00 - 13:00, note change of time and day)
- Lecture 8 - (Week 4 - Wednesday 12 February 12:00 - 13:00, note change of time and day)
Natural Language Processing Lectures 9-16 - Dr Alejo Nevado-Holgado:
- Lecture 9 (video) - (Week 4 - Friday 14 February 11:00 - 12:00) Intro and embeddings 1. We first explain what is the challenge that Natural Language Processing (NLP) is attempting to solve, why it is hard, and why every step towards solving it is extremely useful for industry and research. Then we show how the meaning of words can be represented into multidimensional vectors called embeddings.
- Lecture 10 (video) - (Week 4 - Friday 14 February 12:00 - 13:00) Embeddings 2. We describe the different standard methods used to create embeddings, the disadvantages and advantages of each, and currently open (and fast processing!) lines of research that attempt at further improving them.
- Lecture 11 (video) - (Week 5 - Friday 21 February 11:00 - 12:00) Classification and neural networks. We first present the classification task as one of the core tasks of machine learning, and how the tasks arises often in NLP problems. We then describe how general neural networks (NNs) are a very versatile and general mechanism to solve this task.
- Lecture 12 (video) - (Week 5 - Friday 21 February 12:00 - 13:00) Language models and vanilla RNNs. We now present another typical NLP task called 'language modelling', which consists on capturing the probabilities of all possible patterns of speech. Solving this tasks can assist on many other NLP problems. We then describe how the simpler 'vanilla' RNNs partially solve this problem.
- Lecture 13 (video) - (Week 6 - Friday 28 February 11:00 - 12:00) Vanishing gradients and fancy RNNs. We present the vanishing gradients phenomenon, which is one of the core technical difficulties that kept deep NNs from succeeding in the past. Then we show how more modern complex RNNs and some extra tricks mostly solve this problem.
- Lecture 14 (video) - (Week 6 - Friday 28 February 12:00 - 13:00) Machine Translation, Seq2seq, and Attention. We now present another typical NLP task called 'machine translation', and how the so-called seq2seq architectures tackle it. We further show an architectural concept called 'attention' which greatly improves performance in NLP and general NNs.
- Lecture 15 - (Week 7 - Friday 6 March 11:00 - 12:00) Question answering, conference resolution and CNNs. We present the final two typical NLP tasks of this course, called 'question answering' and 'conference resolution'. We then present the convolutional neural network (CNN) in the framework of NLP, and the situations where it might be advantageous.
- Lecture 16 - (Week 7 - Friday 6 March 12:00 - 13:00) Transformers. We finally present the transformer model, which is a specialised architecture module that has greatly improved the performance of NNs across NLP tasks
- Lectures 17 and 18 - Alex Davies, DeepMind

I'm really happy that I chose to study this programme as it not only provides extensive knowledge of the financial sector but also addresses current issues such as Fintech. All of the lecturers are experts in the field, so you know you're learning from the best.
Banking and finance underpins global markets that impact on the day to day activities of businesses and individuals around the world. To work in this high paced legal environment, you are expected to have developed a clear understanding of the regulation and practice of banking at national, supranational and international levels. The LLM in International Banking Law and Finance at Edinburgh Law School caters to those needs.
The principal aim of the LLM in International Banking Law and Finance is to provide postgraduate students with the opportunity for specialised advanced learning in certain key areas of banking and financial law and practice. The programme is forward thinking, considering emerging and developing technologies and their implications on the practice of banking and financing transactions.
The length of courses over one or two semesters plays a key role in fostering deep learning, enabling you to explore a wider variety of subjects in greater depth. You will enjoy significant flexibility in your course choices and can tailor your study to your needs and interests.
The main programme aims are to develop specialist knowledge in banking and finance law and practice, to foster independence of thought, critical reflection and the development of scholarly writing skills at an advanced level in law.
Specifically, this highly specialised LLM programme is suitable for ambitious students and professionals who aspire to pursue a successful career in the field of global financial markets and especially in the areas of:
- finance
- banking
- capital markets
- corporate finance
- financial technology
- accounting and law firms
It is also suitable for those who wish to pursue a successful career with regulatory authorities, central banks, and other public sector organisations. It will help you position yourself as a highly-skilled expert and future leader in the wider area of global financial markets, banking and finance law and regulation.
To enhance and broaden your professional prospects and horizons, some of the seminars in the programme are delivered by leading finance law practitioners/policymakers. This enables the programme to provide you with a good blend of theory and practical expertise.
A successful career in today’s global markets requires an extensive and in-depth knowledge of complex and sophisticated global and domestic finance laws, regulations and practices. This skillset may not be developed without extensive study and a solid understanding of the economic, financial, legal and regulatory theories and practices supporting the operation of global finance.
Based on the University of Edinburgh's strong law and finance expertise, the programme offers interdisciplinary, law and practice-oriented courses examining the legal, economic and political aspects of banking, corporate finance and the relevant regulatory frameworks at national, European and international levels. It also utilises key experience from practice to help you develop practical, problem-solving and drafting skills to handle complex policy, compliance, transaction structuring and completion challenges.
We pride ourselves on delivering intensive, high-quality teaching in small-group settings. This gives you the opportunity to study in detail the topics and subjects above through intellectually rigorous discussions guided by leading academics, including opportunities for feedback.
Seminars are challenging and students regularly present on seminar topics as well as engage in real-life or hypothetical case studies. Through frequent group presentations and by means of testing case studies, prepared and presented collectively by programme students, and students’ own study (revision) groups, you will benefit from the cross-fertilisation of different ideas and experiences. This approach facilitates critical discussion, and enables you to hone your problem-solving, presentation, and team-building skills.
Previous students have had the opportunity to attend guest lectures from high-profile speakers ranging from top regulators, including the European Central Bank and the Prudential Regulation Authority, to highly respected law professors, outstanding economists and lawyers.

The LLM in Intellectual Property Law is designed to equip you with an advanced knowledge and understanding of intellectual property law and policy within a domestic (UK), regional (European) and international setting.
During your studies you will have the opportunity to undertake in-depth study of a range of contemporary issues through our taught core courses in intellectual property law, and develop further critical understanding and research skills through a dissertation on an intellectual property issue of your choice.
The programme will expose you to a broad range of perspectives on intellectual property law, practice, and policy. It covers substantive law on all major intellectual property rights, including copyright, trade marks, designs, patents, and common law protection of intellectual property rights. It also examines these rights within the international intellectual property treaty framework and system. The programme assesses the place and role of these rights by investigating a range of topical issues, which underpin contemporary intellectual property law and policy.
At Edinburgh, we take an interdisciplinary approach and the LLM in Intellectual Property Law will offer you the opportunity to examine intellectual property not just in its legal but also social, economic, ethical, cultural and commercial contexts.
In addition to the core intellectual property law courses, as part of your studies you will have the opportunity to choose courses from the wide range of options offered by Edinburgh Law School enabling you to tailor your studies to meet your specific interests.
The LLM in IP Law has brilliant lecturers, wonderfully designed courses, stimulating 'intellectual' discussions, and students from all around the world.
Intellectual property is everywhere today. The global use of intellectual property has been on the rise in the last decade and it is now an important concern in both developed and developing economies. Intellectual property protection has increasingly been associated with the aims of promoting economic growth, innovation, and creativity.
On the one hand, IP-intensive industries are seen to make a significant contribution to GDP and national employment and bring other socio-economic benefits. On the other, tensions remain between intellectual property rights and the development of information and communication technologies, access to medicines and education, and the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy, to name a few.
The ever-increasing role and impact of intellectual property law and policy makes specialised knowledge of this subject a valuable asset for those:
- intending to enter legal practice and specialise in intellectual property law;
- seeking to work in areas such as the creative industries, cultural industries, manufacturing industries, pharmaceuticals, life sciences, computing, information and communication technologies, etc. with a focus on intellectual property;
- intending to take up a policymaking role in relation to knowledge-intensive sectors;
- looking to undertake further postgraduate study in the area of intellectual property law or pursue a research or academic career.
Edinburgh Law School has been specialising in the field of IP for many years and established SCRIPT, a pioneering centre of excellence in the disciplines of IP and IT law, in 1998. SCRIPT, the Scottish Research Centre for IP and Technology Law, explores the intersection between law, technology and society from a multidisciplinary and multi-jurisdiction perspective. The centre received generous support from the Arts and Humanities Research Council. From 2012 to 2018, Edinburgh Law School’s IP specialists, who are also SCRIPT members, formed part of the RCUK-funded multi-institutional CREATe consortium. SCRIPT continues to be highly regarded and partners the LLM in Intellectual Property Law.
SCRIPT also runs a highly regarded online open access peer-reviewed journal, SCRIPT-ed. SCRIPTed publishes its peer-reviewed articles and analysis pieces on an ongoing, rolling basis, with contributions being collated into three issues per year (April, August, December).
Current members of the IP team (Dr Smita Kheria, Ms Jane Cornwell, Dr Emmanuel Oke, and Dr Amandine Leonard) offer expertise spanning copyright, designs, trade marks, patents, international IP, IP and human rights, and IP enforcement and the relationship between IP, innovation and creativity. Engaging with diverse research methodologies - doctrinal, socio-legal, and empirical – they conduct innovative research examining topics including creative and cultural intersections, international IP, and IP practice and policy. Dr Kheria and Ms Cornwell are co-authors of a leading textbook on IP rights (Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy, Oxford University Press).
During your studies, you may also choose to participate in extra-curricular activities to enhance your learning. Opportunities for Intellectual Property focussed extra-curricular activities vary from year to year. In recent years, teams have entered the prestigious Annual Oxford International Intellectual Property Law Moot Competition. Students have also visited the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art to discuss the intersection between copyright and contemporary art by reviewing some well-known artworks on display, and have been hosted at the University’s 3D printing studio to learn more about developments in this exciting technological field.
The School hosts a range of events throughout the year, including public lectures and conferences attracting high-profile speakers and delegates. In addition, SCRIPT also hosts guest talks by distinguished speakers specialising in issues at the intersection of law and technology. Students on the LLM in Intellectual Property are invited, and actively encouraged, to attend such guest lectures and events to take advantage of the opportunities for engagement with experts in a range of fields

Courses listed below are scheduled for the 2025-26 academic year.
Depending on demand, space on specific courses may be limited.
You must select between 80 and 120 credits from the following courses:
Intellectual Property Law 1: Copyright and Related Rights (20 credits)
The purpose of this course is to consider the law relating to copyright, design rights, database right, and performers' rights within their institutional setting at international, European and national level.
Recent years have witnessed an expansion in the scope of intellectual property rights, and having examined the institutional setting in which policy is formed, the reach and impact of these rights within the UK will be analysed.
The teaching sessions will also highlight areas of particular topicality.Intellectual Property Law 2: Industrial Property (20 credits)
The purpose of this course is to consider the laws relating to patents, trade marks, passing off, and breach of confidence. Noting the international framework and context, the focus will be on European and UK law.
Recent years have witnessed an expansion in the scope of these intellectual property rights. This course will examine in detail the law on subsistence/entitlement to protection, infringement and defences for all of the relevant rights, alongside discussion of wider policy, economic and other considerations.
The sessions will also highlight areas of particular topicality.International Intellectual Property Law (20 credits)
This module will examine International Intellectual Property Law with a particular focus on patents, copyright and trade marks and within the domains of information and communication and international trade.
Having analysed the architecture of the IIPS and considered the ways in which the laws are developed and the tensions that have been brought about through linking IP with trade, this module will go on to look in depth at formal and substantive aspects of the Treaties as well as current developments.
Intellectual Property and Human Rights (20 credits)
Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) affect various aspects of our lives including health, education, agriculture, politics, communications, privacy, and the environment. The globalization of IPRs (especially after its linkage with international trade) in recent decades has equally led to inevitable tensions and conflicts between IPRs and human rights in both developed and developing countries. Historically, the fields of IP and Human Rights evolved independently, but there is now an increasing recognition of the relationship between both fields and this has equally led to debates concerning the proper conceptualization of the relationship between IP and Human Rights.
This module will examine the nature and significance of the relationship between IP and Human Rights. There will be an exploration of the various tensions resulting from the interaction between IP and Human Rights and an examination of how these tensions are being addressed at national, regional, and global levels. In this regard, the module will examine how traditional IPRs (such as patents, copyright and trademarks) interact and impact civil and political rights (such as freedom of expression and privacy) and economic and social rights. Other forms of IPRs, such as image rights and how they impact human rights will also be studied. In addition, there will be an analysis of the issues pertaining to indigenous peoples and the protection of their traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions from a human rights perspective.
Advanced Issues in Patent Law and Policy (20 credits)
Patents are a key component of most modern economies as they aim to foster innovation and promote economic growth. This course will provide in-depth analysis of the legal and policy framework applicable to patents and will answer fundamental questions at the UK, European Union and international level. Recent developments such as AI-related inventions, the litigation of Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) or the question of patent settlements in the pharmaceutical industry will also be included in the course.
- Intellectual Property and Development (20 credits)
This course will critically explore the interface between intellectual property and development from various perspectives such as technological development, economic development, human development, and sustainable development. It will also examine issues relating to technology transfer and innovation policies.
- Competition Law, Intellectual Property and the Innovation Economy (20 credits)
Patents are a key component of most modern economies as they aim to foster innovation and promote economic growth. This course will provide in-depth analysis of the legal and policy framework applicable to patents and will answer fundamental questions at the UK, European Union and international level. Recent developments such as AI-related inventions, the litigation of Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) or the question of patent settlements in the pharmaceutical industry will also be included in the course.
You must select between 0 and 40 credits of courses from the different subject areas offered by the Law School, depending on availability and with the express permission of the Programme Director. Depending on demand, space on courses outside the core courses may be limited.
Full programme details, including core and optional courses is available on the University Degree Regulations and Programmes of Study website.

After graduating from the University of Cambridge, she qualified and practised as a solicitor in the intellectual property team at Linklaters LLP in London. Thereafter she spent several years practising at McGrigors LLP in Scotland, latterly as Director in the Edinburgh litigation team specialising in contentious intellectual property.
Since joining the University of Edinburgh, Jane has acted for several years as Programme Director for the Law School’s online LLM in Intellectual Property Law as well as teaching across a range of on-campus and online undergraduate and postgraduate IP courses. She has also acted as Deputy Director of Postgraduate Taught Studies, with particular focus on online learning. She is a co-author of the textbook Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy (3rd to 6th edns, OUP).
Jane's expertise covers a wide range of IP rights. Her particular interests include trade marks, design law and IP remedies, with a particular focus of the impact of European harmonisation in these fields, including trade marks, designs, patents and breach of confidence.

Linus studied the LLM in Intellectual Property Law in the 2021-22 academic year, graduating in 2022.
""After starting my career in Intellectual Property in Germany I sought to gain a fresh and international perspective on the subject matter. The programme in Edinburgh more than exceeded my expectations and offered valuable insights into the quirks and intricacies of IP – both from a UK as well as a global angle.
Stimulating discussions with fellow students from diverse backgrounds as well as the challenging and thought-provoking guidance by the excellent teaching staff provided new perspectives and impulses invaluable for my future career in IP. Furthermore, innovative and enthusiastic teaching, with references to and the implementation of art, popular culture, human rights, and arising new technologies reaffirmed Edinburgh as the optimal choice for my studies abroad.
Besides that, sunshine on Leith, whisky in the Royal Oak, and hikes around Arthur’s Seat completed my wonderful experience in fairytale-like Edinburgh and offered a counterbalance to at times strenuous (but nonetheless educational and enjoyable) assignments. I can therefore wholeheartedly recommend the University of Edinburgh for anyone seeking to expand their views on IP while spending a year in an enriching, diverse, and eventful environment.""
Zongshuai studied the LLM in Intellectual Property Law in the 2021-22 academic year, graduating in 2022.
""Coming from an engineering background, I worked and studied in Singapore for fives year before I started the study at the University of Edinburgh in September 2021.
Both the city and the course structure drove me to apply for the LLM programme delivered by this University. For the former, I have been impressed by Edinburgh’s stunning views since my first visit in 2019. Meanwhile, the programme structure comprehensively covers each topic of intellectual property, such as patents and copyright, and allows students to explore certain topics or areas further.
During my time in Edinburgh, every sunset I came across reminded me of how lucky I was to be here. Meanwhile, the experienced faculties guided me to broaden my academic capacity with their strict but reachable standards.""
Jelizaveta studied the LLM in Intellectual Property Law part-time during the 2020-22 academic years, graduating in 2022.
""When I chose my master's degree, I decided to combine my passion for art, creativity, and innovation with my knowledge of the law. I was interested in education in Scotland long before and coincidentally, the University of Edinburgh offered an Intellectual Property Law master's programme.
This program is unique because I could not find anything similar in quality and content either in my home country or in other European countries. The program ‘Intellectual Property Law’ is good in its versatility, it provides general information about the subjects of IP law and draws you into detailed discussions on current topics in this area. The freedom to choose some courses gives you the opportunity to realise your full potential.
Even though my studies took place during the active spread of Covid, Edinburgh Law School quickly adapted to the new reality and the quality of education even improved with the use of new technologies. Moreover, I constantly felt support from the Postgraduate Office and the Programme Director.""
Guillem, from Spain, graduated with an LLM in Intellectual Property Law in 2020. In this video he talks about his experience of studying for an LLM at Edinburgh Law School, life in Edinburgh, completing his studies during the Covid-19 pandemic and his plans for the future.
Due to my passionate interest in intellectual property law, once I obtained my LLB degree in China, I chose to pursue an LLM in this subject at the University of Edinburgh.
The programme here provided me with the unique opportunity of studying IP at international level and communicating with fellow students from a variety of backgrounds.
The programme completely satisfied all my demands. The multifarious and thoroughly professional seminar-based courses were both fully interactive and inspirational, focusing not only on the fundamental principles but also on the issues and authentic effects of IP systems in practical scenarios. I have great admiration for these excellent courses which covered academic expertise from both international and domestic perspectives.
In addition, I have immense appreciation for every member of academic staff, particularly regarding their work during the COVID-19 pandemic. They are all incredibly knowledgeable and considerate and have provided me with irreplaceable support.
Living in this mesmerising city made every day a pleasure. The unprecedented academic and personal experience during this year will have a long-lasting effect on my life.

Marleen studied the LLM in Intellectual Property Law in the 2018-19 academic year, graduating in 2019.
""After graduating from law school in Germany, I was looking for a programme which combines fundamental principles of a foreign system of intellectual property rights with in-depth discussions with classmates coming from various countries on issues deriving from ongoing technological progression.
With seminars based on an interactive teaching method, the programme at the University of Edinburgh perfectly matched my interests and helped me to define my academic career in a field of law of ever-increasing importance. The variety of course choices was particularly valuable. In addition to courses on the domestic intellectual property law system, I also got the chance to get an international perspective on the subject. Moreover, I appreciated how the broad variety of courses enabled an insight on the interface between intellectual property rights and human rights as well as European competition law.
The excellent academic education, the approachable lecturers and the vibrant student life in Edinburgh (including various student societies and sport clubs) made my year abroad an exciting and enriching chapter. The specialist knowledge I acquired during the year will be very valuable during my clerkship and my future career in intellectual property law.""

What I particularly enjoyed about the LLM in Commercial Law was that the emphasis was persistently put on learning from each other rather than from the professor who was leading the seminar.
This programme provides an excellent grounding for the future study of commercial law, for those intending to enter legal practice, or for those intending to pursue a career in the commercial sector.
You will benefit from the opportunity to explore a broadly-based range of subjects at an advanced level, and study the law in the fast-paced and varied context of the commercial world.
On this programme, you can benefit from connections to the legal profession and professional networks of the Edinburgh Centre for Commercial Law.
You must complete 180 credits of study – 60 credits are taken in the compulsory dissertation and the remaining 120 credits are taken in taught courses. On these courses, your studies will be led by members of the Law School academic community, most of whom are legally qualified in Scotland, England or other jurisdictions, as well as some experienced legal and industry practitioners.
You are expected to prepare in advance by reading the required materials and by reflecting on the issues to be discussed, and your participation in classes will be assessed. For the dissertation you will have a supervisor from whom you can expect guidance and support, but the purpose of the dissertation is to allow you to independently design and conduct a piece of research and analysis.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.
This programme's structure and courses have been updated for 2024-25 entry. Please visit the Law School's website for further details:
This programme is ideally suited to individuals seeking to begin or develop careers in the fields of commercial law, business or finance. Recent graduates are now working in a variety of legal roles including, following prior or further professional study, litigator and legal counsel in companies such as Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Standard Life.

Cavendish Quantum Mechanics Primer

This primer takes able readers from their penultimate school year to well into the second year quantum mechanics course in physics at Cambridge University. It is not a textbook, but a primer introducing essential ideas, analytical skills and the solving of problems --- much in the style of the Cambridge physics course.

Chapters 1 - 3 expand the lectures given at the Senior Physics Challenge (SPC) - Isaac Physics (

), a Cambridge Physics development course for schools. Chapters 2 - 5 are also suitable for university courses.

Chapter 1 is available as a free sample. For this and for further details of the Primer, including details also of how to order in bulk, see Quantum Mechanics Primer - Isaac Physics  (

Chapter 1 revises essential school mathematics and classical physics used throughout this book and in higher physics generally. It also prepares for university entrance. Readers will find the required calculus and functions familiar, but will be guided to their use in solving physical problems. Such fluency and facility is essential for further study and for the transition to university.

Subsequent chapters explore ideas of confinement and uncertainty energies, atoms, pair production, tunnelling into forbidden regions, the quantum oscillator and the quantisation of strings and oscillations of fields, higher dimensions, particles in nano-structures, and quantum dynamics. Readers solve such problems in their full mathematical depth. Some problems are solved as examples, others have hints only.

Books are sold (UK only) at cost price, £1.50 per copy, (+ pp £2.50 per book, UK 2nd class post) for orders of 1 or 2 books.

Supporting the adoption and integration of generative AI.
This section outlines King's approach to the use of generative AI tools which align with the principles formulated by the Russell Group. It underscores the collective recognition among educational institutions of the importance of developing AI literacy among students and staff, the ethical use of AI, and maintaining academic rigor and integrity.
King’s contributed to and subscribes to the Russell Group’s five principles on the use of generative AI tools in education:
Each of these has implications for King's staff and for their students. For this reason, governance has been framed with these statements in mind and these principles should be acknowledged as framing and as the launch point for AI literacy work support for staff and students to be able to be critically reflective in their interactions with generative AI, and to inform any programme or assessment modifications we seek to make. Each of the principles is clarified in the Russell Group website.
At King’s we are committed to ensuring both staff and students receive clear guidance on the ethical dimensions and data security issues and how these relate to existing and evolving policy. In line with the Russell Group principles, the following clarifications to policy cover data privacy, bias potential, accountability for generated information and broader ethical issues. All use should be cognisant of existing King’s policy.
We are witnessing incredibly rapid changes and a potential revolution in ways of working, but with a lack of transparency in the training of generative AI models, training data biases apparent in outputs, intellectual property ownership disputes and data privacy concerns. These combine to present a complex ethical landscape. On the one hand we have an obligation to best support and prepare our students for what is ahead, whilst at the same time need to recognise the many unresolved (even unresolvable) issues and the concomitant academic integrity and skills development implications.
Existing ethical codes apply to the adoption and use of generative AI. AI tools generate responses based on human-created data. As such, they might replicate any societal biases and stereotypes that are embedded in the information they have been trained on. Whilst companies hosting generative AI tools tend to claim outputs are original and therefore not plagiarised, this is an area of ongoing complexity and dispute and thus represents ongoing risk. Furthermore, it is noted that some AI tool developers have outsourced reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to low wage workers. Finally, the training of generative AI tools involves some quite astounding carbon emission and water consumption, suggesting potentially profound environmental impacts.
Our goal should be to follow and champion ethical and critical practices that seek authentic, accurate and safe use of any generative AI tool that is sustainable and values user empowerment.
See Bentley et al.'s working paper for more detail on ethical implications and a broad framework for responsible use.
Even if an AI tool isn't explicitly trained from user inputs, there exist potential risks related to privacy and intellectual property. This is due to the information that staff and students potentially input into the system. For this reason, it is important that King’s staff do not, without explicit permission, use unsupported tools such as ChatGPT to scrutinise student work. In addition, and despite the name of the leading company in this domain, there is great secrecy about details of how models are trained and the sources of the training data as well as how customer data within products is used. If you are logged into your King’s account and use Microsoft Copilot your inputs (‘prompts’) and outputs are not shared and data cannot be used to train foundation models.
AI tools derive their data from various sources, some of which might be unreliable or incorrectly referenced. Moreover, any unclear commands or information could be misconstrued by the AI, leading to erroneous or out-of-date outputs. Thus, users must bear the responsibility for the accuracy of the information produced by these tools in different contexts.
King’s position can be summed up from this line in the academic integrity policy:
The advent of widely available generative AI does little to change this in the short term, though as tools such as Microsoft Co-Pilot become increasingly embedded within products we use daily such as Microsoft Word, the blurring of authorship will present additional challenges. The ‘given’ that students’ own words, ideas and judgements provide the substantive core of summative submissions remains and should of course be reinforced, restated at intervals and unpicked at programme level with new students at the earliest opportunity.
Submitting text generated by technology/artificial intelligence as their own, without written permission from their department is considered misconduct under the offences of third-party involvement or text manipulation, if it provides undue advantage or interferes with assessment of the student's own understanding.
The student guidance on academic honesty and integrity should be connected to discussions on appropriate use of generative AI.
The complication with generative AI is that detection tools are at best unreliable and, at worst, may present false positives. Misunderstandings about how large language models work has led to academics in other institutions using tools like ChatGPT to gauge student integrity, resulting in wide-scale false accusations. King’s took the decision not to enable the AI detection % in Turnitin due to concerns about its reliability and potential for false positives. As things stand AI detection is not an option that is available to us. It is, however, a potentially lucrative market so we should anticipate developments amongst the efforts to secure our business.
Therefore, and in many ways similar to the mechanisms we have used for some time to confront suspicions about submitted work via contract cheating, we are reliant on very subjective measures. For this reason, it is imperative students should never be ‘accused’ of cheating or dishonesty, especially if the suspicion is that work has been created with generative AI.
However, whilst we hope that everything will be done pre-emptively in terms of assessment design, engaging students in discussion about technology and ethics and in proffered support we recommend that induction programmes, KEATS resources and assignment briefs will include reiteration of how use of generative AI to gain an unfair advantage and/or without proper acknowledgement falls within the academic misconduct guidance. Students suspected of using generative AI in the first instance may be invited for an investigatory meeting with procedures aligned to existing academic misconduct procedures.
This is guidance not policy and it is intended to assist decision-making across a range of disciplines at King's. It should be considered alongside the Academic Policy and Procedure which can be found here: Academic Misconduct Policy | King's College London and any faculty or programme level guidance given. If the reader finds any apparent inconsistency between this Guidance and the Academic Policy and Procedure or any other policy then please do note the precedence of Policy over guidance. Failure to do so could lead to misconduct proceedings being taken. The Non-Academic Misconduct Policy | King's College London may also apply to any misrepresentations of AI use.
King's staff are encouraged to review their assessment briefs and to ensure clarity around acceptable use in that documentation. This could be done at programme, module or individual assessment level according to needs and ways of working within each department. See guidance on ‘defining appropriate use’ for further information.
Please note, at King's we will seek to define acceptable/fair use rather than trying to specify what is prohibited. An assessment is designed to both develop and evaluate your progress so it is never appropriate to submit chunks of text or other media that are duplicated from another source without clear acknowledgement. Because tools like ChatGPT are generating text on a predication model they are not quotable sources and are not appropriate places to focus research.
King’s College London, unlike some other universities, does not require students to reference generative AI as an authoritative source in the reference list for much the same reason you would not be expected to cite a search engine, a student essay website or be over-dependent on synoptic, secondary source material. However, as we learn more about the capabilities and limitations of these tools and as we work together to evolve our own critical AI literacies, we do expect you to be explicit in acknowledging your use of generative AI tools such as Large Language Models like Microsoft Copilot (available via your KCL account), Google Gemini or ChatGPT or any other media generated through similar tools.
You should select one of the following two statements, complete it and append it to your references or somewhere prominent with your submission. Please note that so long as acknowledged use falls within the scope of appropriate use as defined in the assessment brief/guidance then this will not have any direct impact on the grades awarded.
Declarations in (2) below are an important reflective step and should be considered necessary.
1. I declare that no part of this submission has been generated by AI software. These are my own words.
Note. Using software for English grammar and spell checking is consistent with Statement 1.
[or]
2. I declare that parts of this submission has contributions from AI software and that it aligns with acceptable use as specified as part of the assignment brief/guidance and is consistent with good academic practice. The content can still be considered as my own words. I understand that as long as my use falls within the scope of appropriate use as defined in the assessment brief/guidance then this declaration will not have any direct impact on the grades awarded.
I acknowledge use of software to [include as appropriate]:
(i) Generate ideas or structure suggestions, for assistance with understanding core concepts, or other substantial foundational and preparatory activity.
[insert AI tool(s) and links and/or how used]
(ii) Write, rewrite, rephrase and/or paraphrase part of this essay.
[insert AI tool(s) and links]
(iii) Generate some other aspect of the submitted assessment.
[insert AI tool(s) and links]/include brief details]
It is important to model open and honest practices to our students and that they might expect us to declare where generative AI software has been used and how it has been used.
Suggested wording:
[name/s/programme or module team] acknowledge/s the use of [named generative AI software] to [define purposes]
In line with the Russell Group statement that universities will support students and staff to become AI-literate, King’s has a responsibility to provide support to all students on how to engage with generative AI during their time at King’s and beyond. King’s sees this as a key academic skill that students will need to develop to succeed in their studies and career.
To enable this, an understanding of the development needs of students is key. Some of these needs will be evident swiftly, and others will emerge over the coming years. Some support, largely around responding to the King's-wide policy, will be provided at university-level, and others at a faculty and/or department level. As with other academic skills, the needs of students will vary. A key area of support that all programme and module leaders can provide is to ensure that all assessment guidance includes a clear statement about appropriate use (see guidance on ‘defining appropriate use’ for further information).
The existing providers of academic, digital, and data literacy skills support (King’s Foundations, CTEL, and Libraries and Collections, Centre for Doctoral Studies) will need to work closely with King’s Academy to be able to provide a coherent and comprehensive level of support and skills development provision to King's students.

Postgraduate Research Fund

Candidates for the degrees of PhD and MPhil (where the course is more than 50% research based) are ordinarily eligible to apply for expenses which will be incurred during the first nine terms (or for MPhils, 3 terms) of their degree. Very exceptionally, the Postgraduate Tutors may consider an application after this time. Applications for major items, other than conference attendance or thesis preparation, will not normally be considered after the first six months of the third year of residence. MPhils are formally classified as “research” or “taught” degrees by the Student Registry. If you are unsure of your status in this respect, please consult the Graduate Office Administrator.

Students may apply for research funds, with a cumulative maximum grant of £1000, with ordinarily a maximum grant of £500 per application and per academic year. Part-time PhD students may apply for up to £350 as may research MPhil students; if the student subsequently carries on to read for a PhD degree, the amount awarded will be counted towards the cumulative maximum grant. Students are not eligible to apply for any period during which they have intermitted (and that period will not count towards the nine-term limit); students who have leave to work away are eligible to apply for research funds (and, correspondingly, that period will count towards the nine-term limit).

Parry Dutton Student Fund & North America Foundation Fund

is for grants to students for periods of travel, residence, or study in the United States of America with the aim of strengthening Anglo-American relationships. The

North America Foundation Fund

is for students from the United States or Canada only. It is primarily aimed at MBA students at the Judge Business School, but other graduate students may apply.

Grants are ordinarily limited to those in their first nine terms for candidates for the degree of PhD, or for students on one-year courses (MPhil, MBA, LLM, MCL, PGCE, CASM), the first three 3 terms of their degree. Vet MB and MB students may apply any time during their nine terms of postgraduate clinical study.

As with the postgraduate research allowance, students are not eligible to apply for any period during which they have intermitted (and that period will not count towards the usual nine-term limit); students who have leave to work away are eligible to apply for research funds (and, correspondingly, that period will count towards the usual nine-term limit).

Students may normally apply for funding up to a maximum of £1,500. In exceptional cases requests for a higher amount may be considered. All applicants should be aware though that the award of funds is a competitive process and the judgement of the Postgraduate Tutors will be final.

Any award which may be given is conditional upon a 500 word report being supplied to the College within one month of completion of the research. Please submit your completed application form for either of these funds to the Postgraduate Tutors' Office. (The application form is the same as for Postgraduate Research Expenses.)

The Scott Morten Fund and Whittington Fund

These funds are for students visiting MIT, or visiting from MIT and to support students in Earth Sciences and Biology. They are available on the same terms as the North America Foundation Fund and Parry Dutton Student Fund.

Awards for Music and University Sports

There are some music awards that are open to postgraduate students participating in music activity. There is also a small award for those who play Blues Sports (applications for this are sought after by email towards the end of each academic year).

College Hardship Funds

The College’s Student Hardship Fund, administered by the Tutors, provides financial assistance for students who experience unforeseen financial difficulties. When the situation is purely temporary, the Tutorial and Student Finance Manager will be able to advise you and agree a rescheduling of your College Bill. When the financial problem cannot be solved in this way, you should contact the Postgraduate Tutors. The Hardship Fund can provide discretionary grants, typically ranging from reimbursement of incidental expenses incurred through illness, to partial rent rebates, to larger grants of several hundred pounds.

Details about the College Bill, and how to pay it, can be found on the

Ms. Wermuth will then forward it to the respective academic supervior. Please don't submit any hard copy, only if your supervisor asks for it. Furthemore, you need to send the prefilled assessment form.
General information of the TUM about theses and helpful information you can find here.
Students can use AI tools such as Grammarly or ChatGPT according to levels 1 to 4 of the AI Assessment Scale. Further information on the AI Assessment Scale can be found at: Perkins, M., Furze, L., Roe, J., & MacVaugh, J. (2023). Navigating the generative AI era: Introducing the AI assessment scale for ethical GenAI assessment. arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.07086.
An adaptation of the AI Assessment Scale:
To document AI use transparently, the declaration of authorship must state which AI tools have been used at which level (according to the AI Assessment Scale) for the introduction, theory, methods, results, and discussion sections including the purpose (the result produced after using AI, e.g., brainstorming ideas, formulating texts).
The number or combination of AI use levels A–D has no bearing on the final grade, but must be reported for documentation and transparency purposes. Level E is not allowed.
It is not required to indicate the use of Word tools to check spelling and punctuation.
A template for such a declaration on AI use (the complete declaration template, you can find in the section Guidelines and Templates ↑):
- For the final thesis, enrollment is mandatory until completion and submission. This also applies if the period for writing the thesis was extended for reasons beyond your control.
- Please pay attention that the assessment of the Master's thesis might take two months. However, the date of the submission of the thesis will become the graduation date (provided that the thesis is the last examination!).
- The completion of the graduation documents might take a few weeks, but a preliminary degree certificate can be downloaded from TUMonline as soon as the process of issuing the graduation documents has been initiated.

- encouragement of further study
This course is open to everyone, and you don’t need any previous knowledge or experience of the subject to attend.
Our short courses are designed especially for adult learners who want to advance their personal or professional development. They are taught by tutors who are expert in both their subjects and in teaching students of all ages and experiences.
Please note that all teaching is in English. You should have near-native command of the English language to get the maximum benefit from the course.
Each week of an online course is roughly equivalent to 2-3 hours of classroom time. On top of this, participants should expect to spend roughly 2-3 hours of self-study time, for example, reading materials, although this will vary from person to person.
While they have a specific start and end date and will follow a weekly schedule (for example, week 1 will cover topic A, week 2 will cover topic B), our tutor-led online courses are designed to be flexible and as such would normally not require participants to be online for a specific day of the week or time of the day (although some tutors may try to schedule times where participants can be online together for web seminars, which will be recorded so that those who are unable to be online at certain times are able to access material).
Unless otherwise stated, all course material will be posted on the VLE so that they can be accessed at any time throughout the duration of the course and interaction with your tutor and fellow participants will take place through a variety of different ways which will allow for both synchronous and asynchronous learning (using discussion boards etc).
Fees
The course fee includes access to the course on our VLE, personal feedback on your work from an expert tutor, a certificate of participation (if you complete work and take part in discussions), and access to the class resources for two years after your course finishes.
Concessions
For more information, please see our concessions information page.

Programme website: Law
This general LLM programme is the ideal choice for students wishing to expose themselves to diverse areas of advanced legal scholarship. We offer a very wide range of specialist courses, many taught by internationally recognised experts in their fields, and legal and industry professionals.
You will select courses from across the School’s key research and teaching fields, including:
- commercial law
- criminal law
- criminology
- EU law
- IP, media and technology law
- international law
- legal history and legal theory
- medical law
- private law
- public law
This structure ensures you can pursue a truly diverse and challenging curriculum through which you will be able to develop a broad expertise in cutting-edge legal scholarship.
This programme is made up from 120 credits of taught courses and a 60-credit dissertation on an approved topic (generally one that builds upon one of the courses that you have studied with us).
There are no compulsory courses on the general LLM that all students have to take. Instead you may choose from the diverse range of specialist courses offered within the School (subject to the availability of places or whether courses are running in a given year). However, as the General LLM qualification reflects expertise across a range of subjects, there are limits on the number of courses which can be taken from any one subject area.
You will experience a range of teaching styles on this programme and we expect you to prepare in advance by reading the required materials and reflecting on the issues to be discussed. We will assess your participation in classes.
For the dissertation, we will allocate you a supervisor, who will provide guidance and support. The purpose of the dissertation however, is to allow you to independently design and conduct an original piece of research and analysis.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.
Find out more about compulsory and optional courses
We link to the latest information available. Please note that this may be for a previous academic year and should be considered indicative.
By the end of this programme, you should have acquired a more sophisticated understanding of your chosen subjects, including the diverse functions of law in contemporary society, differing approaches to the subject and a greater familiarity with research materials and methods.
The LLM in Law is an excellent way to broaden ones knowledge across a range of areas of legal specialism, gain understanding of the synergies and principles applicable across legal disciplines and identify areas of interest for a career in legal practice or academic research.
Many recent graduates have used the programme as a platform for further study. Others who are professionally qualified are now working as:
- attorneys
- lawyers
- legal advisers and specialists
- financial analysts
- tax associates
For organisations including:
- Deloitte
- The Royal Bank of Scotland
- the Brooklyn Supreme Court
- the Supreme Court of Japan

About this degree
The number of individuals with complex systemic disease that may impact upon oral health and the provision of dental care is rising. Increasing lifespans have led to an increase in cardiac, neurological, endocrine, and other disease processes. Special Care Dentistry is now more relevant than ever to ensure all patients are managed appropriately to enhance their function and quality of life.
Our Special Care Dentistry MSc provides a detailed understanding of the common systemic disorders likely to be of implication for routine dental care. You will gain an understanding of the appropriate management and the ability to undertake clinical investigations for patients with systemic disease likely to complicate dental treatment.
We emphasise putting theory into practice to ensure that graduates are well equipped to manage patients with complex needs and help them maintain good oral health and general wellbeing.
Our students are taught in new facilities in the heart of London and the campuses of UCL and UCLH NHS Foundation. All clinical teaching takes place within the newly opened UCLHT Eastman Dental Hospital, while all non-clinical teaching is within UCL Eastman Dental Institute. The facilities within these sites and the UCL libraries provide a unique twenty-first century educational experience.
Who this course is for
The programme is directed towards dentally qualified clinicians who wish to extend their knowledge and skills in special care dentistry to become a competent practitioner in the field within and outside the United Kingdom.
What this course will give you
This programme offers you the following benefits and opportunities:
- Teaching in new facilities in the heart of London. All clinical teaching takes place within the newly opened UCLHT Eastman Dental Hospital.
- Friendly, welcoming staff, and a highly experienced Professional Services team.
- A comprehensive education portfolio.
- Teaching by national and international leaders of special care dentistry and allied subjects who bring a wealth of experience in teaching at the postgraduate level and the clinical care of patients with complex needs.
- Access to a wealth of online material allied to the course and UCL library services.
The foundation of your career
Students establish important working collaborations with staff at the institute and other parts of UCL. They will be encouraged to present aspects of their work at international conferences, which provides further opportunities to collaborate with specialists from across the globe.
My aims are to establish a dental service in the Middle East serving both children and adults with special care, and to teach these dental aspects at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.
Employability
The course provides students with knowledge, skills, and collaborations to further their clinical careers. According to the HESA Graduate Outcomes survey (2018-2022), 80% of Special Care Dentistry graduates have remained in, or progressed onto, highly skilled work in dental practice. This includes roles in UK NHS Trusts and overseas in dental services and governments in Australia and Hong Kong. The remainder went onto further study.
Historically, former students have gone on to become specialists and/or consultants in special care dentistry in the UK and abroad. Some have gone on to establish special care dental services, create undergraduate or postgraduate programmes, and become leaders of specialist organisations relevant to special care dentistry.
Notable alumni

Networking
There are regular networking opportunities, including events where you can hear from expert speakers. We encourage students to broaden their skills and expand their networks by attending and participating at conferences.
Teaching and learning
The programme is delivered through a combination of lectures, tutorials, seminars, journal clubs and clinics organised by staff from the institute and its allied hospital. The more didactic elements of teaching are delivered via online and face-to-face lectures, seminars, and tutorials. All clinical teaching is provided via attendance at the many clinics of special care dentistry in UCLHT Eastman Dental Hospital.
Assessments / examinations include:
- Essay-type written examinations
- Completion of a logbook of clinical activities
- Completion of case reports
- Completion of written dissertation
- Viva-type examinations.
The programme is approximately 46 weeks long and extends over one academic year with students expected to attend in person throughout.
The workload will be roughly equivalent to a full-time job. Approximately 25% of your time (around 10 hours per week) is dedicated to lectures, seminars, and other teaching activities.
The remaining 75% is allied to clinical teaching via direct patient contact (around 20 hours per week) and personal study, which includes completing a research dissertation (around 10 hours per week).
In view of its clinical nature, students will attend the Bloomsbury Campus on most weekdays throughout the programme.

Modules are undertaken in parallel. You will receive conventional teaching as well as clinical teaching spread across each week of the programme. In the early stages, teaching is principally conventional to ensure you have the understanding to be able to manage patients appropriately.
-
The programme can be taken part-time over two academic years. While we make every effort to accommodate the needs of students, it is essential that:
- In the first year, students always attend on a Monday, when the majority of lectures are delivered.
- Students attend for two or three consecutive days in the first year (with additional contact days during the induction period).

Only a few programmes have deadlines by which you should apply – decisions are mostly made on a rolling basis, which means that a programme will close once all of the available places have been filled. You must therefore check the current availability of your chosen programme(s) and submit your application early to give yourself the best chance of obtaining a place.
Many scholarships, however, especially for research programmes, have early deadlines. See individual programme pages and the fees and funding page for details of particular deadlines.
Once we have received and processed your application, you should expect to wait an average of 8 weeks for a decision if you are applying for a taught master’s programme. Decisions for research programmes may take longer than this.
Your submitted application will be received and processed by the admissions team only once we have received a reference from each of the referees you nominate in your online application.
Research funding deadlines
Please note: to be considered for LSE PhD Studentships or ESRC Doctoral Training Partnership Scholarships (for 1+3 or +3 funding), you must submit your complete application, including ALL supporting documents, by the following deadlines
- 1 December 2024 (Research programmes in the Law School)
- 18 December 2024 (MRes/PhD Economics and MRes/PhD International Development)
- 15 January 2025 (first funding panel deadline including ESRC) *
- 25 April 2025 Final funding deadline
*Please note: to be considered for ESRC DTP Scholarships you must apply by the first funding panel deadline.
Applications received or completed after the deadline will not be considered for LSE research scholarships. We will always do our best to make sure that applications received just after the deadline reach the departments in time to be considered, but it is much better to plan ahead and submit early.
Please be aware that some departments only make submissions to the earlier funding panels, and earlier applications have more chance of being considered for funding - check individual programme pages for details.
Some programmes will continue to accept applications for places after these deadlines, however it may not be possible to consider you for LSE funding.
Remember that your submitted application cannot be considered until we have received a reference from each of the referees you nominate in your online application.
Previous applicants
If you are unsuccessful, or are unable to take up your place in 2024/5, you have until 16 November 2024 to reinstate your application to be considered in the next admissions cycle for entry in 2025/6. As long as you complete the reinstate form before the deadline, we will re-use the documents that you sent to us, including your transcripts and references. Please note that it is only possible to reinstate your application once, for the following cycle, so if you initially applied before 2024/5, you should start and submit a new application from scratch.
The reinstatement fee is £95.
Start dates
Our main taught master's (MSc/MA/MPA/LLM) programmes start in the autumn term (late September). Some programmes, particularly those in the Departments of Economics, Accounting, Finance and Management, require attendance at Summer School or introductory courses in the July-September months before the main programme begins.
Executive master’s programmes start at different times of the year depending on their mode of teaching. Please see individual programme pages for details.
Research (MPhil/PhD) programmes usually start in September, but may additionally start in the Winter (January) and Spring (April) terms at the discretion of your department. See below for more information.
The options are September (Autumn), January (Winter), or April (Summer).
All research courses accept applications for a September start. Only some departments accept students for January or April start dates. In general, starting in September is preferred. In your first year there are usually some taught elements, and starting in January or April may mean there are fewer options available.
Please read the information below carefully before applying.

The University of Edinburgh's academic staff are not only globally recognised experts in their own fields, but equally empathic mentors.
This programme focuses on the regulatory framework that governs information technology within international, European and domestic settings.
The programme is highly topical, exploring the second generation – and sometimes even third generation – of regulation that has evolved from the legal framework of the early 2000s. New developments in technology are also a key focus, as these force us to constantly review the very concept of information technology and appropriate legal responses.
Information technology regulation operates across jurisdictions, and a cross-fertilisation of regulatory responses occurs at the interface between domestic, regional and international law. Our aim is to enable you to understand this cross-fertilisation, to be able to contextualise it and place yourself within it.
Our online learning programmes are delivered entirely online via a virtual learning environment. Learning and teaching happen ‘asynchronously’. This means that you have the flexibility to log in at times and in places convenient to you, contribute your views and respond to others, and still maintain a sense of community with your fellow students across time zones.
To be awarded LLM Information Technology Law, you must successfully complete six courses, four of which must be core courses, and a 10,000-word dissertation during your chosen duration of study.
During your studies you will also have the opportunity to study up to two modules from different subject areas such as medical law or international commercial law.
Detailed information about the programme and your course options can be found online.
Please note the available choice of modules in any given year may change.

We link to the latest information available. Please note that this may be for a previous academic year and should be considered indicative.
By the end of your studies you should emerge with an understanding of information technology law not just in its legal but also its social, ethical, cultural and commercial contexts.
Graduates of our online distance learning programmes progress to a range of careers in Law and related legal fields, including work in local and international firms, government legal departments, other public institutions, international organisations and in academia.
The programmes are also an ideal platform for advanced research.

TUM offers over 100 master’s degree programs from a variety of fields. Find out here what master’s programs there are and how to apply.
What is a Master's Degree Program?
Master’s degree programs are graduate studies. That means, you have to complete an undergraduate degree to qualify, for example a bachelor’s degree program.
Depending on the program, TUM awards the following master’s degrees: Master of Science (M.Sc.), Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Education (M.Ed.) and Master of Science with honors (M.Sc. with honors). As a rule, students with master's degrees are entitled to pursue a doctorate.
If you have completed your studies outside of Germany and would now like to know what options you have with your degree with respect to master's degree programs in germany, the anabin-database can provide orientation.
What Master's Degree Programs are there?
A master's program can build on an undergraduate degree or it can be used to pursue a new field of study. In either case, these are referred to as consecutive master’s programs. Other master’s programs are particularly aimed at prospective students with professional experience. These are referred to as continuing education master’s programs. Contact the Student Advisory Office to learn how the TUM bachelor's programs align with the TUM master's programs or visit Master’s Day, which takes place annually.
Consecutive Master's Programs
Consecutive master’s programs are often structured on a bachelor's program of the same name. They are designed to deepen and expand the knowledge acquired during the undergraduate program. TUM offers at least one consecutive master's program for each bachelor's program.
Some master's programs are not structured on the basis of specific bachelor's programs. Instead, they can be pursued by students who hold bachelor's degrees from a range of different fields. While these programs require certain fundamental knowledge, this can be acquired through various bachelor's programs.
Example: TUM graduates with a Bachelor's in mechanical engineering can apply for a Master's in aerospace, mechanical engineering or robotics, cognition, intelligence, to name a few.
Continuing Education Master’s Programs
As a rule, continuing education master’s programs require candidates to have at least one year of work experience. In some cases, the programs may be attended while holding gainful employment. Duration of studies varies accordingly. Special tuition fees also apply.
Example: Students with a Bachelor's or undergraduate degree in electrical engineering and information technology have the option of pursuing continuing education master's programs like an Executive MBA.
TUM also offers double degree programs. Double degree programs give you the opportunity to receive a degree from both TUM and one of its partner universities.

Here you will find further information on double degree programs.
How does Aptitude Assessment work?
Master degree programs are subject to a two-step aptitude assessment procedure. Once an application has been received, the first step involves evaluating the application documents based on a point system. Depending on the number of points accumulated, candidates are then immediately accepted, rejected or invited to a selection interview. Some programs also use a written test instead of the selection interview. Consult the Academic and Examination Regulations of the desired program for further information regarding the required documentation and criteria.

Department guidance on using generative AI tools (ChatGPT)
Students are welcome to use generative AI tools to enhance their understanding of the material, identify sources, and to support their learning.
Students are permitted to make use of generative AI tools for the purposes of completing coursework assignments, unless specifically prohibited to do so in the relevant assignment brief.
All work submitted must be expressed in students’ own words, incorporating their own ideas and judgements. Any ideas, text, or computer code generated using generative AI tools, if included in students’ submissions, must be considered as originating from a third party and must thus be appropriately attributed and cited in line with best academic practice. Even in the case where generative AI tools have been utilised in the process of generating a document or presentation for the purposes of improving the readability, presentations, or language of a student’s original work, a notice of which tools were used, and for what purpose, should appear following the list of references in an appropriate section headed Use of Generative AI tools.
Guidance on how to appropriately reference generative AI tools as sources is available from the Library (under G for Generative AI). Further guidance on use of such tools, and common issues associated with their use, can be found here.
Failure to properly attribute the origin of 3rd party ideas presented in submitted work, whether from literature or an AI tool, constitutes plagiarism and will be prosecuted under the College’s Academic Misconduct Policy and Procedure.
To ensure academic standards are maintained, the department may choose to conduct ‘authenticity interviews’ on the students’ submitted assessments. This means asking the student to attend an oral examination on their submitted work to ensure its authenticity, by asking them about the subject or how they approached their assignment.
It should be noted that generative AI tools such, as ChatGPT, can provide relatively low-level text where, although it may appear to make sense, can miss the depth of understanding that is expected to be present in degree-level work, or even change your original text to something that is inaccurate. It is also prone to providing incorrect information.
Examples of referencing the use of generative AI tools
I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT 3.5 (OpenAI, to improve the text in my report. I confirm that no content generated by AI has been presented as my own work.

The university takes examination and assessment offences very seriously, and sets out the procedures for dealing with any such allegations in the King's Academic Manual, the Academic Misconduct Policy and the Academic Misconduct Procedures.
Academic Misconduct is the adoption of working methods that are outside the spirit of King's regulations and the values of academic integrity and any actions which interfere with the integrity and rigour of assessment undermine the University’s reputation and education standards.
The Academic Misconduct Policy provides extensive information on what constitutes academic misconduct and provides detailed guidance on the use of proofreading services and writing technologies like generative AI. Students are advised to spend time to familiarise themselves with the policy.
What happens with suspected misconduct?
Any instances of suspected misconduct will be reported by the relevant staff member(s) to the Student Conduct & Appeals Office.
I’m concerned about another student
If you see any unfair academic practice or have concerns about potential academic misconduct committed by another student, please contact Student Conduct & Appeals and your department in the first instance.
What is an Academic Integrity Meeting (AIM)?
Academic Integrity Meeting is the meeting convened at Stage One of the Academic Misconduct Procedure. Your department will invite you to an AIM if they have concerns about the work you have submitted.
AIM is not a hearing. During this meeting, you will be alerted to the problems/concerns identified with the work and will have the opportunity to respond.
You will receive further guidance regarding good academic practice, including best practice on referencing or other important academic skills. The department will also discuss with you if there are other academic or non-academic support needs that King's can facilitate to ensure your future works are up to standard and to maximise your academic success.
After the meeting you will receive notes of the discussion and a copy of the materials that were discussed in the meeting. If you forgot to mention something in the AIM, or have other information that you want the department to consider before making a decision on your case, you may submit that within 5 working days from the date of which you were sent the meeting notes.
Can I be accompanied or represented in the AIM?
You may be accompanied by:
- Another King’s community member, including a member/staff of KCLSU
- Friend or family member
Your accompanying person may advise and assist you during the meeting but you are expected to communicate with the department representatives directly.
The Chair will invite your KCLSU Representative to make representation on your behalf at the end of the meeting.
If I don't attend the AIM with my department, what will happen?
Academic Integrity Meetings are important academic meetings that you are expected to attend. If you are unable to attend, please inform the the department immediately, outlining the reason(s) why you can't attend. The department will determine whether the meeting can be postponed.
Important to know: If you are absent from the meeting without permission, your department may proceed in making a decision of your case based on the evidence that they have. The outcome is not invalidated due to your unauthorised absence, provided that you have been given timely written notice of the meeting.
What are the possible outcomes under Stage One AIM?
After the end of the 5-working days, the ASB Chair (or their nominee) will review all information available to them and decide one of the following outcomes:
- No cause of concern, work will be marked as usual
- The concerns relate to poor academic practice but not academic misconduct – work will be marked in line with the assessment criteria
- Academic misconduct has occurred and an outcome should be applied locally
- The case should be referred to Stage Two for further consideration.
What can I do if I am not happy with Stage One (AIM) outcome?
You can't contest the Department’s decision to refer your case to Stage Two of the Academic Misconduct Procedure, but you will have further opportunities to present your case at Stage Two.
If the department concludes after the AIM Meeting that academic misconduct has occurred and ordered one or more outcomes, you may contest the outcome within 10 working days from the date of the written notification of the Stage One AIM Outcome using the Contestation of Academic Integrity Meeting (AIM) Outcomes form.
You should elaborate clearing in the contestation form why you think the case warrants further review and provide supporting evidence of it. In accordance with the Academic Misconduct Policy, the case would only be referred to Stage Two for further consideration if Student Conduct & Appeals is satisfied that:
- There is new evidence or information of sufficient significance that the case warrants further review;
- That a significant procedural or administrative error occurred during the Stage One consideration and the case warrants further review;
- The Stage One outcome cannot reasonably be sustained by relevant guidance on assessment, academic integrity or penalties or
- There are other compelling reasons supported by independent evidence
A contestation is not an appeal but a rehearing. Your case will be considered again by an independent member who has no prior involvement in the case.
What happens in Stage Two of the Academic Misconduct Procedure?
All information, including what you have submitted to your department and information gathered by department will be reviewed by Student Conduct & Appeals who will determine the appropriate next steps. This could either be:
a) Referral to a Misconduct Committee Chair for a decision under the Expedited Procedure
In situations where facts are not contested, such as the student accepting full responsibility for their actions. A full hearing might not be necessary and the case may be referred to a Misconduct Committee Chair to make a decision under the expedited procedure stated in paragraph 7.23 of the Academic Misconduct Policy.
Do I have the opportunity to present my case?
Yes. If SCA considers your case is capable to be considered under this expedited procedure, they will write to you to provide you with the opportunity to provide further information or evidence to the Chair in writing within 5 working days, before a decision is made on paper.
Who is the Committee Chair?
Misconduct Committee Chairs are senior academic staff who have extensive experience in hearing cases on the Misconduct Committee and other student committees like appeal committees.
If your case is considered under this expedited procedure, one of the Committee Chairs who is not affiliated to your department and has no prior involvement in your case will be nominated to consider your case independently.
How will the Committee Chair make a decision?
Even if a full hearing is not convened, the Committee Chair will still read all documents and prepare for the case in the exact same way they prepare for a Committee Hearing. If there is anything that they want to seek a clarification, they will instruct SCA to contact you or the department.
In the consideration of the cases under this expedited procedure. The Chair is supported by student casework specialists in Student Conduct & Appeals who will provide procedural advice to ensure all decisions are made consistently.
Can I request my case to be heard in a full hearing instead?
Yes. If you prefer to have a full hearing, this can be requested in the same 5-working day period. Further instructions can be found in the letter that is sent to you via your King's e-mail.
b) Misconduct Committee
Where facts are in dispute or that the case is complex, your case could be referred to a Misconduct Committee directly. A full hearing will be convened:
- You will normally receive at least 10 days' notice and will be invited to present your case to the Committee. Details of the allegation and all documentary evidence will be sent along with the Hearing invitation.
- You can request reasonable adjustments and have a friend or family member present with you for support, though they won’t be able to speak on your behalf.
- An appropriate staff member will present the case against you, on behalf of the university.
- You will be able to speak on your own behalf, or have a member of the University or an appropriate KCLSU representative speak on your behalf.
- The Committee will determine whether the charge(s) of misconduct have been substantiated.
- Where the Committee concludes that the charge(s) is/are upheld, it may order one or more of the measures available to it under the Academic Regulations.
Following the Committee's findings, the university may refer the case to the faculty, or to a professional, statutory or regulatory body, in accordance with the Academic Regulations.
The decision of the Committee will normally be communicated to you and the examiners within 7 days of the decision.
For further guidance on Committee procedures please refer to our article What can I expect at an Appeal Committee hearing?
Is it possible to appeal against the outcome of a Misconduct Committee?
You may appeal against the findings or order(s) of a Misconduct Committee. If you would like to appeal, you must submit a Misconduct Appeal Form to Student Conduct & Appeals within 14 days of the written notification of the Misconduct Committee's decision.
Appeal Forms received after this deadline will only be accepted at the Discretion of the Principal. If are submitting your appeal out of the stipulated timeframe, you must explain the reasons of the delay and submit relevant supporting evidence to prove your circumstances.
In accordance with the Academic Regulations the grounds for a successful appeal are meeting one or all the following:
- That there is new evidence that could not have been, or for good reason was not, made available at the time of the hearing, and sufficient evidence remains that the appeal warrants further consideration;
- That evidence can be produced of significant procedural error on the part of the university before or during the hearing, and sufficient evidence remains that the appeal warrants further consideration;
- Any other grounds, including grounds of compassion;
The Principal will determine whether the criteria for an appeal have been met. If they determine the criteria for appeal have been met:
- An Appeal Committee will be convened; otherwise the appeal will be dismissed.
- This decision will normally be communicated within 30 working days of receipt of the appeal.
What happens if an Appeal Committee is convened?
- You will normally receive at least 10 working days' notice of the hearing, and will be invited to present your case to the Panel.
- You can request reasonable adjustments and have a friend or family member present with you for support, though they won’t be able to speak on your behalf.
- You will be able to speak on your own behalf, or have a member of the University or an appropriate KCLSU representative speak on your behalf.
- The Committee will determine whether there is sufficient reason to challenge the decision of the original Misconduct Committee.
- Where the Committee concludes such justification is present, they can modify or reverse the findings or order(s) of the Misconduct Committee.
- The decision of the Committee will normally be communicated to you and relevant staff within 5 working days of the decision.
For guidance on the Committee process, please refer back to What happens in the Misconduct Committee?
I'm not happy with the outcome; can I get an independent review of my case?
When all internal procedures are complete, if you are dissatisfied with final outcome; you can request an independent review of your case by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA). You must submit this request within one year of getting the final outcome letter from the University.
The Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA) is an independent body set up to review student complaints. It is free to students and deals with individual complaints against Higher Education Institutions in England and Wales.
Provided your complaint is eligible under the rules of the OIA’s complaints scheme, the OIA will look at whether King's has applied its regulations properly and followed its procedures correctly. It also considers whether any decision made by the King's was fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.

I really enjoyed my coursework and the professors – I found them extremely knowledgeable and very approachable. Having been away from university for a while, it didn’t take long for me to feel comfortable, thanks to their dedication to our intellectual wellbeing. With a strong community of students and the support of the professors, I absolutely relished the opportunity to devote myself to learning once more.
Offering students the opportunity to focus on two languages, in addition to English, the University of Edinburgh is the ideal place to study translation.
Our one-year, full-time taught Masters programme will enhance your practical skills in, and theoretical understanding of, translation as an activity. It can also be completed part-time over two years.
How you will learn
The programme combines:
- core courses
- optional courses
- research training
- practical translation
- a dissertation
It is taught through a combination of:
- seminars
- workshops
- tutorials
- student-led presentations (in option courses)
- written translation exercises
What you will gain
Across all our activities, we encourage critical thinking on language use and translation and an understanding of the factors which impact on the discipline. We will introduce you to key concepts in translation theory and show you how to apply them in translation practice.
This will help you sharpen important professional skills, such as:
- undertaking research
- thinking and writing analytically
- understanding texts in different genres and how to translate them

- developing oral and visual presentation techniques
- using a range of resources
The programme will also broaden your understanding of issues relating to translation, such as gender, institutional power relations, colonialism, and religion.
Languages
We offer a wide variety of languages, from Arabic to Norwegian, with the opportunity to focus on two of them, in addition to English.
You can browse the full range of languages offered, and find out about language pairs, on our website:
Community
A member of the RWS Campus-Trados Academic Partner Program, our MSc draws on the expertise of research-active teaching staff from across the School of Literatures, Languages and Cultures, as well as experts in Translation Studies and visiting speakers.
You will be part of an international community of students and a friendly, close-knit department with an excellent PhD programme, its own seminar series, and good links with the Institute of Translation and Interpreting (ITI), and with many industry and cultural partners in the city of Edinburgh.
We are an official Higher Education Language Partner of the Chartered Institute of Linguists (CIOL) and a member of APTIS (Association of Programmes in Translation and Interpreting Studies, UK and Ireland), which aims to improve the quality of translation and interpreting teaching in British and Irish universities. We also partner with IPCITI (The International Postgraduate Conference in Translation and Interpreting).
The University of Edinburgh library holds some two million borrowable volumes and subscribes to the 'Bibliography of Translation Studies'.
Translation and technology
We closely follow the developments in machine translation and generative AI, and how they might influence the teaching of translation. We also look to the language service industry and professional associations to understand how translators use AI and what opportunities and challenges these technologies might pose for linguists in the future.
Given the rapid technological development, the focus of our option course Technology and Translation in the Workplace has shifted over the past few years to include the field of machine translation.
The computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools we are using, for example, RWS Trados, now not only include translation memory systems, but also incorporate machine translation and other forms of automation as a standard component. In our classes, we examine the impact of these technologies on the workflow and on the role of the translator.
We continuously adapt our teaching to include discussions on technologies as they develop. For example, we also cover machine translation and generative AI in other courses, particularly in relation to creativity, translation practice and research methods, and ethical and legal issues (such as data usage or transparency).
Over the duration of the programme, you will take:
- two core courses
- two practical translation courses
- two optional courses
You will choose these from a wide range of subjects. Each course is worth 20 credits.
Core courses
The core courses are:
- Translation Studies 1, which introduces you to key concepts in translation theory and focuses on their application to translation practice
- Research in Translation Studies, which provides you with research skills specific to the discipline of translation studies and prepares you for your dissertation
The practical translation courses consist of tutor-led class time and workshops with Translation Studies staff per course, as well as an independent, peer-assessed study component. You will be supervised and assessed in practical translation exercises and graduate with a rich portfolio of translations.
Dissertation
The final element of the programme is your dissertation, a piece of independent research - 15,000 words (worth 60 credits) - written with the advice and support of a designated supervisor.
Upon successful completion of this programme you will:
- develop critical thinking on language use and translation as well as the use of translation technologies
- understand the key concepts of the academic discipline of translation studies
- learn to implement the diverse approaches to translation prevalent within translation studies in the form of various translation strategies
- broaden and deepen understanding of a variety of issues in relation to translation, such as gender, power relations, and religion
- acquire important transferable skills
Our programme is designed to enhance your industry skills in translation, with practical exercises throughout the year, and a strong emphasis on communication and working to deadline.
We have excellent links with the Institute of Translation and Interpreting (ITI) and are a member of the RWS Campus-Trados Academic Partner Program, providing students with the necessary knowledge, expertise and resources to help prepare for a career in the translation industry.
Completing our MSc will also help you develop and refine your research skills, and theoretical understanding of translation, in ways that will prepare you for further postgraduate study, should you wish to continue your career in an academic environment.
Many of our graduates have gone on to work as freelance and in-house translators, as well as project managers and language teachers. Others work within international companies, and some have continued into doctoral studies.

Anyone working in legal practice, academia, national, or international institutions, or corporations will need to engage with foreign laws and foreign legal concepts. The study of private law from a comparative perspective is therefore essential to those seeking a career in an international or transnational context.
Drawing on both the civil and common law tradition, the LLM in Comparative Private Law offers the ideal platform for you to develop expertise in core areas of private law from a comparative perspective, and to benefit from research-led teaching from legal scholars who are recognised as experts in their field.
It provides you with the opportunity to obtain an advanced qualification that is both academically rigorous and professionally beneficial.
This unique masters programme offers a wide range of subjects that deal with various aspects of private law from a comparative perspective, as well as courses on legal theory (such as 'Reasoning with Precedent' and Legal Decision Making) and legal history (such as 'Reasoning Using Civilian Authority').
Core courses cover the main areas of private law, including:
- Contract law
- Property law
- The law of trusts
- Delict and tort
- Family and child law
- International private law
In addition, you can select further courses from a broad list of options offered by the Law School, allowing you to tailor the LLM to meet your specific interests. Since 2018 this LLM programme offers two courses that focus on the comparative study of trust law. Those with a specific interest in studying trusts from a comparative perspective will therefore have a unique opportunity to specialise in this area.
Studying the Comparative and European Private Law LLM at Edinburgh certainly broadened my horizons, both in terms of personal experience and academic challenge.
Scotland is a mixed legal system meaning that its laws are shaped by both the civil law and the common law traditions. Edinburgh is therefore the perfect place to study private law from a comparative perspective. Edinburgh’s private lawyers work in a tradition that is outward-looking by its very nature, maintaining active research links with scholars in continental Europe and with the larger common law world beyond the United Kingdom.
The LLM in Comparative Private Law attracts an international community of talented and ambitious students from common law, civil law, and mixed legal jurisdictions from all over the world.
The programme provides you with an excellent foundation for a career in legal practice in national and transnational law firms or employment in international organisations. It also offers a strong basis for doctoral research in private law and the growing fields of Comparative Private Law, whether in the UK, in Europe, or beyond.
Graduates of this programme have pursued successful careers in all sectors of legal practice or have undertaken doctoral research in the UK or their home countries.
As an LLM student at Edinburgh Law School you'll not only benefit from expert teaching, but you will also be part of a vibrant intellectual community of legal academics and students.
Edinburgh Law School has a long-standing and very distinguished tradition of scholarship in the field of comparative private law. Private law has been taught and researched at the University of Edinburgh since 1722, and Edinburgh Law School is widely recognised as one of the leading institutions in the world in the field of Comparative Private Law.
Edinburgh Centre for Private Law
Closely associated with the LLM is the Edinburgh Centre for Private Law (ECPL) which was established in 2009. Much of the research carried out in the centre examines Private Law in a European and comparative context and fosters a lively dialogue between civilian and common law jurisdictions. Law reform is also strongly represented, with several members of the ECPL being current or former Law Commissioners.
Several members of the ECPL conduct research in various fields of private law, including contract law, unjustified enrichment, delict and tort, property law, trust law, succession law, family and child law not only in the Scottish context, but also in the comparative European and international, as well as historical, context. Their scholarly work has been as much concerned with the intellectual history of the law and the circulation of ideas across legal traditions as it has been with matters of legal doctrine.
The Edinburgh Centre for Private Law holds regular events featuring speakers from many different jurisdictions, which are attended by our LLM students. These events provide an excellent opportunity for students to meet legal scholars, legal practitioners, and judges interested in comparative and private law.
The centre also organises the annual W. A. Wilson Memorial Lecture.
The centre hosts several international academic visitors every year. It also has a separate Distinguished Visitorship in Private Law scheme. Former Distinguished Visitors include Professor Danie Visser (UCT South Africa) and Professor Lionel Smith (McGill University).
Other centres that you may want to get involved with are the Centre for Legal History, the Edinburgh Centre for Commercial Law, and the Edinburgh Centre for Legal Theory.

You can select between 80 and 120 credits of the following courses:
Child Law in Comparative Perspectives (20 credits)
This course aims to examine child law from a comparative perspective by looking at the status of children and children’s legal rights from a range of jurisdictions, such as Scotland, England, United States, Australia and New Zealand. You will also be encouraged to share research from your home jurisdictions, where different.
The course will identify common child law issues that will provoke discussion, challenge previously-held views and encourage reading and research to find common ground and establish ways to pursue equality, whilst respecting cultural and religious backgrounds.
The issues to be addressed will include: the legal definition of “child”; welfare vs protection; evolving capacity of a child; state intervention; criminal responsibility; UNCRC; and religious and cultural parative and International Trust Law (20 credits)
This course explores the essential nature of trusts, as well as their core features, by examining different conceptual approaches that are taken to trusts across selected jurisdictions in common law. It explores the essential nature of trusts, as well as their core features, by examining different conceptual approaches that are taken to trusts across selected jurisdictions in common law, civil law and mixed legal jurisdictions. In doing so it shows the flexibility and diversity of the concept and how different models of trusts have circulated over time and space.
The course further examines the values underpinning certain regulatory choices across a number of jurisdictions as well as the boundaries of trust law and what is and what is not permitted across jurisdiction. In addition to examining trusts in the doctrinal context of specific legal systems, the course also considers trusts in a conflict of laws perspective.
The course examines the notion of 'trust' from a functional perspective. It is not limited to any particular system of 'trust law' and, in particular, it is not a course devoted to the 'common law trust' only, being international and comparative in its approach. The trust jurisdictions considered usually include England and Wales, the United States of America, New Zealand, selected offshore jurisdictions, mixed legal systems (such as Scotland, South Africa and Quebec) and civil law systems, including, for instance, Germany, France and Italy. Alongside selected mainstream trust jurisdictions, this course also considers European harmonisation projects, and other international trust parative Property Law (20 credits)
This is an advanced level course on the law of property. It will examine the treatment of key areas within this subject, in particular ownership and limited real rights. Both movable and immovable property will be considered. The approach adopted will be comparative and reference will be made throughout to other jurisdictions. This will include continental Europe and the USA as well as other mixed legal systems such as Louisiana and South Africa. Fundamental conceptual structures will be compared, as well as specific problems, with a view to illuminating not only differences but also the common features of those systems. Recent initiatives to harmonise property law in Europe will be considered, in particular the Draft Common Frame of Reference.
The course is designed mainly for those students who have already studied the law of property in their own system. Those who have not may still apply for a place in the course, but they should be aware that additional study may be parative Statutory Interpretation (20 credits)
Legislation is the principal source of new law in most jurisdictions. This course will examine where legislation comes from and how it is construed and interpreted in practice (both inside and outside the courts) in anglo-american legal systems. This advanced level course will consider drafting of legislation, and take a detailed look at approaches to the interpretation of statutes in theory and in practice from a comparative perspective.
Contract Law in Europe (20 credits)
This course is a comparative contract law course. Its main focus is fundamental concepts of the law of contract, which arise in all systems. The course compares national systems of contract law, principally Scots, English, French and German law. The course also considers some of the harmonisation initiatives that have taken place in Europe over the last decade, principally the Draft Common Frame of Reference (Principles, Definitions and Model Rules of European Private Law).
Delict and Tort (20 credits)
This is an advanced level course on the law of delict. It will examine the treatment of key areas of liability in Scots and English law. The approach adopted will be comparative and reference will be made throughout to other Anglo-American and European legal systems. Fundamental conceptual structures will be compared, as well as specific problems, with a view to illuminating not only differences but also the common features of those systems. Particular attention will be given to the impact of Human Rights law on the law of delict and current debates on the extent of the constitutionalisation of private law. Recent initiatives to establish a common European law of torts will also be discussed.
The course is designed mainly for those students who have already studied the law of obligations in their own system. Those who have not may still apply for a place in the course, but they should be aware that additional study may be required.
Students require an undergraduate degree in law to study this course.
This course is particularly suitable for students who have already studied delict/tort in reasonable depth at undergraduate level and who wish to pursue their interest further in comparative perspective.Fundamentals of Comparative Private Law (20 credits)
The aim of this course is to provide students with a general introduction to the basics of the comparative study of law, and to equip them with the tools necessary to conduct comparative analysis with a particular focus on private law. Attention will be given to different methodological approaches to the comparative enquiry, and to the purposes and challenges of the legal comparison. The course will also assess the taxonomical debates in comparative legal scholarship through the lens of the main sources of law. This course thus offers an ideal foundation for students who want to study core areas of private law across both civil and common law jurisdictions. It further offers an ideal preparation for students who aim to write a dissertation that is based on a comparative inquiry or that contains a comparative angle.
The course is structured in two parts. Part one of the course engages with the aims of the comparative inquiry and explores various methodological approaches placing emphasis on both theory and practical applications. Part two introduces students to the taxonomical debates, the main sources of law in both the common and civil law traditions. It thus allows students to gain an understanding of what can and should be compared, as well as of the challenges and potential pitfalls of the comparative enquiry.Reasoning with Precedent (20 credits)
This course examines the practice of justifying legal claims and conclusions by reference to precedent. It combines case law analysis and jurisprudential discussion. You will discuss actual judicial opinions identifying how precedent is used in legal argument and familiarise yourself and engage critically with the relevant jurisprudential literature on the subject.
You will have the option to take between 0 and 40 credits of courses from different subject areas offered by the Law School, depending on availability and with the express permission of the programme director. Depending on demand, space on courses outside the core courses may be limited.
Full programme details, including core and optional courses is available on the University Degree Regulations and Programmes of Study website.

Having successfully completed 120 credit points of courses within the LLM, you will be ready to move onto a single piece of independent and in-depth research. The 10,000 word dissertation allows you to focus on a preferred topic from within the field of comparative and European private law, normally based on a subject you have studied in one of your courses during the programme.
You will be assigned an academic dissertation supervisor who will provide you with support and guidance while you prepare and write your dissertation.
The dissertation is a challenging but rewarding endeavour, asking you to demonstrate a comprehensive grasp of the relevant literature and an ability to engage critically with a range of sources, drawing on the skills and knowledge you have developed during the course of the programme. Students are encouraged to show originality and evidence of independent thinking, whether in terms of the material used, or the manner in which it is presented.
The dissertation is written in the summer months (April to August) after the taught courses are successfully completed.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.

Find out what it's like to study for an LLM in Comparative and European Private Law at Edinburgh Law School from our former students.
Henrik studied the LLM in Comparative and European Private Law in the academic year 2023-24, graduating in 2024.
""After several years of studying law in Germany, I wanted to study foreign law as well. The LL.M. programme in Comparative Private Law has exceeded this goal by giving me a better understanding not only of other, but also of my own legal system as well as of the law in general: by exposing biases and (false) assumptions and by broadening my understanding of what the law is, how it operates and what it can and should do.
There are probably few places in the world better suited for the study of comparative private law than Edinburgh. With roots in both the civil and common law traditions, Scottish law naturally draws inspiration from both, and Edinburgh Law School, with its long tradition of comparative legal scholarship, is therefore the perfect place for research in this area.
For me, the strength of the programme lies not only in its wide range of specialised courses and other events that allow for in-depth discussions, but also in its inspiring teaching staff who understand both the potential and the challenges of comparative methods in law. In addition, the small but diverse group of highly qualified students in the programme brought together perspectives from around the world while at the same time creating a strong sense of community.
Beyond Old College, the home of the Law School, Edinburgh has much to offer as well and is a wonderful place to live, which made the programme not only academically but also personally an invaluable experience for me.""
Tim is studying the LLM in Comparative and European Private Law in the 2022-23 academic year. In this video he talks about his experience of studying for an LLM at Edinburgh Law School and life in Edinburgh.
Julia studied the LLM in Comparative and European Private Law in 2021-22, graduating in 2022.
Comparative Law triggered an interest in me because of the intellectual puzzles involved, and the way in which it reveals further truths about culture and society.
The LLM at Edinburgh delivered on both fronts, and where better to do it, in the ‘mixed’ jurisdiction of Scotland, a combination of ‘civil’ and ‘common’ law; terms you will become all too familiar with.
During my time at Edinburgh I was challenged with questions like, ‘Can a Trust be transplanted to other jurisdictions?’ and debated the real difference between civil and common law. This experience was only enriched further by the fact that many of my classes were truly international, with myself often being the only participant from the UK.
What was also important to me was to experience something different. As a short year programme, it provides a unique opportunity to explore somewhere new. I can now proudly navigate the Scottish capital without the assistance of google maps, and have made friends from all around the world. Edinburgh has a variety which is hard to match; historical but also modern, trips away easily to the beach and Glasgow, as well as numerous excellent art galleries and theatre productions.
Federico, a lawyer from Uruguay, studied the LLM in Comparative and European Private Law in the 2019/20 academic year, graduating in 2020. In this video he talks about his experience of studying for an LLM at Edinburgh Law School, life in Edinburgh, completing his studies during the Covid-19 pandemic and how the LLM has helped him in his career.
Céline studied the LLM in Comparative and European Private Law in the 2018-19 academic year. In this video she talks about her experiences on the programme and life in Edinburgh.
Thomas studied the LLM in Comparative and European Private Law in 2018-19, graduating in 2019. He is currently doing a PhD at the University of Bayreuth (Germany).
My time in Edinburgh has been highly enriching and full of valuable experiences which I know will stand me in good stead moving forward. After studying law in Germany for five years, I wanted to go beyond the German legal system and learn about others. I wanted to look at legal systems from a theoretical standpoint and to be able to identify broader trends and by doing so reflect differently about the law in my home jurisdiction.
Edinburgh is the perfect place to study comparative law. The Scottish jurisdiction combines aspects of both common and civil law, including those perceived common law traditions such as the trust in their civil law based property law. Once you see that such combinations are possible you start to confront and question your own assumptions that you came with. This is a helpful process regardless of whether you work or conduct research in a comparative law environment or any other area of law. I am therefore very grateful that the LLM not only met, but exceeded my expectations.
The teaching is led by scholars who are deeply involved in comparative law and you often come across their papers and have the opportunity to discuss them during the seminars. Some of the professors have also been involved in international comparative and harmonisation projects and are able to provide first-hand insight. As a comparative law student, I was also invited to research seminars at the Edinburgh Centre of Private Law where students can meet and learn from international and distinguished scholars.

Academic publishing between Copyright, Creative Commons and Open Access (PGR)
Publishing your work and sharing your findings is a key component of a successful research career. In the last years publishing open access became a (research funder) requirement and a (publisher) expectation. In this rapidly changing landscape, it is very easy to get confused between Green and Gold or Bronze and Platinum Open Access publishing models. Add on top some Creative Commons licenses and the confusion is complete. This workshop is designed to explain the relationship between copyright, Creative Commons licenses and Open Access and how authors can navigate the publishing process meeting all their funder’s requirements, ensuring maximum impact and visibility of their research while not breaking the law (nor the bank).
At the end of this workshop participants will have:
• a clear overview of the publishing models;
• an understanding of open access, creative commons licenses and copyright and how this applies to scholarly communications;
• an understanding of what is required of authors
This workshop relates to domains C1, D2 and D3 of the RDF.

Advanced Presentation Skills Masterclass
***This workshop is only open to participants who have attended the Voice and Presentation Skills Workshop***
Whether you speak in public regularly or only occasionally, without expert feedback and advice, it’s difficult to know how your presentations are landing with your audience and what you can do to make them even better. Knowing what to say and how to present are essential, but only by understanding the skill of delivery will you have the greatest impact; therefore, this workshop is designed to help you practice and develop your skills. This workshop will focus on the presentation design, structure, style and delivery and not the content of your presentation.
In this practical and interactive session, you will have the opportunity to deliver a pre-prepared presentation in a relaxed and supportive environment. You’ll then review it, deconstruct it and identify opportunities for improvement with the support of the facilitator, Communication Specialist and Award-winning Speaker, Mel Sherwood.
By the end of the training, you will increase your confidence and enhance your own natural presentation style to ensure your audience is engaged and your message is remembered.
Learning outcomes
After attending this workshop you will be able to:
1. Build confidence and belief in your own unique presentation style
2. Use engagement techniques to capture and hold the attention of your audience
3. Open and close your presentation with impact
4. Be fully relaxed, present and in the moment when speaking in public
5. Enhance your body language and vocal expression using subtle yet powerful verbal and non-verbal communication techniques
6. Incorporate props and effectively use visual aids to ensure your message is memorable (for all the right reasons!)
This workshop will be held in person and class size is limited to ensure everyone gets the required support. As this is an advanced course, participants must have completed the Voice and Presentation Skills Workshop before attending this workshop. This workshop is ideally suited to anyone who will be delivering a research presentation in the next 6 months (e.g a conference presentation)
Please note that there is pre course work for this masterclass. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire to ensure the session content can be tailored as much as possible to address your particular requirements. You will also be asked to prepare a 5 minute presentation to be delivered on the day; the topic can be anything you like. Your presentation may be filmed during the session.
Workshop Facilitator: Mel Sherwood
Please note: This workshop is also open to Research Staff, however booking is only available via the People & Money Learning App. Please book a place via the People and Money Learning App. More information and details on how to book can be found here:

Afternoon Writing Retreat
The aim of a structured writing retreat is to use dedicated writing time to progress writing projects in a supportive environment. Example projects include, book chapters, journal articles, research proposals and reports.
Most of the time is used for writing, with everyone logged into the online session working on their own projects. This is not a writing workshop, but just gives participants space and time to write. Participants should come to the session with an idea of what they are going to be working on.
A retreat works best when you focus exclusively on writing, defining specific goals you want to achieve i.e. sections of a paper/chapter, number of words, etc.
This 1-minute video covers what the retreat session will, and won't involve: 
This Afternoon writing retreat will be held online via Microsft Teams or on campus. See schedule for details.

BANish - Big Audience Nervousness
As a researcher you’ve presented your work to your group and to your departmental peers. And it was no big deal. You handled it calmly and professionally. But now you’ve been accepted to give a talk at that big prestigious conference. Or you’ve been given a chance to present your research pitch in a large regional or national competition.
You imagine a large sea of faces in front of you.
And the Big Audience Nerves kick in.
Of course, the secret to success here is practice – but Big Audience events are not things that occur every day – so opportunities to practice are comparatively rare. However, in this session we’ll focus on how to BANish your Big Audience Nerves.
Together we’ll explore some tactics to
• Be at your best in front of a large room of people
• Accept what you can and can’t control and so regulate your speech and behaviour
• Nullify the downsides of nerves while harnessing the energy that adrenaline can provide
(This session builds on the themes and ideas explored in Presenting for the Terrified).

Habits and Tools for Effective Writing
Many researchers struggle with the strategies of academic writing, both with regard to writing techniques and to writing habits. Moreover, many junior scholars sometimes need a little help with editing and targeting their outputs. These focused webinars (with a small amount of pre-thinking and some work between the sessions) will provide you with a toolkit to help you to:
- Identify 'good' academic prose and consider the techniques of creating 'good' writing
- Deconstruct the mechanics of effective prose
- Develop a process for conceptualising and planning writing
- Create writing habits that ensure you actually write Recognize prose traps and edit your work more effectively
- Understand how to target your efforts so they’re more likely to be editor, and thus publication, friendly.
We can’t guarantee that your research findings will be high-impact, but we can work together to help you understand how to convey your findings in a clear, succinct and scholarly way. After all, your research efforts count for very little unless you write...

The Association represents the interests of all LSE alumni and helps to strengthen relationships between alumni, between alumni and the School and between the School and alumni – by providing advice on alumni engagement programming, and supporting the broader objectives of LSE in engaging its international alumni community in a reciprocal relationship.
The Alumni Association is governed by an Alumni Association Constitution and guided by a set of Byelaws, and steered by the Global Alumni Board comprised of 12 members.
Global Alumni Board volunteer members are all alumni of the School. The composition of the Board volunteers reflects LSE's global community, and alumni volunteer members represent and advocate for all alumni in partnership with LSE, via interaction with the School’s Philanthropy and Global Engagement division (PAGE). All Alumni Association positions are unpaid volunteering positions. All Board volunteer members are elected based on their interest, specialism and ability to fulfil specific roles. They are joined by ex-officio members of LSE staff from PAGE division.
The Global Alumni Board is set up to:
- Promote the voice and views of alumni so they are heard by the School
- Suggest: (i) how alumni can best contribute to the School and the Association, (ii) what the School should do to ensure the best contribution from alumni, and (iii) how best to recognise that alumni contribution
- Facilitate cooperation between the Association and LSE Philanthropy & Global Engagement Division to strengthen the School's Alumni Engagement programme, by improving current initiatives and developing new ones
- Ensure that the Association is appropriately structured and organised, with regard to the needs of both the School and alumni.

Reiterating the commitment expressed in the First, Second, Third and Fourth Oxford Statements to clarify rules of international law applicable in the use of information and communications technologies;
Noting that ransomware (i.e. malware designed to encrypt data and render it unavailable unless a demand is met) is a global threat, having been employed at an escalating pace by a growing number of malicious actors, including states and non-state groups for financial or political purposes, often connected to criminal and other unlawful activities such as terrorism, human and drug trafficking, money laundering, sanctions evasion, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction;
Stressing that the COVID-19 pandemic and our increased dependency on the Internet and other information and communications technologies have enhanced vulnerabilities to and opportunities for ransomware and other types of malware that facilitate its distribution, including the targeting of remote control or monitoring systems and the use of phishing emails, malicious websites or false notifications;
Considering that ransomware has, in the vast majority of cases where it has been employed, caused significant and widespread harm to public and private institutions, as well as individuals, such as financial loss, reputational damage, breach of confidentiality, and the significant disruption of critical infrastructure, including healthcare and education, while posing an imminent risk of destructive harm to industrial control systems such as electric grids, water distribution systems and nuclear power plants;
Bearing in mind that ransomware can take increasingly varied and sophisticated forms, including targeted and indiscriminate operations, and lead to the denial of access to and/or the unauthorized release of data if demands are not met;
We agree that:
1. Conduct carried out through information and communications technologies, such as ransomware operations, is regulated by international law.
2. States must refrain from conducting, directing, authorising or aiding and assisting ransomware operations which violate the principles of sovereignty or non-intervention in a state’s internal or external affairs, or amount to a prohibited threat or use of force within the meaning of the Charter of the United Nations. In particular, states must refrain from ransomware operations which are aimed at or result in disruption to electoral systems, healthcare, electric grids, water distribution systems, and nuclear power plants.
3. States must refrain from conducting, directing, authorising or aiding and assisting ransomware operations that result in violations of the human rights of individuals within their jurisdiction, such as the right to life, health, private life, education, property, freedoms of thought and opinion, freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds.
4. a) States must not allow their territory or infrastructure under their jurisdiction or control to be used by states or non-state actors for ransomware operations that are contrary to the rights of other states, when the former states know or should know of such operations.
b) To discharge those duties, states from which ransomware operation emanates, in full or in part, must take feasible measures to stop such operations and otherwise address the situation. Such measures may include the conduct of investigations, the adoption of legal and technical measures, as well as cooperation with other states. Any measures taken in this regard must be compliant with applicable obligations under international law, including international human rights law.
5. States must take measures to protect the human rights of individuals within their jurisdiction from harmful ransomware operations, including when such operations are carried out by other states and non-state actors. To discharge this obligation, states may, among other measures, prohibit ransomware by law, take feasible steps to stop ransomware operations, mitigate their effects, investigate and punish those responsible, as well as prevent and suppress ransom payments to the extent possible. Where such protective measures interfere with other human rights, they must conform with applicable legal requirements, such as legitimate purpose, legality, necessity, proportionality and non-discrimination.
6. The use of ransomware during armed conflict is subject to the applicable rules of international humanitarian law (IHL). These rules include, but are not limited to, the duty to respect and ensure respect for IHL, which entails an obligation to prevent violations of IHL; the duties to respect and to protect specific actors or objects, including medical personnel and facilities and humanitarian personnel and consignments; the duties concerning objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population as well as those concerning works and installations containing dangerous forces; and other rules on the protection of civilians, civilian objects, and of persons who no longer participate in hostilities, such as the sick, wounded, and prisoners of war.
7. The use of ransomware will amount to international crimes, such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, where the elements of those crimes are fulfilled.
8. The application of the aforementioned rules is without prejudice to any other applicable rules of international law that provide protections against ransomware and related activities.

Introduction
This LLM provides the highest quality of teaching by leading international and UK academics. It combines views and experiences from different disciplinary traditions and jurisdictions, ensuring that what you learn is relevant to legal study and practice.
Courses are offered across a broad range of fields, including: arbitration; human rights; international law; corporate; commercial; and financial law.
You can choose to pursue your LLM with a general focus, or pursue a subject specialism. If you take the required number of LLM courses (or more), you can request that your chosen specialism is included on your final certificate.
Should your dissertation topic directly correlate with your nominated specialism, the compulsory Legal Research and Writing Skills course can make up part of your programme if this is agreed by the LSE Law School. Furthermore, with the relevant approval, and subject to space, you may be able to take up to a full unit course, or two half-unit courses from another LSE department.
The specialisms for 2024/25 are:
- Competition and Innovation
- Corporate and Commercial Law
- Criminal Law and Justice
- Dispute Resolution
- Environment and Energy Law
- European, Comparative and Transnational Law
- Financial Law and Regulation
- Human Rights Law
- Intellectual Property Law
- International Business Law
- IT and Data Law
- Law, Politics and Social Change
- Public International Law
- Public Law
- Taxation Law
Graduates with a legal qualification from their home jurisdictions may be eligible to join a variety of employers in financial and management consulting, subject to re-qualification and visa requirements. Others may continue to progress their careers in national, regional and international law firms, or work in a legal capacity within an NGO or multilateral organisation.
Entry requirements
A very good undergraduate degree in law, LLB or equivalent, (for example, a first or very high upper second in the UK LLB or equivalent).
Applicants with a very good degree in another discipline together with very good grades in an appropriate graduate diploma in law (such as the UK's Graduate Diploma in Law) may also qualify for a place.
Applicants without an educational background in law may apply, but would need to demonstrate a high level of professional or academic experience in areas closely related to the subjects they wish to study in order to be considered for a place.
Please select your country from the dropdown list below to find out the entry requirements that apply to you.
Overseas
English language requirements
The English language requirement for this programme is Law. Read more about our English language requirements.
Competition for places at LSE is strong. So, even if you meet the minimum entry requirements, this does not guarantee you an offer of a place.
However, please don’t feel deterred from applying – we want to hear from all suitably qualified students. Think carefully about how you can put together the strongest possible application to help you stand out from other students.
Programme content
This programme is available full-time or part-time. Part-time LLM students take four half-unit courses each year, attending the same sessions as full-time students. Students may also register on an extended part-time basis, taking two half-unit courses each year, and bringing the total duration of the programme to 48 months.
You'll take the compulsory course Legal Research and Writing Skills, which is assessed by a 10,000-word dissertation. You'll then select seven LLM courses from the large range on offer, usually around 80.
As noted above, subject to taking the required minimum number of LLM courses (or more) in one of the available specialisms, you can request that your chosen specialism is listed on your final certificate upon graduation, or alternatively your LLM can have a more general focus. The compulsory Legal Research and Writing Skills course can make up a nominated specialism if the topic directly relates to the area of study and upon agreement by the Law School. Furthermore, with the relevant approval and subject to space on your desired course, you may be able to substitute the equivalent of up to two half-unit LLM courses for course/s from another LSE department.

Learning and assessment
How you learn
How you're assessed
All taught courses are required to include formative coursework which allows the teacher to give you feedback but which is unassessed, in the sense that it doesn't count towards your final grade. Formative coursework is designed to help prepare you for summative assessment which counts towards the course mark and to the degree award. LSE uses a range of types of formative assessment, such as essays, problem sets, case studies, reports, quizzes, mock exams, class presentations and many others. Summative assessment may be conducted during the course or by final examination at the end of the course. An indication of the formative coursework and summative assessment for each course can be found in the relevant course guide.
The majority of taught LLM courses will be assessed by written two-hour examinations, which will be held during Spring Term in May/June. Summative essays are submitted in May and dissertations in August. To prepare for the exams, you will have access to past exam papers from our library website and you will undertake appropriate formative coursework.
The compulsory course is assessed via a 10,000-word dissertation on a topic of your choice and will be supervised by one of our faculty members who is an expert in the relevant area.
Graduate destinations

Funding opportunities
Programme website: Global Environment and Climate Change Law
Environmental law is a dynamic, fast-developing and globally important area of law that requires not only specialist legal knowledge but also an understanding of underpinning political, economic and scientific issues.
This programme is designed to equip you with an advanced, multidisciplinary knowledge of the legal issues and techniques related to environmental protection, with special emphases on climate change and the marine environment.
You will analyse and evaluate the historic and ongoing development of international, European and national law for environmental protection, the interrelations between these different levels of law-making and the interactions between environmental law and other areas of law. You may also have the opportunity to take environment-related courses from other University of Edinburgh schools, including the School of Social and Political Science and the School of GeoSciences, and Edinburgh University Business School.
You must complete 180 credits of study – 60 credits are taken in the compulsory dissertation and the remaining 120 credits are taken in taught courses.
You will experience a range of teaching styles on these courses, led by members of Edinburgh Law School academic community and experienced legal and industry practitioners.
You are expected to prepare in advance by reading the required materials and by reflecting on the issues to be discussed, and your participation in classes will be assessed.
For the dissertation you will have a supervisor from whom you can expect guidance and support, but the purpose of the dissertation is to allow you to independently design and conduct a piece of research and analysis.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.
By the end of the programme, students will have acquired an in-depth understanding of concepts, innovations and challenges characterising the law on environmental protection, natural resource management and responses to climate change, at the international, European and national level.
Students will also develop the critical skills necessary to carry out independent analysis of the activity of international and supranational legal and political institutions, national governments and domestic courts, NGOs and the private sector in this field.
Openness to different scholarly approaches within law will be encouraged, by offering the opportunity to complement specialised law courses with courses offered by the School of Social and Political Science, the Business School and the School of Geosciences addressing questions related to the scientific and socio-economic aspects of environmental protection.
The programme is suitable to prepare students for the increasingly broad range of specialised job opportunities offered at the national and international level by the public and private sector, as well as for advanced research.
The Global Environment & Climate Change Law programme is a gateway to graduates finding careers as specialised legal drafters, government advisers, international negotiators, legal advisers to private companies and NGOs, international civil servants, specialised researchers in academic and think-tank institutions and independent consultants.
The University of Edinburgh's Careers Service offers support to students to identify internship opportunities in international and non-governmental organisations, academia and think-tanks. Recent graduates are now working in legal roles internationally, including in India, Mexico and the Netherlands, and for the European Commission.
These entry requirements are for the 2025/26 academic year and requirements for future academic years may differ. Entry requirements for the 2026/27 academic year will be published on 1 Oct 2025.

To achieve our aims, we carry out a diverse range of activities which are organised under four main areas: research, teaching, events and public service.
Most of our activities are carried out through collaborations with partners both within King’s College London and outside, including academic institutions, think tanks, non-governmental organisations and other civil society actors. Check our activity and events pages for more info.

Leading the way for our students
The Institute started with a gift from Sir Dickson Poon, who asked us to create a world-leading centre for transnational law. We’ve worked hard to fulfil that ambition and have grown to become a renowned centre and host to some of the world’s leading experts on a wide range of transnational law subjects.
We were the first university to offer the LLM with a transnational law pathway.

A short-term approach
This guidance is intended to provide direction and support for staff in making changes to their assessment approaches in the light of advances in generative AI, and its implications for assessment as evidence of learning.
The page is divided into three sections looking at three approaches to examining assessment and AI.
This is a short-term approach, where you have identified vulnerabilities in your assessments and major changes would require a radical rethink unfeasible in the timeframe of this academic year.
This is a mid to longer-term approach, where students are encouraged to use generative AI tools in summative assessment tasks, formative activities and as part of a feedback literacy strategy.
This may be a mid to longer term approach, depending on your context. Approaches to assessment are reconsidered, where the vulnerabilities of traditional assessment to generative AI is a catalyst for facilitating Assessment for Learning.

or by either a TOEFL total score of at least 80 points (iBT) or an academic IELTS overall band score of 6.5 points. (A screenshot or scan of the test result is sufficient as long as it is clearly identifiable to be yours). If you are not able to provide your TOEFL/IELTS score at the time of application you may upload an informal petition instead via our online-tool, saying that you are going to hand in your result after the application deadline via email. (Deadline: August 31st).
All Applicants from EU and non-EU countries must in addition to their application at our department apply at the University’s International Office (Referat für internationale Angelegenheiten) which assesses whether you fulfill the formal requirements for admission to the university itself.
It is recommended to prepare your application to the University's International Office simultaneously with your application for the master programn at the department of Economics. The application period of the International Office officially begins Mid-May but you can send in your application already at the beginning of May. It ends on July 15 for intake in the winter semester. Please apply as early as possible, otherwise the timeframe may get tight to obtain a visa or prepare your move before the semester starts. It is important to know that you can apply at the International Office already before you have received the ""Certificate of Suitability"" (""Eignungsbescheid"") for the master program from our department, that means you do not need to provide the ""Certificate of Suitability"" for the Master in Economics at the time of your application to the International Office but you can hand it in later when you have received admission from both the International Office and the master program and enroll in person at the International Office (usually in October).
We recommended to send applications to the International Office by registered letter or a courier service to have a proof of the delivery. Applicants will be notified by email about successful admission to the University.
Please adhere to all the guidelines for application to the International Office described on their website (see section ""Full time students (degree students)"" --> ""Application, admission and registration""). You can contact the International Office directly via the email address: zulassung.international@.
Also please note:
- during the evaluation period the International Office is closed and cannot be contacted.
- You do not have to provide proof of German language proficiency for our master program. The entire program is taught in English. Due to the fact that the admission requirements for the application at the International Office relate also to other master programs being taught in German, the general application form requests this information.
If your application is successful, you can register for the Master’s Program in Economics by presenting the Certificate of Suitability (""Eignungsbescheid"") you received from our department together with all other required documents at the Student's Registry (Studentenkanzlei). Please find the registration deadlines under the section ""Postgraduale (u.a. Master) und Promotionsstudiengänge"".
Foreign applicants who have received admission both to the master program and to the university have to enroll at the International Office (Referat Internationale Angelegenheiten) with the Certificate of Suitability (""Eignungsbescheid"" from our Department (i.e. the admission to the Master's program) as well as the letter of admission received from the International Office (i.e. the admission to the University). The registration deadline will be indicated in the letter of admission, which you will receive from the International Office.
Enrollment is only possible with your final degree certificate. If you are not able to present a final degree certificate up to the official enrollment dates, you will have the possibility of retroactive enrollment. Please ask for more information regarding late enrollment at the Students Registry (Studentenkanzlei) or the International Office.
The Online Application Tool for the Master in Economics will be available only within the application period from April 1st to April 30th every year.
In order to apply for entry into the Master in Economics program starting in October every year, you will have to upload your documents via the online application tool which will be available here from April 1st to April 30th. Please note that we do not accept any documents send to us via email or mail. After you have successfully created an account in the application tool you will receive an application number. Please don't forget to use it for your correspondence with the MGSE Master’s Office.
Please make sure that you upload all required documents and information until the end of the application period, otherwise your application can not be regarded as successfully submitted. All relevant pages of the respective document should be scanned and saved as one pdf-file (maximum size: 5 MB) to be uploaded in our tool. We can only take into consideration the required documents which are listed on our homepage, so please don't provide any recommendations or reference letters, internship certificates, etc. If you are not able to provide your TOEFl/IELTS test result in time you can upload a short note to explain the delayed submission instead and send a scan or screenshot after the application period via email to mgse-master@ (deadline August 31st).
The motivation letter (about 2,000 to 3,000 characters including spaces) has to be inserted as an unformatted text without using control characters, indentations or other special symbols in the provided text field.
You will receive an automatically issued e-mail as acknowledgement of receipt for your application. Only a copy of this e-mail will be accepted as proof that you successfully submitted your application.
Please note the following technical information:
- Some internet-browsers block verification signs (shown at the end of the registration site). Your browser will ask whether ""insecure elements"" should be loaded (maybe you will just see a shield icon appearing in the address bar) - you should enable your browser to process and will then see the verification sign.

Whisker-Inspired Tactile Sensor and Biomimetic Rodent Robot
We aim to design and fabricate a whisker-inspired tactile sensor to enable exteroceptive sensing for a biomimetic mouse robot. Owing to its mechanical flexibility and low computational cost, the whisker sensor is ideally suited for assisting the biomimetic mouse robot in navigating confined, poorly lit, and unstructured environments.

The University of Edinburgh's world-class LLM in Medical Law and Ethics helped me grow tremendously as a lawyer and personally.
This programme draws on the expertise and tradition of Edinburgh to deliver an internationally-focused, interdisciplinary programme that combines flexible learning with the most up-to-date teaching on all of the important issues affecting medicine, law and ethics today.
Medical law is a fascinating field of study as advances in medical research and new technologies shift the boundaries of medicine. New health issues are emerging and patient rights are increasingly taking centre stage. New and complex medico-legal dilemmas arise in clinical practice, in the realities of human health, and in the relationships between patients and healthcare professionals.
The programme enables you to explore the international and interdisciplinary dimensions of medical law and ethics. You will have opportunities to examine healthcare policy and the regulation of medicine in different parts of the world. You will also evaluate responses to technology and debate possible futures for medical law.
Applications are welcomed from legal professionals and healthcare professionals, including doctors and nurses, and from all those with an interest in this area.
Our online learning programmes are delivered entirely online via a virtual learning environment. Learning and teaching takes place ‘asynchronously’. This means that you have the flexibility to log in at times and in places convenient to you, contribute your views and respond to others, and still maintain a sense of community with your fellow students across time zones.
To be awarded LLM Medical Law and Ethics you must successfully complete six courses, five of which must be core courses, and a 10,000-word dissertation during your chosen duration of study.
During your studies you will also have the opportunity to study up to two courses from different subject areas such as information technology law or international commercial law.
Please note the available choice of courses in any given year may change.

At the University of Oxford, we are committed to harnessing the transformative potential of generative AI for our students, staff and academics. This cutting-edge technology is unlocking new opportunities across teaching, learning, research and administrative work for the University. Exploring the possibilities of AI is helping us to lead the way in innovation while upholding the rigour, integrity and thoughtfulness that define scholarship at the Oxford.
Recognising the importance of the technology in our future and our students’ future we are partnering with technology providers including Microsoft and OpenAI to ensure access to appropriate tools. We are investing in support and training to allow staff and students to experiment with generative AI in safe and responsible ways. Read on to learn how we’re embracing AI in education, research and everyday work and where to get help and guidance.
Learning with GenAI
How students and scholars use GenAI at Oxford
Through tailored workshops, accessible tools and expert support, the University provides personalised guidance to integrate generative AI tools into education effectively and responsibly. Whether it's using AI to generate unique teaching materials, breaking down language barriers for students or exploring creative applications in future research, Oxford ensures that generative AI enhances—not replaces—the critical thinking and originality that define its academic excellence.
Oxford students must understand AI's capabilities and limitations to be prepared for a fast-changing world. By helping them to use and experience generative AI, we prepare them to navigate and shape this evolving field responsibly. Oxford was one of the leading contributors to the Russell Group Principles on generative AI and has adopted them in AI in teaching and assessment.
Generative AI also facilitates dynamic teaching strategies, such as generating real-time examples, creating multilingual teaching materials or simulating scenarios for experiential learning. These tools enable our tutors and lecturers to craft richer, more engaging lessons.
Piloting AI in education
Twelve new projects are expanding the frontiers of AI at Oxford, experimenting with real uses for GenAI in the classroom. See the pilots supported by the AI & Machine Learning Centre, in partnership with the Centre for Teaching & Learning.
Guidance for Students
We believe that developing skills in the responsible use of AI will be an important part of future life and work for Oxford students. Find out how you can use AI to support your learning at Oxford.
AI in academic practice
As scholars begin to use generative AI to assist with research, we need to ensure that the technology continues to be used responsibly by providing the latest advice, support and resources. Read the latest guidance published at Oxford.
Researching with GenAI
How researchers use GenAI at Oxford
Research has always been central to Oxford’s mission, and generative AI is unlocking extraordinary opportunities to advance our knowledge across many disciplines. By enabling researchers to analyse vast datasets, generate hypotheses and visualise complex results at unprecedented speed and scale, AI is accelerating the pace of discovery. In the arts, humanities and social sciences, generative AI is opening new creative possibilities, synthesising data to produce unique interpretations and modelling intricate systems to explore uncharted academic terrain. Experimenting with GenAI is also fostering greater interdisciplinary collaboration. Building AI-powered research tools can bridge different fields of study, sharing ideas and aiding seamless communication.
We’re enabling all of this work, giving researchers the tools and technology they need to push the boundaries of innovation while staying at the forefront of responsible AI use.
Resources for researchers
GenAI has the potential to enhance your research. Learn how researchers at Oxford can access AI tools, and how you can protect your data and ensure you’re using the right methods.
What research has AI enabled?
Discover how Oxford scientists are using AI to tackle global health issues, compose symphonies, monitor the illegal wildlife trade and look for life on Mars.
Ethics in AI
The University of Oxford’s Institute for Ethics in AI is bringing together world-leading humanities experts with technical developers and users of AI to conduct research on ethical implications in AI, including in governance, society and the environment.
Working with GenAI
How staff use GenAI at Oxford
Efficiency and innovation are essential to maintaining Oxford’s position as a global leader, and generative AI is revolutionising how the University manages and delivers its services. AI enables staff to concentrate on high-impact work, automating routine tasks to leave more time for human planning and judgement. It also improves accessibility by providing advanced tools like real-time transcription, translation and personalised support, increasing inclusivity of the University’s services. We’re also exploring using AI to enrich communication with prospective students, alumni and partners, delivering tailored content and faster response times that strengthen our relationships. By giving staff controlled access to generative AI tools, we’re ensuring that the data of staff and students is protected.
What can GenAI do for you every day?
Over a six-month pilot, over 500 staff at Oxford have been piloting generative AI tools in their departments. Hear from academics, administrators and researchers how AI is streamlining their work and unlocking new possibilities.

Student Testimonial
Eduardo Xavier Astorquiza Cesped, Master of Laws (LLM)
""After working as a domestic litigation lawyer in Chile for seven years, I realized that I had a lack of in-depth knowledge on international dispute resolution. I chose King’s LLM because it comprises several modules within this area, giving one the opportunity to follow a pathway on International Dispute Resolution.
I believe that the LLM will help me with the next steps in my career by improving my perspectives, after being taught by top scholars and shared with classmates from all over the world.
King’s offers a great deal of networking opportunities, which always help when practicing law. This funding has not only enhanced my experience as a student but also allowed me to be here in the first place, focusing on the studies without being constantly worried about the costs of the programme.""",38,74.2,King’s College London,13.9,75.1,32835,38,kcl.ac.uk,59.8,1802:24,79.0,97.5,United Kingdom,administrative communications,4.691696404832432,0.6676056338028169,369,False,38

Programme website: Law
This general LLM programme is the ideal choice for students wishing to expose themselves to diverse areas of advanced legal scholarship. We offer a very wide range of specialist courses, many taught by internationally recognised experts in their fields, and legal and industry professionals.
You will select courses from across the School’s key research and teaching fields, including:
- commercial law
- criminal law
- criminology
- EU law
- IP, media and technology law
- international law
- legal history and legal theory
- medical law
- private law
- public law
This structure ensures you can pursue a truly diverse and challenging curriculum through which you will be able to develop a broad expertise in cutting-edge legal scholarship.
This programme is made up from 120 credits of taught courses and a 60-credit dissertation on an approved topic (generally one that builds upon one of the courses that you have studied with us).
There are no compulsory courses on the general LLM that all students have to take. Instead you may choose from the diverse range of specialist courses offered within the School (subject to the availability of places or whether courses are running in a given year). However, as the General LLM qualification reflects expertise across a range of subjects, there are limits on the number of courses which can be taken from any one subject area.
You will experience a range of teaching styles on this programme and we expect you to prepare in advance by reading the required materials and reflecting on the issues to be discussed. We will assess your participation in classes.
For the dissertation, we will allocate you a supervisor, who will provide guidance and support. The purpose of the dissertation however, is to allow you to independently design and conduct an original piece of research and analysis.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.
Find out more about compulsory and optional courses
We link to the latest information available. Please note that this may be for a previous academic year and should be considered indicative.
By the end of this programme, you should have acquired a more sophisticated understanding of your chosen subjects, including the diverse functions of law in contemporary society, differing approaches to the subject and a greater familiarity with research materials and methods.
The LLM in Law is an excellent way to broaden ones knowledge across a range of areas of legal specialism, gain understanding of the synergies and principles applicable across legal disciplines and identify areas of interest for a career in legal practice or academic research.
Many recent graduates have used the programme as a platform for further study. Others who are professionally qualified are now working as:
- attorneys
- lawyers
- legal advisers and specialists
- financial analysts
- tax associates
For organisations including:
- Deloitte
- The Royal Bank of Scotland
- the Brooklyn Supreme Court
- the Supreme Court of Japan

Support for staff in making changes to their assessment approaches.
Assessments which ask students to discuss or reflect on a very specific case, scenario or critical incident are less vulnerable to AI. The tools can do these tasks, but they are currently producing quite generic work.
Writing or producing an output for assessment is a process and this should be emphasised to students. One method of doing this is setting tasks for completion throughout the course (these can be marked and/or given feedback or not) which students have to submit as part of their finished product, e.g. outlines, drafts, summaries, syntheses of research.
There are more ideas for how to do this in the 'authentic assessment module' section. It is important to note that where students see value in an assessment they are more likely to engage fully and meaningfully and are less likely to look for shortcuts or to drift into questionable approaches.
This is time consuming but the best way to assess the vulnerability of your exam is to run it through an AI tool. This is useful for more quantitative subjects as well. It can allow you to redesign the assessment once you know what sort of answer the tools are producing.
Most open access (and free) AI tools cannot currently read images very well, though Bing Chat has recently introduced this functionality and it is worth familiarising yourself with its capabilities. Whether in MCQs or in short answers where students have to interpret data, you should use a range of ways of presenting information, such as images, data files etc. that students have to analyse/interpret.
An important caveat here is considerations of accessibility in examinations. If images cannot be read by screen readers, this means that your questions will have to be adjusted for visually impaired students. This has implications for universal design for learning.
Avoid questions which only ask for definitions, explanations or calculations. Generative AI tools are very good at coding and computational activities.
Questions which test higher order skills (creating, evaluating) are less vulnerable to Generative AI.
For questions which do require factual recall to meet learning outcomes, weight these as low as possible or integrate the knowledge recall as part of a higher order skill.
Generative AI tools are trained to predict the next word or string of words and cannot make conceptual leaps. You can interrupt this to some extent by designing exam questions which build on each other or are in parts, for example multi step problems. This also helps to assess higher order skills such as application to a range of scenarios.
You do have to consider the fairness of this however, when designing your exams and how this relates to the learning outcomes. If students cannot answer the first question, they will fail subsequent questions. This will depend on whether we are testing discrete items of knowledge.
This is a solution for exams where factual knowledge is required for a PSRB (professional body) or to meet foundational learning outcomes. Paper or digital exams can be invigilated in a secure environment such as computer lab or exam hall. It is already being used as a solution to prevent collusion in online examinations post-pandemic and is a requirement for some accrediting bodies.
However, this is not necessarily a solution for longer term assessment for learning and educational goals. Exams have been shown to encourage surface learning, create anxiety and are open to claims of being less inclusive than other forms of assessment (Waterfield and West, 2006; Tai et al, 2023). As King’s guidance on Generative AI states, it is important that AI literacy is built into our education and therefore closed book invigilated exams are not a response in the long term to challenges of Large Language Models.
Ensure that students have opportunities to practice the skills needed for the coursework assignment. This does not have to be formalised written drafts, although where possible, it’s good to have students write something. This can also be used to compare the finished assignment as a possible detection measure.
Formative tasks do not have to add significantly to marking workload, provided that students are doing more in seminars than just discussion work. The extra workload is in planning lessons that allow for more experiential learning and collaborative work (including writing and practising skills for the assessment).
Feedback can be individual but it can also be through:
Includes routine and established use of tools such as auto transcription, spell checkers, grammar check.
Use for clearly delineated tasks as appropriate/allowed/ recommended. May include:
No specific restrictions but with requirement to track key stages/tools utilised. Possible uses may include:
AI use is a feature of the assessment itself. Here the use of generative AI is a focal aspect of the assessment. This may include:
Programme teams should decide where the use of generative AI tools will and will not be permitted or appropriate for specific assessments and the level of use that is deemed acceptable. This should be clearly communicated to students at the start of a module. It is likely that there may be differences between modules.
There are two options from the university's guidance which can be added to a coursework cover sheet for students to show the level of their use. This should be in conjunction with the decision made by the module/programme team around levels of acceptable use. This can be added to a cover sheet/KEATS declaration for plagiarism.
Please note, at KCL we will seek to define acceptable/ fair use rather than trying to specify what is prohibited. An assessment is designed to both develop and evaluate your progress so it is never appropriate to submit chunks of text or other media that are duplicated from another source without clear acknowledgement. Because tools like ChatGPT are generating text on a predication model they are not quotable sources and are not appropriate places to focus research.
King’s College London, unlike some other universities, does not require students to reference generative AI as an authoritative source in the reference list for much the same reason you would not be expected to cite a search engine, a student essay website or be over-dependent on synoptic, secondary source material. However, as we learn more about the capabilities and limitations of these tools and as we work together to evolve our own critical AI literacies, we do expect you to be explicit in acknowledging your use of generative AI tools such as Large Language Models like Microsoft Bing Chat (available via your KCL account in Microsoft Edge), Google Bard or ChatGPT or any other media generated through similar tools.
You should select one of the following two statements, complete it and append it to your references or somewhere prominent with your submission. Please note that so long as acknowledged use falls within the scope of appropriate use as defined in the assessment brief/ guidance then this will not have any direct impact on the grades awarded.
Declarations in (2) below are an important reflective step and should be considered necessary.
1. I declare that no part of this submission has been generated by AI software. These are my own words.
Note. Using software for English grammar and spell checking is consistent with Statement 1.
[or]
2. I declare that parts of this submission has contributions from AI software and that it aligns with acceptable use as specified as part of the assignment brief/ guidance and is consistent with good academic practice. The content can still be considered as my own words. I understand that as long as my use falls within the scope of appropriate use as defined in the assessment brief/ guidance then this declaration will not have any direct impact on the grades awarded.
I acknowledge use of software to [include as appropriate]:
[insert AI tool(s) and links and/or how used]
[insert AI tool(s) and links]
[insert AI tool(s) and links] / Include brief details]
There should always be an option for students who do not wish to use it to explain that they have not and why.

Introduction
This bespoke new interdisciplinary programme aims to equip you with the skills and knowledge necessary for professionals in roles at the interface of law and the financial markets, allowing you to operate effectively in a globalised market and enhancing your adaptability and competence in a wide range of functions.
The programme offers a comprehensive and rigorous curriculum that delves into the intricate intersections between legal frameworks and financial markets, providing a comprehensive understanding of fundamental concepts and principles of finance and their relevance for both legal rules and legal practice.
Taught jointly by the LSE Law School and Department of Finance, you'll have the opportunity to study in two of the most highly rated departments in their subject areas in the world.
Central to this programme are how closely the core courses are integrated: these have been carefully designed by academics in both departments to ensure students can review common situations in companies from both a legal and financial perspective, and ensure a holistic understanding of how corporations raise capital and complete transactions.
Access to a range of courses, both from the Department of Finance and the LLM programme, will enable you to complement the core Law and Finance modules with a wide range of specialised legal and financial courses, adding additional depth to your knowledge in your chosen specialist areas.

Competition for places at LSE is strong. So, even if you meet the minimum entry requirements, this does not guarantee you an offer of a place.
However, please don’t feel deterred from applying – we want to hear from all suitably qualified students. Think carefully about how you can put together the strongest possible application to help you stand out from other students.
Programme content
You'll attend a full-time pre-sessional programme starting in early September. This will consist of preparatory academic classes, the Professional Development Programme, and opportunities to get to know your fellow classmates.
We recognise that students will come to this degree with a broad range of prior academic and professional experience. The pre-sessional course we offer brings everyone up to a common level of knowledge in critical concepts and knowledge. As such, this degree is suitable both for those moving on from recent undergraduate study, and those with professional experience making a career pivot.
The preparatory academic classes will cover materials in both law (an introduction to common law legal systems and the law of contract in these systems, as well as legal financial concepts and rules) and finance (quantitative methods; financial modelling; interpreting financial statements).
The Professional Development Programme is designed to provide a high level of careers support to new students, providing opportunities to develop their career skills, to receive personalised careers support in the form of one-to-one sessions with dedicated Careers Consultants.
Year 1
In the first term, you'll take several courses, including ""Corporate Finance: Law"" and “Principles of Corporate Finance for MSc Law and Finance"", two core courses unique to the programme. These courses have been carefully designed to ensure you can competently navigate complex transactions from both legal and financial perspectives. This includes a holistic understanding of how corporations finance their operations and how – and why – they acquire other businesses.
In the second term, you'll build upon this foundational knowledge. You'll transition to the bespoke “Corporate Transactions: Law"" and “Corporate Transactions: Finance” courses, which will look at a variety of corporate transactions and offer practical insight into real-world transactions and their documentation. Designed specifically for the Law and Finance programme, this cutting-edge course is unique in its structure, interweaving faculty expertise from both the Law School and Department of Finance to provide students with a 360-degree perspective which encompasses an in-depth analysis of financial and legal factors, as well as the interplay between these two considerations. Exposure to practical, real-world scenarios and case studies is key here, with faculty leveraging their professional networks, bolstered by LSE’s position, close to the legal and financial hubs of London, to provide insight into how top firms assess and execute deals at the highest level.
You'll also take several other courses, as listed below.
By the end of the year, you'll have taken courses to the total value of four units.

Learning and assessment
How you learn
How you're assessed
There are two types of course work at LSE, formative and summative.
Formative coursework doesn't count towards your final mark. Formative coursework enables students to develop a sense for how well they're doing in terms of understanding course material.
Summative assessment does count towards your final mark. This can take various forms, such as e-exams/digi-exams, in-class assessments under exam-style conditions., group presentations, individual or group projects, empirical or programming exercises, or class participation.
An indication of the formative coursework and summative assessment for each course can be found in the relevant course guide.
Exams will take place in both the January and Spring Term exam periods. Some courses do not involve a final exam.

Below you will find a list of specific projects as well as general outlines for possible projects that have been submitted by Faculty members looking to recruit a summer research student. *New projects may be added throughout January and February so do check back*
You can enquire about any projects you are interested in by writing to the contact given in the project listing below.
Applying for one of the projects listed on this page is not the only way of finding a research project in the CMS for summer 2025. Many supervisors do not advertise a specific project, but are happy to discuss possibilities with interested students. You can contact academics from this list of pre-approved supervisors in the subject areas you are interested in to enquire about a project with them this summer.
Once you have identified up to three projects / supervisors that you would be interested to work with you should submit the SRIM Expression of Interest form by 28 February 2025 (Cambridge maths students) or Internship Expression of Interest form by 21 February 2025 (applicants from other departments and universities – please check you are eligible as an external applicant before contacting supervisors about projects).
Group Projects
Mathematics research is an extremely collaborative subject and we believe that group projects where 2-3 students work together collaboratively on one problem more accurately reflects the experience you might have during a PhD in mathematics. Furthermore, feedback has shown that working together in a group is more enjoyable for summer students. In 2025 we are offering three group projects: two in DAMTP and two in DPMMS. Funding has already been set aside for these projects so a bursary application will not be necessary for the students selected.

Our normal minimum entry requirement is a completed LLM degree or other masters-level qualification, awarded with an average mark of 70 per cent (distinction/first class honours) or equivalent. Meeting this requirement does not in itself guarantee entry, as we typically receive many more such applications each year than we have places available.
Your application should also give us a clear idea of what you want to research and why. You should state the general area in which you wish to undertake research, and provide a detailed outline of the specific questions you intend to investigate within that field. You should indicate the ways in which your proposed study would be a significant and original contribution to knowledge. You should identify the materials you expect to need, where you expect to find them, and the methods and/or framework of analysis you propose to use. Finally, you should explain how your proposed project is a good fit with other research work done within the Law School.
More detailed information on the admissions requirements for the programme is available in the PhD Programme in Law: FAQs.
English language requirements
If your first language is not English or if the language of instruction of your previous degree is not English, we ask you to provide evidence of your command of English. We require the following minimum scores in IELTS (International English Language Testing System):
7.5 overall in IELTS (at least 7.0 in listening and writing, 7.0 in reading and 6.5 in speaking)
A postgraduate degree taught in English at an institution in a majority English speaking country will meet our English language requirements.
Funding
LSE Law School aims to ensure that all students have suitable funding for their studies. This is typically achieved through the award of an LSE PhD Studentship, which provides an annual stipend and covers the cost of fees for four years. The Law School offers an augmented Studentship (approx. £24,500 per year for 2024/25 entry) which requires students to carry out 100 hours of teaching over the course of their four years of PhD studies. There is no separate application process for LSE PhD Studentships, as funding awards are considered alongside admission to the doctoral programme.
Appropriate candidates may alternatively be supported to apply for London Arts and Humanities Partnership (LAHP) Doctoral Training Studentships. Candidates who have already secured funding for their studies at the time of application to the PhD programme (for instance, from their employer or through a national government) may wish to state this in their application.
Additional Law School Financial Support
In addition to the generous LSE PhD Studentship scheme, you can expect to draw from several additional sources of financial support during your PhD.
PhD Research Allowance
Every PhD student receives a personal research allowance from the Law School of £1,000 per annum for funding research related expenses. This fund may be used to fund the purchase of books and equipment relating to your research, paying for language courses and attendance at conferences.
Proof Reading for Final Year PhD Students
All final year PhD students in the Law School are eligible to apply for funds to cover the cost of proofreading their doctoral thesis up to the value of £750.
PhD Field Work Fund
All Law PhD students conducting field work relevant to their research may apply to the Law School for a one-off award up to the value of £5,000 to cover costs incurred in conducting their research.
Law PhD Hardship Fund
All Law PhD students have access to a hardship fund. Awards of up to £1,000 can be made in cases of exceptional need.
Application process and fees

This toolkit provides an introduction to GenAI and includes materials you can use with your students to facilitate discussions around use of GenAI.
12 September 2023
(last updated December 2024)
As generative AI (GenAI) becomes more widespread, accessible and easy to use, it will continue to impact the way we engage in teaching, learning, and assessment in higher education.
UCL promotes ethical and transparent engagement with GenAI tools.
Discussing GenAI with your students is essential to help develop a shared understanding of its appropriate use and to support students in building critical AI literacy. This toolkit provides guidance for having these conversations with your students.
Only got a minute? Jump straight to how to start discussions about GenAI with your students and download the template slides
What is GenAI?
Artificial Intelligence is a field of scientific research and development. It includes subfields such as machine learning which uses algorithms to analyse huge amounts of data.
GenAI is a recent example of neural networks trained on massive datasets to generate new content from simple prompts. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT (Open AI), Bard (Google), or Claude (Anthropic) can generate text in multiple languages and styles. Other generative programs generate images, video, audio, and code from text instructions.
To find out more, read about our introduction to GenAI.
UCL’s policy on GenAI
Departments and/or module leaders should decide what use of GenAI is appropriate in their assessment. They should refer to new guidance, found on the UCL's Feedback and Assessment sharepoint site [UCL users only].
While these tools are powerful and easy to use, they can also provide misleading or incorrect information. Students should always be strongly encouraged to take a critical approach to use of any output from a GenAI, as these tools not only generate superficial, inaccurate and unhelpful outputs, but may also undermine the learning process. They can create shortcuts that reduce the need for a student’s critical engagement, which is key to deep and meaningful learning. It is important that students understand the difference between reasonable and unreasonable use of these technologies.
There is no simple solution to the challenges created by GenAI in learning, teaching, and assessment. It is important that staff familiarise themselves with the opportunities and risks posed by these technologies and discuss with students within their disciplinary and educational context.
GenAI and assessment
By focussing on the responsible and appropriate use of GenAI, we should consider why we are assessing students, what we want students to learn, and how students can demonstrate their learning.
- Consider your module learning outcomes. What do you want your students to achieve with this assessment? What core skills do you intend for them to develop? Will the use of GenAI help or hinder students from achieving their learning goals? Make sure you consider the diverse learning needs of your student cohort when you are thinking about how your students might achieve their learning goals.
- Consider how exactly students may or may not use GenAI for your assessment in order to meet learning outcomes. Most students do not want to short-cut their learning. They want you to be clear and explicit on how they can and cannot use GenAI.
- UCL has developed three categories to provide guidance for when and how students can use GenAI in their assessments. These categories are to help you clarify expectations with your students. Each category describes a general approach with examples. You may adapt these categories, offer additional clarification, and include different examples. The three categories are:
Category 1: GenAI tools cannot be used beyond what is specified in the UCL Academic Manual (9.2.6a).
Category 2: GenAI tools can be used in an assistive role.
Category 3: GenAI has an integral role.
Departments, programme leaders, and/or module tutors must decide which category to employ for their assessments in advance.
4. Ensure that your decision is communicated and explained to students. Assessment cover sheets could include a statement for students to declare “I have read, understood and abided by the restrictions on the use of generative AI for this assignment.”
Discuss use of GenAI with your students
To support teaching staff to facilitate a discussion with students on GenAI we have produced a template student-facing slide deck. The slides introduce GenAI, guidance on its use in assessments, and include prompts for discussions and interactive teaching moments. The slides are merely a template and should be adapted for use with your department or programme.
Download the template slides [pptx]
How should I use these slides?
The slides are designed as a 1-hour lecture. This lecture could be delivered live in induction week, later in term 1 within a core module, or circulated to students as an asynchronous video. You might change the order of the sections (for example, swapping section 2 and 3) depending on what would work best for your students.
How are the slides structured?
The slides are structured in four parts. You will be required to edit the template for content and clarity. Slides with a stone-coloured background provide guidance for the educator and should be deleted.
1. What is GenAI?
The first section (slides 4-10) provides a general introduction to GenAI and includes mentimeter discussion prompts on its limitations and ethical considerations. The mentimeter slides are available as a template from (login with your UCL SSO and search GenAI and You).
2. Is it appropriate to use GenAI tools in your education?
This section (slides 11-20) provides three optional examples of “teaching moments” that you might consider for your session. You will likely only have time for one or two of these “teaching moments.” You will need to edit these slides to remove the instructions and to provide your own examples.
Option 1 (slides 12-13) is an example mentimeter discussion of student perspectives on the use of different tools in their disciplinary context.
Option 2 (slides 14-15) suggests a discussion on ethical usage of GenAI using mentimeter or mural.
Option 3 (slides 16-20) provides two examples, one from History and one from Physics, on how to critique an AI-generated output (critical discussion is in the notes box).
3. What are UCL’s rules on academic integrity and GenAI?
This section (slides 21-27) includes an overview of UCL’s GenAI and assessment categories. You should delete the categories that do not apply to your module/programme. Ensure you are clear to students when and how they can or cannot use GenAI. The section also includes guidance for students on how to acknowledge their use of GenAI, if this has been permitted in the module/programme.
4. What next?
The final section (slides 28-32) includes links to further UCL resources, as well as suggestions for how students might productively make use of GenAI to support their learning, and an opportunity for questions.
How do I obtain the mentimeter slides?
The mentimeter can be found as a template. Log-in to with your UCL SSO. Click on “Shared templates” and search (using ctrl/cmd+F) for “GenAI and You”. You will then be able to create your own version of the mentimeter.
Where can I find out more about building GenAI into my teaching and assessment?
You should contact your Faculty Learning Technologist, Digital Assessment Advisor or your HEDS Faculty Partnership Team.

This manifesto and principles cut through the hype around generative AI to provide a framework that supports scholars and students in figuring out if, rather than how, generative AI contributes to their scholarship. This approach reminds us that what is at stake is nothing less than our educational values.
The materials were prepared by Dr Ella McPherson, SHSS Deputy Head and Director of Education (manifesto); Prof Matei Candea, SHSS Academic Project Director for Technology and Teaching (principles); and Megan Capon, SHSS Academic Project Coordinator (overall support and AI-declaration framework). We prepared them at the request of the SHSS Council to support departments and faculties in local policy decisions around generative AI. These decisions relate to the University’s designation of the use of AI in assessments as academic misconduct unless expressly allowed and acknowledged. We gratefully received and incorporated feedback from several members of SHSS on the manifesto and principles.
This set of resources includes a manifesto written for scholars and those practicing and policy-making about teaching and research; a set of principles for approaching decisions about generative AI; an open letter aimed at a student audience; and further, practical resources for clarifying and communicating local policies.

Programme website: Global Environment and Climate Change Law
Environmental law is a dynamic, fast-developing and globally important area of law that requires not only specialist legal knowledge but also an understanding of underpinning political, economic and scientific issues.
This programme is designed to equip you with an advanced, multidisciplinary knowledge of the legal issues and techniques related to environmental protection, with special emphases on climate change and the marine environment.
You will analyse and evaluate the historic and ongoing development of international, European and national law for environmental protection, the interrelations between these different levels of law-making and the interactions between environmental law and other areas of law. You may also have the opportunity to take environment-related courses from other University of Edinburgh schools, including the School of Social and Political Science and the School of GeoSciences, and Edinburgh University Business School.
You must complete 180 credits of study – 60 credits are taken in the compulsory dissertation and the remaining 120 credits are taken in taught courses.
You will experience a range of teaching styles on these courses, led by members of Edinburgh Law School academic community and experienced legal and industry practitioners.
You are expected to prepare in advance by reading the required materials and by reflecting on the issues to be discussed, and your participation in classes will be assessed.
For the dissertation you will have a supervisor from whom you can expect guidance and support, but the purpose of the dissertation is to allow you to independently design and conduct a piece of research and analysis.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.
By the end of the programme, students will have acquired an in-depth understanding of concepts, innovations and challenges characterising the law on environmental protection, natural resource management and responses to climate change, at the international, European and national level.
Students will also develop the critical skills necessary to carry out independent analysis of the activity of international and supranational legal and political institutions, national governments and domestic courts, NGOs and the private sector in this field.
Openness to different scholarly approaches within law will be encouraged, by offering the opportunity to complement specialised law courses with courses offered by the School of Social and Political Science, the Business School and the School of Geosciences addressing questions related to the scientific and socio-economic aspects of environmental protection.
The programme is suitable to prepare students for the increasingly broad range of specialised job opportunities offered at the national and international level by the public and private sector, as well as for advanced research.
The Global Environment & Climate Change Law programme is a gateway to graduates finding careers as specialised legal drafters, government advisers, international negotiators, legal advisers to private companies and NGOs, international civil servants, specialised researchers in academic and think-tank institutions and independent consultants.
The University of Edinburgh's Careers Service offers support to students to identify internship opportunities in international and non-governmental organisations, academia and think-tanks. Recent graduates are now working in legal roles internationally, including in India, Mexico and the Netherlands, and for the European Commission.
These entry requirements are for the 2025/26 academic year and requirements for future academic years may differ. Entry requirements for the 2026/27 academic year will be published on 1 Oct 2025.
A UK 2:1 honours degree, or its international equivalent, in law.
We will also consider candidates with a degree in a related discipline which includes relevant prior study.
In evaluating your application for postgraduate study, greater emphasis may be placed upon results of prior learning in subjects relevant to the intended degree programme.
Entry to this programme is competitive. Meeting minimum requirements for consideration does not guarantee an offer of study.

**New for 2024/25: Catalyst Spotlight Fund on Generative AI**
Three innovative projects have been awarded funding through the Eden Catalyst Spotlight Fund on Generative AI in Education. The fund has been designed to enhance the teaching and learning experience of our students through the integration of generative AI into teaching and learning while also supporting research to increase our understanding of generative AI tools.
The three successful projects explore diverse aspects of generative AI in education enabling the development of teaching and learning within specific disciplines while will also generating insights and applications relevant across the School.
- Edoardo Zulato and colleagues in the Department of Psychological and Behavioral Science will draw on content analysis, conversation analysis and protocol analysis to investigate students' social interactions with LLMs;
- Carrie Friese, course convenor of SO492: Qualitative Social Research Methods, is developing a new approach to large group teaching for SO492 and introducing new teaching and learning activities on AI and qualitative research. These innovations, combined with other elements of the course, will provide postgraduate taught students in the Department of Sociology with opportunities to learn about the potential applications of AI in qualitative social research as well as generate lessons for large-scale class teaching to inform evolving practice across the School;
- Ronny Razin and Antonio Mele from the Department of Economics are designing and testing a conversational tool that will support students in approaching problem sets and highlight areas for improvement. The tool will be flexible and adaptable to different learners within Economics.
Emma McCoy, Pro-Vice Chancellor for Education, commented ‘I am delighted to see the outcome of the Eden Catalyst Spotlight awards showcasing three fascinating projects that will deepen our understanding of how generative AI can be effectively used in education.

This guide © 2024 by UCL - Library Skills is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
This guidance presents UCL's general approach to acknowledging the use of generative AI and referencing generative AI. Generative AI (GenAI) is evolving rapidly and there is not yet general consensus on how to acknowledge and reference it. This guidance will therefore continue to be reviewed and updated.
Before using GenAI, you should ensure that:
GenAI can be a useful starting point to gather background information on a topic, but be aware that:
If you do choose to use GenAI tools, you must always:
The use of GenAI must be acknowledged in any piece of academic work where it has been used as a functional tool to assist in the process of creating the academic work, such as drafting ideas and planning or structuring written materials.
It is the nature of the task that determines whether use needs acknowledgement or not. This will be discipline and assessment dependent, so it is for teaching staff to determine. However, the following general principles may be used.
Instances where use of GenAI may not require acknowledgement include:
Teaching staff should ensure they discuss these principles with their students and make expectations clear. Students should ask teaching staff if further clarification is needed.
The use of GenAI should be acknowledged in an ‘Appendix’ or 'Methods' section of any piece of academic work
Minimum requirement to include in acknowledgement:
For example:
I acknowledge the use of Microsoft Copilot (version GPT-4, Microsoft, to summarise my initial notes and to proofread my final draft.
Further requirements may be stipulated by a department, academic programme or individual teaching staff, or for a particular assignment, and must be made clear to students when an assignment is set. Additional requirements may include expanded description in an ‘Appendix’ or ‘Methods’ section, such as:
These acknowledgements as an appendix should not be included in the word count of a piece of work, unless stipulated otherwise for a particular assignment or by a particular academic programme or department. The appendix should either be placed at the beginning or end of the document.
Some referencing styles suggest that GenAI systems should be cited in a similar way to other sources, most notably personal communications, but there are issues with citing GenAI systems:
This proposal therefore favours the approach of most academic publishers (1-3), which stipulates GenAI systems should not be cited as an author nor included as a source in the reference list.
There may be cases where it is appropriate or necessary for a student or researcher to refer to AI-generated output within a piece of work and / or include it in a reference list, e.g. where the piece of work addresses the topic of GenAI and discussion around outputs, where there is reference to a formally published output generated by AI, where it is required by the academic department, or where a student has not identified a primary source of the information despite the issues with relying on GenAI as a secondary source of information (which may be considered poor academic practice). Students are advised to check with their department.
In such cases, the output should be treated as a work with no author, unless specified otherwise by departmental guidelines or the standardised referencing style you are using.
Where a student or researcher is required to use a standard referencing style which has specific rules for citing and referencing GenAI, the rules of the citation style should be followed, in addition to acknowledging the use of GenAI as outlined above. This may require the use of in-text citations and reference list entries where the GenAI tool is listed as an author. E.g. APA, Chicago.

George Spyrou came to Christ’s in 1971 to read for an LLM, having gained a BA from Harvard earlier that year. He studied under many leading practitioners including Mr David Yale and Professor Sir Elihu Lauterpacht and had a strong interest in international law. He made lifelong friends with some of his fellow students and was a strong supporter of the College until his early death in 2010, serving as a member of the US Campaign Board during the College’s Quincentenary Fundraising Campaign.
Tim Lintott also matriculated at Christ's in 1971 to read Law. As well as his success in his academic work, he was a talented rugby player, gaining his Blue and becoming a member of the Hawks' Club. He went on to become a Partner at Freshfields. Tim was a member of the College's Development Board, and was elected a Lady Margaret Beaufort Fellow of the College in recognition of his support. He was the driving force behind the Spyrou Scholarship, which has now been renamed the Spyrou-Lintott Scholarship.

References
We are happy to provide students of our chair with a reference letter, if they fulfill the following requirements: (1) Prior participation in our courses, (2) Successful completion of the exams. Please read the information below carefully and contact rwp@ with your request.
Reference Letter Guidance
Graduate Programme application
- A main prerequisite is the participation with above average success in at least one of our specialization courses in accounting held for higher semesters (lecture, seminar), bachelor thesis at our institute or contact with the instiute otherwise (e.g., as a tutor or student assistant). Please understand that a letter of reference from our institute cannot serve its expected purposes in any other case.
- Please send your current transcript of records (as automatically generated via the online examination office) and your CV to the institute management (rwp@) in order for your request to be examined. Without these documents we cannot help you. Let us know in advance if you have special requests with respect to your letter of reference.
- Various universities are not satisfied with a basic letter of reference but require specific documents which have to be filled out by us. Please do not forget to bring these documents with you. Without these documents we cannot help you. More than a general letter of recommendation (""to whom it may concern"") can only be filled out for students that did participate in more than just one lecture, as this kind of assessment requires further information together with assessment of the personality.
- After a thorough examination of your documents, we will contact you. It is possible that a face-to-face meeting is necessary. Please note that this process can take some time. Therefore get in touch with us in time (at least 4 weeks in advance).
Scholarship Application
- A main prerequisite is the successful participation in at least one of our courses held for higher semesters (lecture, seminar), bachelor thesis at our institut or contact with the institute otherwise (e.g., as a tutor or student assistant). Please note that most scolarship programs require outstanding grades; which we will obviously have to consider when deciding to prepare a letter of reference.
- First please send your current transcript of records (automatically generated via the online examination office) and your CV to the institute management (rwp@), which we need in order to examine your request. Further, describe the purpose the certificate is needed for and send us all required documents (e.g. template of the foundation you are applying at). Let us know in advance if you have special requests with respect to your letter of reference.
- As this kind of assessment requires further information together with some extent of assessment of a student's personality, we can only issue reference letters to students who not only attended a lecture, but whom we also know personally and are therefore able to assess properly.
- Please note that this process may take some time. We will respond to your request as quickly as possible. Therefore get in touch with us in time (at least 4 weeks in advance).",39,100.0,LMU Munich,33.5,76.8,34622,39,lmu.de,65.3,1843:12,79.0,76.9,Germany,"syllabi, administrative communications",4.644019320878941,0.3493415956622773,1315,False,39

Programme website: International Banking Law and Finance
I'm really happy that I chose to study this programme as it not only provides extensive knowledge of the financial sector but also addresses current issues such as Fintech. All of the lecturers are experts in the field, so you know you're learning from the best.
Banking and finance underpins global markets that impact on the day to day activities of businesses and individuals around the world. To work in this high paced legal environment, you are expected to have developed a clear understanding of the regulation and practice of banking at national, supranational and international levels. The LLM in International Banking Law and Finance at Edinburgh Law School caters to those needs.
The principal aim of the LLM in International Banking Law and Finance is to provide postgraduate students with the opportunity for specialised advanced learning in certain key areas of banking and financial law and practice. The programme is forward thinking, considering emerging and developing technologies and their implications on the practice of banking and financing transactions.
The length of courses over one or two semesters plays a key role in fostering deep learning, enabling you to explore a wider variety of subjects in greater depth. You will enjoy significant flexibility in your course choices and can tailor your study to your needs and interests.
The main programme aims are to develop specialist knowledge in banking and finance law and practice, to foster independence of thought, critical reflection and the development of scholarly writing skills at an advanced level in law.
Specifically, this highly specialised LLM programme is suitable for ambitious students and professionals who aspire to pursue a successful career in the field of global financial markets and especially in the areas of:
- finance
- banking
- capital markets
- corporate finance
- financial technology
- accounting and law firms
It is also suitable for those who wish to pursue a successful career with regulatory authorities, central banks, and other public sector organisations. It will help you position yourself as a highly-skilled expert and future leader in the wider area of global financial markets, banking and finance law and regulation.
To enhance and broaden your professional prospects and horizons, some of the seminars in the programme are delivered by leading finance law practitioners/policymakers. This enables the programme to provide you with a good blend of theory and practical expertise.
A successful career in today’s global markets requires an extensive and in-depth knowledge of complex and sophisticated global and domestic finance laws, regulations and practices. This skillset may not be developed without extensive study and a solid understanding of the economic, financial, legal and regulatory theories and practices supporting the operation of global finance.
Based on the University of Edinburgh's strong law and finance expertise, the programme offers interdisciplinary, law and practice-oriented courses examining the legal, economic and political aspects of banking, corporate finance and the relevant regulatory frameworks at national, European and international levels. It also utilises key experience from practice to help you develop practical, problem-solving and drafting skills to handle complex policy, compliance, transaction structuring and completion challenges.
We pride ourselves on delivering intensive, high-quality teaching in small-group settings. This gives you the opportunity to study in detail the topics and subjects above through intellectually rigorous discussions guided by leading academics, including opportunities for feedback.
Seminars are challenging and students regularly present on seminar topics as well as engage in real-life or hypothetical case studies. Through frequent group presentations and by means of testing case studies, prepared and presented collectively by programme students, and students’ own study (revision) groups, you will benefit from the cross-fertilisation of different ideas and experiences. This approach facilitates critical discussion, and enables you to hone your problem-solving, presentation, and team-building skills.
Previous students have had the opportunity to attend guest lectures from high-profile speakers ranging from top regulators, including the European Central Bank and the Prudential Regulation Authority, to highly respected law professors, outstanding economists and lawyers.
This programme can be studied full time over one year, consists of 180 credits, comprising taught courses worth 120 credits (60 credits per semester) and a 10,000 word dissertation worth 60 credits.

Overview
Part of what a university education teaches is certain academic skills, such as assimilating information, constructing an evidence-based argument and expressing your thoughts in clear, coherent prose.
AI tools cannot replace human critical thinking or the development of scholarly evidence-based arguments and subject knowledge that forms the basis of your university education.
You can make use of generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, Bing Chat and Google Bard) in developing your academic skills to support your studies. Your ongoing critical appraisal of outputs by reviewing them for accuracy will maximise the potential for AI outputs to be a useful additional tool to support you in your studies.
In some instances academic staff, departments and colleges may give more detailed guidance on how they expect AI tools to be used (or not used) for different tasks or on specific assignments. You should always follow the guidance of your tutors, supervisors and department or faculty.
Ethical use of generative AI tools
Your ethical use of AI tools to support your learning is paramount to ensure you uphold the standards of academic rigour and academic integrity expected of you as a student studying at Oxford.
Students using AI during their studies must learn and practise the same academic skills of note-taking and clear attribution which are safeguards against plagiarism, ensuring clear differentiation of their own work from any text or material derived from any AI tools. Unauthorised use of AI falls under the plagiarism regulations and would be subject to academic penalties in summative assessments.
Where the use of generative AI in preparing work for examination has been authorised by the department, faculty or programme, you should give clear acknowledgment of how it has been used in your work.
The advice in this guide is in line with relevant university policies, which have been updated to provide examples of unauthorised uses of generative AI tools. Guidance on plagiarism is available from the Study skills and training webpages. The policy on the Use of Third Party Proof-readers is also relevant.
Five things to think about when using generative AI tools
- How can generative AI tools be useful in supporting your learning?
- How can generative AI tools be useful in developing your academic skills?
- How (and when) can you draw on AI outputs (knowing that different generative AI tools provide different outputs and that the same tool with the same prompts can produce different outputs)?
- How can you manage the risk of false information and fabrication?
- How can you ensure you maintain good academic practice?
Six tips to keep in mind when using generative AI tools
- Always cross-check AI generated outputs against established sources to verify accuracy and identify erroneous information.
- Give significant contextual information when asking questions or prompts and ask several follow-up questions to refine responses.
- Use personae in your prompts e.g. “I am an undergraduate student who is revising for a first-year calculus exam”.
- Give examples of the kind of responses you want.
- AI tools are not good at calculations so use other established tools, calculators, Excel or Mathematica.
- Do not share sensitive personal data such as financial details or passwords with AI tools. Avoid sharing your own or others intellectual property such as patents, trademarks, designs, sensitive information, or content created by others into any AI tools.
Five ideas for academic reading
Generative AI tools may be useful in supporting you to develop your academic reading skills. However, generative AI may, in some cases, undermine development of your academic reading skills (e.g., asking an AI tool to summarise an article rather than undertaking the task yourself).
Here are five ways you can use AI to support your academic reading, suggestions for how you might provide useful prompts, what some of the limitations are of the AI generated outputs, and how to engage critically with them to augment your learning.
- When reading a paper ask for a table of key terms or outline key points in the paper. Do this yourself before asking AI to do this and compare your terms or points. The AI tool can help you build a cognitive scaffolding of your reading of a paper but you cannot rely on it, so ensure you read the paper yourself.
- Ask AI to generate thought-provoking questions based on article content. You can develop your own understanding of an article by answering the questions asked. You could also use the questions to develop your own questions in relation to the article to deepen your learning.
- Ask AI to translate sections into another language. You can ask AI to translate text into your own language. Be sure to check the accuracy of the translation and that no significant meaning has been lost in translation. This could support your understanding of the article as you review the translation.
- Compare your own summary of a paper with one written by AI. AI can be a useful tool for providing a summary and supporting your reading of academic papers. Comparing your own understanding of the paper with an AI output can be a useful approach to developing your critical reading skills – both by recognising things you may have missed, and by giving you an opportunity to critique the AI output.
- Critically review all AI outputs. Ensure you critically review all AI outputs for accuracy to support your learning, and verify the outputs against other sources, e.g. can you locate all references and are they accurate to the text, and are the definitions correct?
Suggestions of prompts to try:
- You are an expert in [subject] and an educator who is good at giving great explanations to beginners. Make a table of the key concepts needed to understand the content of this paper.
- Give me a list of 20 key terms in this paper and break it into five categories.
- Rephrase this definition as a list of bullet points to help me understand it step by step.
- Make a list of propositions in this text in the format “X is a type of Y”, “W is caused by X”, “A explains B”. Put it into a table with three columns.
- Rephrase this sentence in simpler language that a non-expert can understand. You can break it into multiple sentences, if needed.
Five ideas for academic writing and presentation skills
Generative AI tools can be useful in developing your academic writing skills and providing initial feedback on them, translating between different styles and critiquing writing. AI tools cannot replace the need for you to develop these skills through teaching and independent learning.
Here are five ways you can use AI to develop and get feedback on your academic writing, suggestions for how you might provide useful prompts, what some of the limitations are of the AI generated outputs, and how to engage critically with them to augment your learning.
- Examples of writing in different styles and genres. AI can provide examples of many different written outputs. You may find this useful in identifying different styles of writing, appropriate to different tasks.
- Feedback on your writing. AI can provide rapid feedback on your writing, and this can be helpful for improving it, e.g. in relation to grammar and structure. AI cannot provide feedback nuanced to the rigour and expectations of academic writing in your specific subject so it cannot replace tutors’ feedback grounded in the context of your discipline. Be sure that you proof-read your own work, as this is an essential skill in academic writing, and do not use generative AI tools to make material changes to work in draft.
- Help you get started in writing. AI can be useful in overcoming writer’s block by providing some inspiration or points to consider when you are about to start writing.
- Suggesting ideas for graphics, images and visuals. AI can be useful in suggesting how you might present information in graphics, images and visuals to move beyond text-based presentation of information.
- Critically review all AI outputs. Ensure you critically review all AI outputs for accuracy and verify the outputs against other sources, e.g. can you locate all references and are they accurate to the text, and are the definitions accurate?
Suggestions of prompts to try:
- Here is a paragraph I wrote. Rewrite it as a list of bullet points with the key arguments I made.
- I am a student of [subject]. I wrote this as an example of academic writing. Give me feedback on where I could improve. Focus on clarity, academic language and grammar.
- Suggest some practice exercises I can use to improve my weak points.
Five ideas for supporting your learning
Generative AI tools can be useful in supporting your academic studies.
Here are five ways you can use AI to support your studies, suggestions for how you might provide useful prompts and what some of the limitations are of the AI generated outputs. Be sure to verify any AI outputs against other established sources to ensure their accuracy, and cross-check to confirm your understanding.
- Preparing for lectures. You can ask for key concepts related to the topic of the lecture and use the lecture to compare this with your initial understanding.
- Engaging with new or complex topics. You can ask AI for explanations to help you develop a better understanding for yourself. For example, you can ask for alternative explanations of a topic or analogies from different perspectives.
- Organising your notes. Generative AI tools can be used to convert your notes into structures that are easier for you to review. You can ask for a table of key concepts, facts or figures organised by different categories. Timelines, workflow summaries, outlines you can convert into mind maps or mnemonic devices can be generated to help you remember facts. Remember, even if AI looks like it is copying things from your text, it is actually generating the new version from scratch using your text as context, so you must review all outputs for accuracy.
- Enhancing your language study. You can use AI to improve your language learning. You can ask to have a conversation at a certain level on a specific subject, receive feedback on your conversation, or generate sample texts for practice. Always ensure you cross-check the outputs against other sources as outputs in some languages may contain basic grammatical errors. If working with long texts, for languages other than English, the volume of text you can translate or work with will be much shorter. Some languages with non-Latin alphabet (like Arabic) may only be able to fit 1/5th or even less than a language like French. Many languages not well represented on the internet may only work very partially with generative AI.
- Developing your coding skills. You can use AI to develop your coding skills. Write code as you do normally – writing in (functional) chunks and testing the chunks for the right functionality yourself. You could then compare these chunks with a given AI tool. You may find it useful to ask your tutor which AI tools are more appropriate for coding. As with all AI outputs it is not perfect, and any code needs to be run to check that it functions as expected. Common errors are: the code may produce an error message, the description of the code or suggestions for improvement are inaccurate, the code is completely incorrect, or uses features not present in the language or the code generates references to outdated or non-existent libraries. It would not be appropriate to use AI to write a code, or to support the writing of a code, on which your coding skills will be assessed.
Suggestions of prompts to try:
- I’m going to a lecture on [subject]. Give me a list of 20 key concepts I need to be prepared for. Break them into five categories and explain how they relate to each other. You are an expert in [subject] and always explain things in a way that is easy to understand for a student at [level]. Make a table of these terms with four columns. 1. Term, 2. Definition, 3. Category, 4. Related terms. Make a series of statements using these terms that will reveal the relationships between them. For example, working memory is a type of ….
- As an expert in [subject]. Here’s an explanation I was given of [concept]. Can you suggest some alternative explanations of [concept] to help me learn. I am a [level] student at university and have already taken [classes in…].
- You are an expert in [subject]. Here is a definition I was given of [term]. Can you give me five concrete examples that illustrate the definition. I want to be able to apply them in practice. For each example, specify exactly how it illustrates the definition.
- Here are my notes from class. Make me flashcards to help me study. Each flashcard should have the term on one side, and a brief explanation on the other. Use my explanations where available. If you have suggestions for alternatives, put them in italics so that I know what is in my words.
- You are a shop assistant in a bakery in Germany. I am a beginner student and I’ve come in to buy some bread. Let’s have a conversation in German. You start by greeting me and asking me what I want. You will pause and give me a chance to answer. Use simple language and always respond even if I say something using the wrong term. Do not use any English until I tell you to. Then make a table of all the things I said with three columns: 1. What I said, 2. What I should have said in correct German. 3. What error I made and how to correct it.
- I want to write code to do [describe task]. As an experienced programmer and a coach of new coders, suggest the best way to help me get started. Suggest the best language, coding environment, and dependencies. My level is [describe level].
Five tips for selecting the right generative AI tools for the task
There is a huge range of generative AI tools available, e.g. Microsoft Bing Chat, ChatGPT, Google Bard, Claude. Some of the tools are freely available and some with costs that bring extra features such as being able to work with large volumes of text.
- You will find it useful to try a few different AI tools and be aware that different tools will give different outputs using the same prompts and a tool will also generate different outputs to the same prompt.
- You will get different responses using the same prompts from the same AI tool. AI outputs are not repeatable, and all tools can generate outputs that can contain inaccuracies and fabrications.
- You could spend a lot of your study time trying out different AI tools. Be careful to manage your exploration of tools alongside managing your time.
- AI tools may draw on data that can be months or years out of date and whilst outputs seem plausible, they may contain errors and/or reflect biases from the original data, e.g. Western perspectives are overly represented.
- AI tools will not replace the need for you to develop your own knowledge and skills as an independent learner.

Overview
Data Science and Big Data Analytics are exciting new areas that combine scientific inquiry, statistical knowledge and computer programming.
Organisations are turning to customer data in order to innovate and respond quickly to shifts in the market. Meanwhile, Governments are using to data to help guide policy decisions, making this a prime area for social scientists with an interest in quantitative methods.
This course aims to provide an introduction to the quantitative analysis of data, blending classical statistical methods with recent advances in computational and machine learning. You will cover key topics such as the challenges of analysing big data using statistical methods, and how machine learning and data science can aid in knowledge generation and improve decision-making. You will also explore some of the most exciting frontiers of data science, including large language models, generative AI and “unstructured” data like images and map data.
Engaging with leading faculty, you will cover the main analytical methods from this field and the hands-on application of these methods using example datasets. As a result, the course allows you to gain experience and confidence in using the methods covered during the course in different contexts.
Key information
Prerequisites: Students should be familiar with quantitative methods at an introductory level, up to linear regression analysis, and should be generally comfortable engaging quantitative notation and concepts.

Welcome to the Generative AI Hub, a specially developed resource for Imperial's education community to catch up on the latest developments in the use of generative artificial intelligence across our learning environments.
Several natural language processing models have come to prominence, such as Microsoft Copilot (which all Imperial staff and students have access to), ChatGPT and DeepSeek. These models demonstrate a huge step forward in accessible forms of generative AI which will develop substantially and quickly in the years to come. In fact, they will likely grow to become a tool we use frequently in our everyday lives.
For staff and students, these generative AI models present both opportunities to further improve the quality of our teaching and assessment, as well as various challenges. Knowledge, transparency, and innovation will be key principles driving Imperial's successful interaction with generative AI, as well as debates on and off our campuses about how best it can be applied to real-world scenarios.

Dr Ella McPherson (Deputy Head, Director of Education) and Megan Capon (Education Projects Coordinator), Cambridge School of the Humanities and Social Sciences
We recommend reading the longer-form version of this guidance, which underpins these ideas with academic literature and further explains their rationales.
What is a considerate email culture?
By ‘considerate’, we mean thoughtful and careful with respect to the workload of others, and by ‘culture’, we mean collective values and practices around email-work. The overall aim of this considerate email culture is a manageable level of email workload that facilitates working together while also supporting staff and student well-being (Russell, Jackson, Fullman & Chamakiotis 2023).
At the core of a considerate email culture is a focus on protecting the inboxes of others, displacing or supplementing individualistic mainstream approaches that aim for one’s own ‘inbox zero’ (Landry & Lewiss 2021).
What are considerate email practices?
Thinking about who:
- We should curate addressee lists carefully, only including those who absolutely must receive and/or respond to the information we are sending.
- We should pay attention to automatic replies, thinking twice before sending messages to colleagues who are on annual leave or non-workdays and using automatic replies to communicate our own email boundaries.
- We should be mindful that staff of particular identities (i.e. female staff) and in particular roles (including DUGEs and student administrators) receive a disproportionate amount of emails.
Thinking about what:
- We should prioritise specificity to make our emails as legible as possible, like defining purposes and timeframes in subject lines.
- We should take advantage of email features that clarify and quickly communicate our meanings, such as emojis, when appropriate.
Thinking about when:
- Following on from the ‘right to disconnect’, workplace policies and our own practices should limit emailing out of work hours (Secunda 2019).
- We should adopt ‘no email Friday afternoon’ policies, to give colleagues a chance to wrap up their week’s work and have a predictable chunk of time to dedicate to projects (Bennett 2023).
Thinking about where:
- We should think about where else this communication might effectively happen – could it be saved for a meeting (Twumasi, Cooper & Siegl 2019)?
Thinking about why:
- As email is ‘work about the work’, lots of email traffic might be a symptom, not a cause, of a work problem (Zukas & Malcolm 2017). We should stop to consider why we are sending or receiving a high volume of email in a particular work area.
Thinking about how:
- New technological developments, such as using ChatGPT to co-author emails, might save senders time – but at the expense of recipients, who must decipher a larger volume of less sensical emails.
This considerate email culture guidance is a working document. We welcome feedback on the guidance as well as on your experience consulting on and implementing a considerate email culture locally and experiencing its effects on workload.

Ten ideas on the use of AI to support students in their learning, together with suggested responses for teaching
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can have many creative uses beyond simply generating text in response to prompts in a chat interface. However, many of these come with limitations that are not always immediately obvious. This advice assumes you may already have some experience in using generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Bard or Bing. If not, please refer to our Beyond ChatGPT: The state of generative AI in academic practice report for an exploration of their capabilities.
The activities below may be used in Oxford’s different teaching settings (tutorials, classes, seminars, lectures etc) either before, during or after class, to develop understanding of the opportunities and pitfalls of using generative AI tools in academic practice.
Generative AI tools and plagiarism
Students should be aware that AI tools cannot replace human critical thinking or the development of scholarly evidence-based arguments and subject knowledge that forms the basis of their university education.
Students using AI during their studies must learn and practise the same academic skills of note-taking and clear attribution which are safeguards against plagiarism, ensuring clear differentiation of their own work from any text or material derived from generative AI tools. Unauthorised use of AI falls under the plagiarism regulations and would be subject to academic penalties in summative assessments.
Where the use of generative AI in preparing work for examination has been authorised by the department, faculty or programme, students should give clear acknowledgment of how it has been used in their work.
Ten ideas on the use of generative AI to support students in their learning, together with suggested responses for teaching
1. Where in their learning can students develop an appreciation of the reliability and limitations of generative AI outputs?
Giving students multiple opportunities to critique generative AI outputs in relation to disinformation, fabrication and biased information, can help them assess its roles to assist their learning. Discussion can focus on the care that is needed in using these tools and reinforce the expectations of good academic practice in their studies.
- Consider asking students to generate different prompts to scope the same topic (and/or use a different AI tool) to see how the change in prompt and/or tool impacts the output generated. This iterative approach to designing prompt questions provides opportunities for students to appraise the outputs generated and discuss the limitations of generative AI as the sole tool within their studies.
- Encourage students to review generative AI outputs in terms of information bias, for example, what perspectives are being shared and what are not.
- Ask students to check the outputs for fabrications and false information, for example, can they locate any references cited and/or can they find other sources that validate the outputs, for example, from published papers and texts or assigned reading lists.
2. Where in their learning may students use generative AI to find out about (or get started on) a topic?
Providing opportunities for students to use the appropriate AI tool to quickly scope a topic and then use this information to develop further their own ideas can help them get started in exploring material. Students may benefit from engaging with a wider range of source materials using the ability of some AI tools to translate between a limited range of languages. This allows students to access resources in their first and/or target language.
- Encourage students to use generative AI to scope a topic and bring short summaries of the key points for further discussion and review in class, for example, this could be prompts based on their reading list or other course materials.
- Ask students to use generative AI to identify and translate subject-specific vocabulary into more understandable terms and create a glossary. This can support students in building their understanding when reading academic papers.
- Discuss with students where AI can fail, for example, what aspects of the topic have been omitted, incorrectly reported or referenced, or how contributors from all nationalities, genders, ethnicities or backgrounds may not have been represented.
3. Are there ways in which students may use generative AI to support consolidation of their lecture/practical class/seminar notes?
Students value having the opportunity to organise and structure their study notes effectively into a variety of formats (eg visual, bullet-points, lists, tables, mind-maps). Students can use these outputs to identify gaps in their knowledge and help build their understanding of connections between different topics.
- Consider asking students to use AI tools to consolidate their lecture notes into different formats, for example, in a bullet point list, structure outline, table of key concepts or mind map.
- Drawing on the AI generated outputs, use teaching opportunities to discuss with students what areas might require further clarification and encourage them to synthesise their ideas/knowledge across different topics.
4. Where in their learning could students use generative AI to assess their understanding of a topic?
Students value multiple opportunities to gain immediate feedback on their understanding of a given topic. AI tools can generate open-ended questions and even evaluate a student’s responses. In this way, students can use this approach to identify gaps in their knowledge and focus their study time more effectively.
- Encourage students to use AI to generate practice questions about the subject they study with sample responses to enable them to independently self-assess their understanding of a topic.
- Discuss with students the content of the AI generated output and ask them to review how it changes, depending on the tools and prompts that are used as well as each time they ask the same question.
5. Are there ways in which generative AI can support students to develop their data analysis and research skills?
Giving students opportunities to use generative AI to analyse existing data or explore the properties of data sets, may support them in developing their research and data analysis skills and in getting started with their research. Having discussions with students about the generative AI outputs can augment their own research and data analysis skills.
- Ask students to use generative AI to analyse an existing data set to identify trends and relationships and bring the output to class to discuss and review. Students could be asked to compare their outputs and discuss how they can evaluate the validity of the AI generated analysis as part of developing their own data analysis skills.
- Ask students to use generative AI to build surveys or questionnaires to augment their research skills learning and discuss the outputs in class. For example, explore whether AI can help in generating survey questions based on predefined objectives, suggest ordering of questions and provide ideas on how to improve surveys to maximise user engagement.
6. Are there ways in which generative AI may help develop students’ reading and critical analysis skills?
Providing opportunities for students to review and discuss generative AI generated outputs may support the development of their reading and critical thinking skills.
- Ask students to summarise key texts and then ask AI to generate a summary using language that is easy for them to understand, structured in different ways. Encourage students to discuss how the summaries differ, even when students have given similar prompts to the same tool. You might use teaching time to discuss different ways in which writing alternative presentations can support deeper understanding.
- Ask students to use a generative AI tool to generate some critical questions about a text and compare this output with their own notes and understanding in discussion in class.
7. Where in their learning may students use generative AI to support the development of their academic writing?
Students value opportunities to develop skills and understanding of the basic structure and format of different types of academic writing. Generative AI can support students to improve their academic writing as part of their academic skills development.
- Ask students to use generative AI to generate examples of different types of academic writing or presentations based on the same topic and bring the outputs generated to class to discuss. Students can see how a topic would be presented in an essay format versus an abstract or a poster presentation or a different writing style (students can see how to write for a general audience or a more specialised one).
- Ask students to use generative AI to generate templates or outlines for various essay types, including argumentative, descriptive, expository and narrative. Students might use these as a starting point for their own writing alongside a discussion about good academic practice and appropriate use of AI-generated content in your subject to avoid plagiarism.
8. What are the ways in which students could use generative AI to gain feedback on their writing?
Students value having instant, personalised feedback on their learning, allowing them to understand where they are excelling and where they need to make improvements in their work. Generative AI can give supportive, constructive feedback to help students refine and improve their writing. However, this feedback is not always correct, and students need to be encouraged to use their critical skills to evaluate its appropriateness.
- Encourage students to ask for feedback on examples of their writing from different generative AI tools. Students can ask for suggestions on the structure, coherence and clarity of their writing and use this advice when approaching future writing tasks.
- Remind students that they are encouraged to proof-read their own work, as this is an essential skill in academic writing, and should not use generative AI tools to make material changes to work in draft.
- Ask students in a tutorial or class to develop quizzes using generative AI and complete them. AI can provide immediate feedback, allowing students to understand and correct their mistakes promptly and enrich discussions on common areas of misunderstanding. Students should be encouraged to further validate their answers against another non-AI source as generative AI tools can give erroneous information.
9. Are there ways in which generative AI may enhance students’ learning in class?
Students value opportunities to hear a range of perspectives and AI generated outputs can elicit different viewpoints to those held by the students. It can generate alternative explanations of different contexts, give more examples and suggest analogies. This can serve to enrich and support students in developing their wider contextual understanding of a topic. Generative AI may also support students in understanding instructional texts (including how to guides) by offering opportunities to explore them in multiple formats.
- Consider asking students to seek outputs from generative AI based on a range of discussion topics/questions that you provide (eg same prompt, different generative AI tools, different prompts, same generative AI tool). Use teaching time to facilitate discussions between students in which they question one another on their respective outputs to ascertain and understand the range of perspectives that can be generated through different AI prompts and/or tools.
- Encourage students to use generative AI to research a practical methodology in advance of a laboratory class. This will support them to have a better understanding of why those techniques are used and reflect on the guidance in relation to the formal laboratory teaching protocols and guidance to ensure safe and appropriate practice. This can help build students’ confidence in undertaking experiments and learning about different approaches to experimental design. Importantly, this can enhance students’ engagement with practical work by moving them away from passively following protocols without necessarily understanding the underlying experimental rationale.
10. Can students see examples of how generative AI has been used to support specific skills in language and coding?
Generative AI can support students learning across a range of subjects and develop outputs that range from text-based to non-text-based problems.
- Ask students to engage in written conversations with generative AI in their target language, allowing them to practise real-time interactions. This can be done in class with the students. Alternatively, ask students to do this before class and bring key learning points for discussion to the class, where you can encourage students to identify any errors in the AI generated outputs.
- Consider asking students to create multiple versions of example texts in many languages and ask students to translate them and compare translations or their own writing. Students can take advantage of generative AI’s deep multilingual capabilities to support their language development in multiple ways and multiple levels.
- Ask students to use generative AI to help them describe existing code or identify computer code errors. It can analyse a student's code and provide suggestions for fixing issues. This step-by-step approach promotes a clearer understanding, iterative development, and the value of learning from coding errors. Students can bring the feedback received to class for discussion.

The exhibition currently showcases the work of four PhD students, Chantalle Byron, Jinal Dadiya, Aradhya Sethia, and Kavana Ramaswamy as well as LLM student Omnia Gadalla. Their topics of research and advocacy work cover diverse subjects such as indigenous sovereignty, the rights of women in Egypt in the legal profession, global comparative perspectives outside of western jurisdictions, the interdisciplinary intersections of disability studies and the law, and consideration of fertility care as part of right to health. Equality, diversity, and inclusivity is defined broadly in this showcase to acknowledge that EDI encompasses a multitude of topics and intersects with the law in many different ways.

Only a few programmes have deadlines by which you should apply – decisions are mostly made on a rolling basis, which means that a programme will close once all of the available places have been filled. You must therefore check the current availability of your chosen programme(s) and submit your application early to give yourself the best chance of obtaining a place.
Many scholarships, however, especially for research programmes, have early deadlines. See individual programme pages and the fees and funding page for details of particular deadlines.
Once we have received and processed your application, you should expect to wait an average of 8 weeks for a decision if you are applying for a taught master’s programme. Decisions for research programmes may take longer than this.
Your submitted application will be received and processed by the admissions team only once we have received a reference from each of the referees you nominate in your online application.
Research funding deadlines
Please note: to be considered for LSE PhD Studentships or ESRC Doctoral Training Partnership Scholarships (for 1+3 or +3 funding), you must submit your complete application, including ALL supporting documents, by the following deadlines
- 1 December 2024 (Research programmes in the Law School)
- 18 December 2024 (MRes/PhD Economics and MRes/PhD International Development)
- 15 January 2025 (first funding panel deadline including ESRC) *
- 25 April 2025 Final funding deadline
*Please note: to be considered for ESRC DTP Scholarships you must apply by the first funding panel deadline.
Applications received or completed after the deadline will not be considered for LSE research scholarships. We will always do our best to make sure that applications received just after the deadline reach the departments in time to be considered, but it is much better to plan ahead and submit early.
Please be aware that some departments only make submissions to the earlier funding panels, and earlier applications have more chance of being considered for funding - check individual programme pages for details.
Some programmes will continue to accept applications for places after these deadlines, however it may not be possible to consider you for LSE funding.
Remember that your submitted application cannot be considered until we have received a reference from each of the referees you nominate in your online application.
Previous applicants
If you are unsuccessful, or are unable to take up your place in 2024/5, you have until 16 November 2024 to reinstate your application to be considered in the next admissions cycle for entry in 2025/6. As long as you complete the reinstate form before the deadline, we will re-use the documents that you sent to us, including your transcripts and references. Please note that it is only possible to reinstate your application once, for the following cycle, so if you initially applied before 2024/5, you should start and submit a new application from scratch.
The reinstatement fee is £95.

UCL's general approach to referencing generative AI stipulates AI systems should not be cited as an author nor included as a source in the reference list, but use of generative AI must be acknowledged in an ‘Acknowledgements’ section of any piece of academic work where it has been used as a functional tool to assist in the process of creating academic work.
There may be cases where it is appropriate or necessary for a student or researcher to refer to AI generated output within a piece of work and / or include it in a reference list, e.g. where the piece of work addresses the topic of generative AI and discussion around outputs, where there is reference to a formally published output generated by AI, where it is required by the academic department, or where a student has not identified a primary source of the information despite the issues with relying on generative AI as a secondary source of information (which may be considered poor academic practice). Students are advised to check with their department.
In such cases, the output should be treated as a work with no author, unless specified otherwise by departmental guidelines and based on the ‘Personal communication’ reference type.

The LLM in International Economic Law is designed to provide you with an advanced knowledge and understanding of the international institutions, rules and principles which underpin the contemporary international economic order.
The LLM is suitable not only for students who seek to pursue a legal career in this area, but also those whose interests are intellectual or policy-oriented. The programme will provide you with a sound technical knowledge, and also equip you to think critically about the most pressing legal and policy issues arising from the globalisation of the world economy.
Why study International Economic Law?
During your studies you will be introduced to one of the most significant bodies of rules and institutions involved in constructing and shaping the contemporary international economic order, its boundaries, its relationships with other orders, and its effects.
International economic law is significant not only because it has played a central role facilitating the integration of world markets, but also because it is part of what determines how the gains, risks and losses from integration are distributed, from economic profit to environmental degradation.
International economic law helps to bring developing countries into the global economy – and also to set the terms on which they compete with more established economies. You will learn about why this body of law attracts such strength of both praise and criticism, and why controversies around globalisation, trade, investment and development seem right now to fill the daily newspapers.
Professionally, a sound knowledge of international economic law is increasingly valued by law firms, looking for those with the expertise to provide both technical and strategic advice to international clients with export-oriented businesses, or businesses in more than one country. Those who choose to practice in the specialised areas of trade and investment law will find them both vibrant, interesting and rewarding fields.
Beyond, expertise in the international rules governing the global economy is also valued in careers in the private sector and policy making, at the national and international levels. , where an understanding of international economic law is central to developing effective responses to contemporary business and public challenges
This programme is designed to provide graduates with a range of employment opportunities including:
- legal practice
- government legal service
- legal advisor to non-governmental organisations and private companies
- international civil servants
- specialised researchers in academic and think-tank institutions
- independent consultants
Three pillars: trade, investment and development
The wide range of courses available will enable you to tailor the programme to your areas of professional and personal interest. You will take foundational courses in at least two of the three pillars: international trade law; international investment law, and international development. You will also have the opportunity to select additional subjects from a range of other specialised courses, varying from year to year, and covering topics such as:
- law and sustainable development
- international monetary and financial law
- theoretical aspects of global economic governance
- investment arbitration procedure
- international dispute settlement
- advanced aspects of both trade and investment law.
You will also be able to choose from the specialised courses in others areas of public international law as part of your LLM in International Economic Law.
Across these courses, the goal is to provide you with both a theoretical and practical understanding of the core branches of international economic law, including their underpinning institutional and policy frameworks, as well as a deep knowledge of the contemporary challenges facing this dynamic field. You will develop the critical skills required for independent analysis of international economic legal and policy issues, and of its interactions with other areas of international law. You will also acquire the academic skills required to analyse the activities of international governmental and non-governmental organisations and private actors in the field of international economic law.
The LLM was not only an academically thought-provoking course, but was contemporary and relevant. There was never a dull moment. I credit it for giving me a competitive advantage in my career, and for inspiring me to explore issues of International Law I didn't know about before.
Edinburgh Law School is Scotland’s leading legal research institution, and is host to a large, vibrant and research-active community in international law. We take a research-led approach to teaching and academic staff teaching on our programmes are all experts in their field and involved in cutting-edge research.

Courses listed below are scheduled for the 2025-26 academic year.
Depending on demand, space on specific courses may be limited.
You must take these courses:
WTO Law 1 (20 credits)
The aim of the course is to provide students with an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the multilateral trading system. The course will cover the institutional and the substantive law of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which since its establishment in 1995 has played a central role in, among other things, promoting the two underlying principles of non-discrimination and trade liberalisation. After analysing theoretical and practical arguments for and against free trade and the role of institutions in international trade, the course will then focus on the institutional structure and decision-making process of the WTO, including its unique system of the settlement of trade disputes. Students will then explore the key legal disciplines relating to international trade in goods (GATT) and services (GATS), particularly the principle of non-discrimination and market-access rules. In addition, the course will address the central issue of technical barriers to trade.
International Investment Law (20 credits)
This course will give an introduction to the major themes and issues of international investment law. The focus of study is the rules contained in the network of more than 3000 bilateral and multilateral treaties on investment protection, as well as the growing number of decisions by arbitral tribunals in this field. Students will analyse the substantive principles of investment law, such as most-favoured nation treatment, fair and equitable treatment, and the rules relating to expropriation. They will also study mechanisms for dispute settlement in the context of investment disputes, particularly investor-state arbitration. Throughout the course, students will consider the extent to which international investment law draws an appropriate balance between investment protection on the one hand and the ability of states to regulate on key public policy issues on the other hand. Students will also look at the challenges of developing a coherent regime of investment rules.
Core courses
You must select between 20 and 40 credits from the following courses:
International Investment Arbitration: Theory and Practice (20 credits)
The aim of this course is to further develop students' knowledge of international investment law, and improve both their written and oral advocacy skills in investment arbitration. In so doing, students will have the opportunity to substantiate some of the most important stages of investor-state arbitration proceedings and present written and oral submissions. This practical component of the course will be accompanied by theoretical discussion and analysis of current debates surrounding the reform of investor state dispute settlement.
The course will develop around a mock investor-state dispute, which will be argued by students, as claimants and respondents. To this end students will work in groups in and outside the classroom (this aspect is akin to a preparation for a moot court competition). Students will be expected to read primary and secondary materials and apply these to the specific facts of the mock case.- Law and Development (20 credits)
What, if anything, is development, and what role does law play in its theories and practices?
To answer these questions, the course will consider the history and evolution of some of the major economic theories of development; their translation into diverse political and social policies; and the traces and legacies they have left behind in today's development thinking. It will also consider the ideas about law embedded in these theories and the way they have been put into practice. In particular, the course will explore the role of law and institutions in the creation of markets and the allocation of capital and power.
Optional courses
You must select between 20 and 60 credits from the following courses:
Fundamental Issues in International Law (full-year course, 40 credits)
This is a course aimed at introducing students to fundamental debates about the nature of international law and the international legal order today, and its relationship to states, markets, conflict, justice and human rights. The course is historical, conceptual, theoretical and legal. It introduces students to key ideas and arguments about where the international legal order is coming from and where it is going, what its building blocks are, and how those components are changing. A theme uniting the course is the extent to which the international legal order is shifting from a classical jus inter gentes to something else: a law of global governance, a global administrative law, a law of rights and regulation, or some combination.
- Energy Transition and the International Economic Legal Order: Governance, Challenges and Innovations (20 credits)
The global energy transition is not just a technological or social challenge; it is deeply embedded in international legal frameworks governing trade, investment, and finance. This course examines how international economic law (as well as, to an extent, international environmental law) shapes decarbonisation efforts, from treaty-making and dispute resolution to regulatory innovations in energy markets. Students will explore legal mechanisms for attracting renewable energy investment, phasing out fossil fuels, managing critical materials, and aligning international economic law rules with climate objectives¿gaining insight into the governance challenges at the heart of the energy transition.
- New Perspectives on International Law and the Environment (20 credits)
International law and governance mechanisms have not managed to avert the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. This course will introduce students to diverse alternative perspectives that have been proposed to remedy some of these systemic failings, and critically reflect on their potential and limitations.
- International Political Economy (20 credits)
This option introduces the main schools of thinking about International Political Economy by focusing upon the patterns of evolution in the global political economy since the Second World War. The course considers the main theoretical approaches to understanding IPE, before considering the subject areas of trade, transnational corporations, international finance, development, globalisation and regionalisation. It is designed for students with no prior experience of the subject or of economics.
You will have the option to take between 0 and 40 credits of courses from different subject areas offered by the Law School, depending on availability and with the express permission of the Programme Director. Depending on demand, space on courses outside the core courses may be limited.
Full programme details, including core and optional courses is available on the University Degree Programme Tables website.
View 2025-26 programme information for the LLM in International Economic Law
Having successfully completed 120 credit points of courses within the LLM, you will be ready to move onto a single piece of independent and in-depth research. The 10,000 word dissertation allows you to focus on a preferred topic from within the field of international economic law, normally based on a subject you have studied in one of your courses during the programme.
You will be assigned an academic dissertation supervisor who will provide you with support and guidance while you prepare and write your dissertation.
The dissertation is a challenging but rewarding endeavour, asking you to demonstrate a comprehensive grasp of the relevant literature and an ability to engage critically with a range of sources, drawing on the skills and knowledge you have developed during the course of the programme. Students are encouraged to show originality and evidence of independent thinking, whether in terms of the material used, or the manner in which it is presented.
The dissertation is written in the summer months (April to August) after the taught courses are successfully completed.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.

Ara Lee studied the LLM in International Economic Law in the academic year 2019-20, graduating in 2020.
When I was in Japan as an exchange student, I was fascinated by a course called International Economic Law. However, unfortunately, I got a job in a completely different field for a living after graduating from university. One day, I decided that if I did not take the step to study what I have a keen interest in, I would live to regret it. Therefore, I quit my job and decided to go back to study.
This outstanding LLM programme specialising in International Economic Law caught my eye among numerous programmes and it brought me to the University of Edinburgh. It was no easy option for me but I learned tremendous things in my area of study from fantastic academic staff.
The courses in this programme address not only fundamentals but also contemporary issues in this field such as Advanced Issues in International Economic Law. Moreover, certain courses provide practical applications including International Investment Arbitration: Theory and Practice.
Throughout my whole Edinburgh life, I have felt the full support from academic staff, especially my personal tutor and supervisor. Under the supervision of the faculty, I have developed considerable abilities to conduct research independently and tackle International Economic Law issues.
Apart from the programme itself, students can get involved in extracurricular activities via various events, fairs, or societies. I participated in a team preparing for the WTO Moot Court held by the European Law Students' Association. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, literally.
I hope you also enjoy this marvellous opportunity, both personally and professionally.
Kaoru, a student from Japan, studied the LLM in International Economic Law in the 2018-19 academic year, graduating in 2019. In this video he talks about his experience of studying for an LLM at Edinburgh Law School and his time in Edinburgh.
Ekin, a student from Turkey, studied the LLM in International Economic Law at Edinburgh Law School and graduated in 2019. In this video she talks about her experience on the programme and life in Edinburgh.
Yining, a student from China, talks about her experience of studying the LLM in International Economic Law at Edinburgh Law School.
Prior to the LLM program I successfully achieved a Bachelor in Law degree at Saint-Louis University Brussels as well as a two-year Master in Law degree at the KU Leuven.
As I wished to further specialise in international economic law, WTO and EU trade law in particular, I decided to pursue an LLM degree in this field. As a top-class university in Europe, Edinburgh was amongst the institutions topping my list.
Overall the programme was of a satisfying level. Some courses I enjoyed more than others, as is to be expected. Without a doubt, the two courses taught by Professor Andrew Lang were my favourites. Not only were those courses (WTO law and Advanced issues in international economic law) those I most wanted to attend given my wish to specialise in that area of law, but also Professor Lang's combination of passion for the topics taught and his very high-level understanding of the law and capacity to question it, made the courses enjoyable with the added-value I was expecting from LLM courses.
As far as the others courses are concerned, I enjoyed them a little less given I had less of a peak-interest in them. That being said, in all courses I enjoyed the challenge of the written assessments.
Edinburgh has a lot to offer. This hold true for more cultural and historical aspects with many museums and historical buildings, as well as for more social sides with plenty of pubs and clubs (though they close quite early). Besides the lovely historical side of the city that I much enjoyed going for a walk in, nature and the magnificent Highlands are just a bit outside the city. Scotland's nature is truly breath-taking and definitely one of the many more enjoyable sides of it (especially if enjoyed with a rare ray of sunshine).
I would certainly recommend the programme. As with any other institution, it is not perfect but there is a noticeable commitment to continue to improve. Plus, the building is awesome.
Importantly for me, my choice was not primarily based on academic aspects. Edinburgh Law School stands its ground amongst the top Law Schools in Europe, so I made my decision to come to Edinburgh on those elements surrounding the law school and the program and that made a difference with other law schools. And in this regard, the commitment from the Law School as well as the city itself and nature around it did play an important part.
At the moment I am undertaking an internship in International Trade Law at an international law firm in Brussels, thus continuing on the path of my LLM where I focused on this area of law. Next up is most probably taking the Bar in Brussels. And then, we will see what comes next.
""I really enjoyed being a student on the LLM in International Economic Law as it provided an amazing learning experience during the full year of study.
In addition to practical cases in daily class exercises, leading tutors and special guests in this field imparted knowledge and guided us in humorous and informative approaches which not only taught you how to learn ""law on books"" but also how to think critically in legal practice.

Programme website: International Banking Law and Finance
I'm really happy that I chose to study this programme as it not only provides extensive knowledge of the financial sector but also addresses current issues such as Fintech. All of the lecturers are experts in the field, so you know you're learning from the best.
Banking and finance underpins global markets that impact on the day to day activities of businesses and individuals around the world. To work in this high paced legal environment, you are expected to have developed a clear understanding of the regulation and practice of banking at national, supranational and international levels. The LLM in International Banking Law and Finance at Edinburgh Law School caters to those needs.
The principal aim of the LLM in International Banking Law and Finance is to provide postgraduate students with the opportunity for specialised advanced learning in certain key areas of banking and financial law and practice. The programme is forward thinking, considering emerging and developing technologies and their implications on the practice of banking and financing transactions.
The length of courses over one or two semesters plays a key role in fostering deep learning, enabling you to explore a wider variety of subjects in greater depth. You will enjoy significant flexibility in your course choices and can tailor your study to your needs and interests.
The main programme aims are to develop specialist knowledge in banking and finance law and practice, to foster independence of thought, critical reflection and the development of scholarly writing skills at an advanced level in law.
Specifically, this highly specialised LLM programme is suitable for ambitious students and professionals who aspire to pursue a successful career in the field of global financial markets and especially in the areas of:
- finance
- banking
- capital markets
- corporate finance
- financial technology
- accounting and law firms
It is also suitable for those who wish to pursue a successful career with regulatory authorities, central banks, and other public sector organisations. It will help you position yourself as a highly-skilled expert and future leader in the wider area of global financial markets, banking and finance law and regulation.
To enhance and broaden your professional prospects and horizons, some of the seminars in the programme are delivered by leading finance law practitioners/policymakers. This enables the programme to provide you with a good blend of theory and practical expertise.
A successful career in today’s global markets requires an extensive and in-depth knowledge of complex and sophisticated global and domestic finance laws, regulations and practices. This skillset may not be developed without extensive study and a solid understanding of the economic, financial, legal and regulatory theories and practices supporting the operation of global finance.
Based on the University of Edinburgh's strong law and finance expertise, the programme offers interdisciplinary, law and practice-oriented courses examining the legal, economic and political aspects of banking, corporate finance and the relevant regulatory frameworks at national, European and international levels. It also utilises key experience from practice to help you develop practical, problem-solving and drafting skills to handle complex policy, compliance, transaction structuring and completion challenges.
We pride ourselves on delivering intensive, high-quality teaching in small-group settings. This gives you the opportunity to study in detail the topics and subjects above through intellectually rigorous discussions guided by leading academics, including opportunities for feedback.
Seminars are challenging and students regularly present on seminar topics as well as engage in real-life or hypothetical case studies. Through frequent group presentations and by means of testing case studies, prepared and presented collectively by programme students, and students’ own study (revision) groups, you will benefit from the cross-fertilisation of different ideas and experiences. This approach facilitates critical discussion, and enables you to hone your problem-solving, presentation, and team-building skills.
Previous students have had the opportunity to attend guest lectures from high-profile speakers ranging from top regulators, including the European Central Bank and the Prudential Regulation Authority, to highly respected law professors, outstanding economists and lawyers.
This programme can be studied full time over one year, consists of 180 credits, comprising taught courses worth 120 credits (60 credits per semester) and a 10,000 word dissertation worth 60 credits.

Programme website: Intellectual Property Law
The LLM in IP Law has brilliant lecturers, wonderfully designed courses, stimulating 'intellectual' discussions, and students from all around the world.
This programme is designed to equip you with an advanced knowledge and understanding of intellectual property law and policy within a domestic (UK), regional (European) and international setting.
It will facilitate learning of both substantive intellectual property law, and the place and role of intellectual property, not just in its legal context but also in its social, ethical, cultural and commercial contexts.
The core courses will cover substantive law on all major intellectual property rights including:
- patents
- copyright
- trademarks
- designs
- common law protection of intellectual property rights
Courses also provide a critical understanding of topical issues and a broad range of perspectives on intellectual property law, practice and policy.
You must complete 180 credits of study - 60 credits are taken in the compulsory dissertation and the remaining 120 credits are taken in taught courses (of which a minimum of 80 credits must be taken from a list of core courses in intellectual property).
Courses will be led by members of the Law School academic community, who are leaders in their field.
You are expected to prepare in advance by reading the required materials and by reflecting on the issues to be discussed.
For the dissertation you will have a supervisor from whom you can expect guidance and support, but the purpose of the dissertation is to allow you to independently design and conduct a piece of research and analysis.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.

We link to the latest information available. Please note that this may be for a previous academic year and should be considered indicative.
The subjects of the degree are intended to equip you with both an advanced knowledge of substantive intellectual property law and of the place and role of intellectual property within a domestic, regional and international context, laying a foundation for a specialised dissertation.
By the end of your studies for this degree, you will have acquired a high level of knowledge in the field of intellectual property law, a sophisticated awareness of the problems in the area and of the differing approaches to their solution.
Having studied the programme, you will emerge with an understanding of intellectual property law, not just in its legal but also social, ethical, cultural and commercial contexts.
During your study you will have access to the results of innovative cross-cutting research of the highest quality. The programme is suitable to prepare you for advanced research.
This programme provides excellent preparation for anyone seeking to work in intellectual property in a legal, business, industry, policy or academic setting, or who wishes to advance their knowledge in the field.
Recent graduates have entered legal practice as specialists in intellectual property law, and are also working in a range of areas such as the creative industries, information technology and life sciences.
These entry requirements are for the 2025/26 academic year and requirements for future academic years may differ. Entry requirements for the 2026/27 academic year will be published on 1 Oct 2025.

Generative AI tools are a type of software that automatically generate content based on questions or prompts input by the user. They include ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot, among many others. Tools can generate text, code, images, and other types of content. Generative AI tools that deal with text are also called Large Language Models, or LLMs and continuously build a ‘knowledge base’ of information by collecting users’ previous questions or prompts as its base of data. Generative AI tools can be appealing to use in that they can provide or create content quickly but have limitations for use in any academic work in that that the outputs may not be wholly reliable.

Considerations for use of generative AI tools
There is no agreed AI Literacy framework yet in the Higher Education sector to outline necessary skills and competencies for students and academics when using these tools. Library Services has compiled a list of considerations below for the use of generative AI tools.
These considerations are organised according to the continuum of information use and management the library supports. They are not intended to be exhaustive. For further information consult your course team or tutor and your Subject Librarian. Imperial's Academic Misconduct Policy and Procedure addresses the use of generative AI tools and academic integrity should be understood to encompass appropriate use of these tools.

Programme website: Intellectual Property Law
The LLM in IP Law has brilliant lecturers, wonderfully designed courses, stimulating 'intellectual' discussions, and students from all around the world.
This programme is designed to equip you with an advanced knowledge and understanding of intellectual property law and policy within a domestic (UK), regional (European) and international setting.
It will facilitate learning of both substantive intellectual property law, and the place and role of intellectual property, not just in its legal context but also in its social, ethical, cultural and commercial contexts.
The core courses will cover substantive law on all major intellectual property rights including:
- patents
- copyright
- trademarks
- designs
- common law protection of intellectual property rights
Courses also provide a critical understanding of topical issues and a broad range of perspectives on intellectual property law, practice and policy.
You must complete 180 credits of study - 60 credits are taken in the compulsory dissertation and the remaining 120 credits are taken in taught courses (of which a minimum of 80 credits must be taken from a list of core courses in intellectual property).
Courses will be led by members of the Law School academic community, who are leaders in their field.
You are expected to prepare in advance by reading the required materials and by reflecting on the issues to be discussed.
For the dissertation you will have a supervisor from whom you can expect guidance and support, but the purpose of the dissertation is to allow you to independently design and conduct a piece of research and analysis.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.
Find out more about compulsory and optional courses
We link to the latest information available. Please note that this may be for a previous academic year and should be considered indicative.
The subjects of the degree are intended to equip you with both an advanced knowledge of substantive intellectual property law and of the place and role of intellectual property within a domestic, regional and international context, laying a foundation for a specialised dissertation.
By the end of your studies for this degree, you will have acquired a high level of knowledge in the field of intellectual property law, a sophisticated awareness of the problems in the area and of the differing approaches to their solution.
Having studied the programme, you will emerge with an understanding of intellectual property law, not just in its legal but also social, ethical, cultural and commercial contexts.
During your study you will have access to the results of innovative cross-cutting research of the highest quality. The programme is suitable to prepare you for advanced research.
This programme provides excellent preparation for anyone seeking to work in intellectual property in a legal, business, industry, policy or academic setting, or who wishes to advance their knowledge in the field.
Recent graduates have entered legal practice as specialists in intellectual property law, and are also working in a range of areas such as the creative industries, information technology and life sciences.
These entry requirements are for the 2025/26 academic year and requirements for future academic years may differ. Entry requirements for the 2026/27 academic year will be published on 1 Oct 2025.

Information on Degree Program
Robotics is being transformed: whereas previously automatized industrial robots were principally used in production processes, today they have entered into many areas of life. They have left the factories and now encounter people in their everyday lives.
Whereas previously, specialists had to service them, today this can be done by anyone: thus robots do the vacuum cleaning at home or mow the lawn. Further still, people and robots cooperate more and more closely, without any walls between them. Tomorrow, robots will be both part of everyday life and of the human body. After all, today, wearable robotic exoskeletons already help paralyzed people to walk. As the distinctions between humans and machines blur, robotics developers are faced with new challenges. Robots must be able to react autonomously to unforeseen situations and to adapt. It is impossible to foresee every interaction and every action in advance, and to program accordingly. Therefore, through the use of artificial intelligence, robots too have to be able to learn.
The “Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence” Master’s program is a joint program of the Departments of Informatics, Electrical Engineering, and Information Technology as well as Mechanical Engineering – it provides the basis upon which to participate in these fascinating developments.
As a graduate, you will have acquired a broad methodological and theoretical grasp of the foundations of robotics, cognition, and intelligent autonomous systems. In addition to informatics, you are also familiar with those aspects of electrical and mechanical engineering relevant to you.
You possess knowledge of classic robot control systems as well as of the areas of perception, image processing, and artificial intelligence. You are familiar with procedures relating to signal processing; sensory data analysis and fusion; and programming. You have a firm grasp of behavioral control as well as machine learning and human-robot interaction. Through cooperation with industry partners, you will have been able to gain your first experience of practice-led projects.
The broad spectrum of elective modules will have enabled you to create an individual competency profile.
Opportunities for graduates of the Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence master's program arise in research and industry. By way of example, career opportunities open up in aviation and aerospace, microelectronics, consumer electronics, biomedical engineering, or the automotive sector.

Below you will find focus areas in the research field ""Human-Centered Security and Privacy"" for which we offer Bachelor's and Master's theses. For a specific topic and any questions about these focus areas, please contact the relevant person.
The rapid development of digital technologies and the increasing threat of cybersecurity have led to a growing need for innovative security solutions in public spaces. One example of user interfaces that can improve security behavior are so-called Public Security User Interfaces. These are interfaces positioned in shared, non-personal areas that offer information or interactions on security-related topics. These interfaces play an important role in providing security information, improving situational awareness, and promoting secure behavior. The main goal of this research is to investigate the design, implementation, and impact of user interfaces that enhance security behavior, in order to facilitate the transition from cybersecurity awareness to habitual secure behavior.
The theses in this area deal with topics such as:
Interested students are asked to submit their CV, academic transcript, and intended start date.

Cybercrime currently causes a global economic loss amounting to several trillion euros. According to expert analyses, up to 90% of these damages are a direct or indirect result of attacks in which the human element is at the center. Attackers exploit authority, fear, curiosity, or helpfulness with the goal of manipulating their victims to obtain sensitive data. Examples include phone calls to obtain user login credentials, emails containing malware attachments to gain access to protected networks, or deep fakes used to impersonate someone's identity.
Theses in this area address a variety of questions:

Mixed reality devices are quickly finding their way into usersâ daily lives, particularly in the form of head-mounted displays. Users can immerse themselves in virtual worlds or enrich the virtual world with physical content, supporting a wide range of applications in the areas of entertainment, work, education, and well-being. While these technologies support an ever-increasing number of features in the aforementioned areas, they also present challenges and create opportunities for security and privacy.
Theses in this area essentially deal with topics in the context of two general questions: (1) How can mixed reality solve existing challenges in terms of privacy and security? (2) What challenges in terms of privacy and security arise in the context of mixed reality, and how can these be addressed?

The rapid integration of wearable sensors and head-mounted displays (HMDs) makes on-body computing increasingly relevant for security and privacy research. In this area, we focus on biometric authentication, privacy-preserving wearables, physiological sensing, and secure interaction paradigms for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Possible topics include the development of novel authentication methods for wearable devices, privacy-preserving approaches to continuous physiological monitoring, secure interaction concepts in AR and VR environments, and adaptive security/privacy mechanisms that enhance user trust and system reliability. By addressing current challenges and future opportunities, we aim to develop resilient, privacy-conscious, and user-friendly on-body systems that prioritize both security and seamless interaction experiences.

In the age of ubiquitous computing, users' IT security and privacy are at risk almost anytime. IT security and privacy assistants help users become aware of these risks and take appropriate measures to protect their data. However, these systems are often too complex, unintuitive, and not visually appealing. In order to enable even less technologically savvy or inexperienced individuals to use IT security and privacy assistants, such mechanisms must become tangible, i.e., physically manipulable and touchable by humans.
Sarah Delgado Rodriguez
The use of biometric mechanismsâi.e., authentication based on unique features of a user's physiology or behaviorâis a convenient and fast alternative to classical token- or knowledge-based authentication. Popular examples include fingerprint, facial recognition, or typing behavior biometrics. However, these systems typically rely on machine learning algorithms, making their decisions both difficult for the user to comprehend and subject to manipulation.
In this research area, we investigate novel approaches that enable users to understand and influence the results of biometric (black-box) systems, and develop new approaches with a focus on the user.
The following questions are particularly interesting:
Concrete research approaches include, among others, investigating (real) user behavior (e.g., through observations, interviews, surveys) and designing, implementing, and evaluating novel security and privacy concepts.
Reauthentication Concepts for Biometric Authentication Systems on Mobile Devices

The increased use of generative models has elevated human-AI collaboration to new heights. Although there has been extensive research on the evaluation metrics of generative models, these have not yet been leveraged for human exploration of the latent space of such models. Exploring latent spaces remains a significant challenge, particularly in terms of how users interact with these spaces through different user interfaces. This work investigates the influence of user interfaces on usersâ exploration of generative model latent spaces, aiming to develop more intuitive and effective exploration tools. Specifically, in this thesis, we aim to build a visualization tool for understanding the metrics related to GANs' latent spaceâcapturing how users explore, navigate, and engage with generative outputs. By focusing on UI design and interaction, this work sheds light on user-centric exploration patterns and provides practical insights for designing accessible and engaging interfaces. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of user interaction with generative models and facilitate their broader adoption and application across various domains.
In this thesis, we explore how small, interactive elements - like inline widgets - can help shape the way a story unfolds. For example, a character widget might let an author edit a character's traits, and those changes could automatically adjust how that character acts across the story. Instead of building a complete storytelling system, our focus is on design concept that support writers as they work. This concept will allow edits to specific parts of the storyâlike a character or settingâto ripple out and influence the broader narrative when needed. By making it easier to see and control how local changes affect the big picture, this approach helps writers stay flexible, creative, and in control of their stories.
Electrodermal activity (EDA) denotes the measurement of continuous changes in the electrical conductance properties of the skin in response to sweat secretion by the sweat glands. EDA is autonomously modulated by sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, a component of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is involved in the control of involuntary bodily functions as well as cognitive and emotional states. Specifically, phasic EDA activity correlated with stress, cognitive load, and attention orienting. Therefore, measuring phasic EDA responses can give us information about the user's state.In this thesis project, we want to develop an adaptive system that modifies the visual complexity of the VR environment based on changes in phasic EDA. Specifically, we want to use new signal processing methodologies termed adaptive thresholding and gaussian filtering.The research consists of three main stages: (1) validation of the psychophysiological inference underpinning the adaptive system (2) implementation of a working VR prototype, and (3) an evaluation of the adaptive environment.
Mixed reality (MR) systems refer to the entire broad spectrum that ranges from physical to virtual reality (VR). It includes instances that overlay virtual content on physical information, i.e., Augmented Reality (AR), and those that rely on physical content to increase the realism of virtual environments, i.e., Augmented Virtuality (AV). Such instances tend to be pre-defined for the blend of physical and virtual content. To what extent can MR systems rely on physiological inputs to infer user state and expectations and, in doing, adapt their visualization in response? Measurement sensors for eye and body motion, autonomic arousal (e.g., respiration, electrodermaland heart activity), and cortical activity (e.g., EEG, fNIRS) are widely used in psychological and neuroscience research to infer hidden user states, such as stress, overt/covert attention, working memory load, etc.However, it is unclear if such inferences can serve as useful real-time inputs in controlling the presentation parameters of MR environments.In this thesis project, we will investigate whether this blend can be adaptive to user states, which are inferred from physiological measurements derived from gaze behavior, peripheral physiology (e.g.., electrodermal activity (EDA); electrocardiography (ECG)), and cortical activity (i.e.., electroencephalography (EEG)). In other words, we will investigate the viability and usefulness of MR use scenarios that vary in their blend of virtual and physicalcontent according to user physiology. In particular, we will focus on understanding how physiological readings can passively determine the appropriate amount ofvisual information to present within an MR system.
Biocybernetic adaptation is a form of physiological computing where real-time physiological data from the brain and the body can be used as an input to adapt the user interface. In this way, from the physiological data, we can infer the userâs state and design implicit interactions in VR to change the scene to support certain goals. This thesis aims the develop and evaluate an adaptive VR environment designed to maximize users' performance by exploiting changes in real-time electroencephalography (EEG) to adjust the level of visual complexity. The research consists of three main stages: (1) validation of the input EEG measures underpinning the loop; (2) implementation of a working VR prototype; and (3) an evaluation of the adaptive environment. Specifically, we aim to demonstrate the sensitivity of EEG power in the (frontal) theta and (parietal) alpha bands to adapt levels of visual complexity.
Research from cognitive science and computerized displays of simple stimuli has shown how perceptual load is a critical factor for modulating distraction. Perceptual load is the amount of information involved in processing task stimuli. According to Lavie (1995), our attentional resources are limited and mainly directed towards task-relevant goals, but we might be more prone to distractors if we have cognitive spare resources. Previous research showed that human faces have bigger distracting power than non-face objects. This project aims to assess the distracting potential distracting effect of human avatars in a social VR scenario. We aim to transfer of traditional paradigms that assess attention and distraction to immersive VR. Lastly, we adapt the target-distractor recognizability to evaluate if a physiologically-adaptive system that optimizes for perceptual load can support task performance. The research consists of three main stages: (1) validation of the psychophysiological inference underpinning the physiological loop (2) implementation of a working VR prototype, and (3) an evaluation of the adaptive environment.
Physiological computing is a multidisciplinary research field in HCI wherein the interaction depends on measuring and responding to the user's physiological activity in real-time (Fairclough, 2009). Physiological computing allows for implicit interaction; by monitoring the physiological signals of the user, the computer can infer, e.g., if the task demands are either too challenging or easy, and either adapt the difficulty level or when users are getting distracted from the task, the system could give them a notification. Measuring the psychological state of the user creates intriguing possibilities for Social VR scenarios as we can either adapt the number of displayed avatars, their form or even their proxemic distance. This thesis aims the develop an adaptive Social VR environment designed to support users' performance when engaged in a cognitive task using a measure of physiological state (electrodermal activity: EDA) as input for adaptation. The research consists of three main stages: (1) validation of the psychophysiological inference underpinning the physiological loop (2) implementation of a working VR prototype, and (3) an evaluation of the adaptive environment.
Prior work has explored transition visualizations between VR environments, or on specific interaction techniques for transferring objects from VR AR views. However, there has been less attention on what are the more effective transitions across the reality-virtuality continuum. The focus of this work would be to (a) identify suitable MR transitions (b) create a mapping to common tasks where such transitions may be applicable (e.g., keyboard typing) (c) prototype different transitions, from R-->AR-->AV--VR, and vice versa: VR-->AV-->AR--R, and empirically investigating different parameters of each (d) run a user evaluation to assess perceived UX. comfort, sickness, etc. This project extends the work in Keep it simple? Evaluation of Transitions VR, by exploring MR transitions, instead of only across different VR environments. Evaluation metrics will involve both objective and subjective measures.
RQ1: What are the most effective methods for transitioning users across the reality-virtuality spectrum?
RQ2: How do these transition visualizations influence user experience, user physiological state, workload, and acceptance across tasks?
Join a hands-on research project exploring how Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) can help users better understand abstract cybersecurity topics like Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)! TUIs have shown promise in making complex topics more accessible â but can they help people grasp protocols like BB84? We've built a marble-track-based prototype to find out, and now it's time to evaluate it in a user study. This topic offers a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experiences with UX research, a highly demanded skill in- and outside of academia.
Your task: Design and conduct a laboratory study to empirically evaluate the TUI, and analyse the data collected during an intensive 6-week practical course (to start as soon as possible).
Project Overview This thesis project presents a unique opportunity for students to contribute to innovative research on adaptive RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) systems, following up from [1]. The focus is on developing an intelligent RSVP system that adapts to user attention and cognitive load by leveraging pupil dilation data. Pupil dilation has been shown to correlate with cognitive processing, providing valuable insight into the user's mental state while reading or processing visual stimuli. By incorporating this biometric feedback into the RSVP system, the project aims to create a more intuitive and personalized reading experience, especially for users with attention challenges or disabilities.
Traditional RSVP systems often rely on fixed speeds or manual adjustments, which may not suit every user's cognitive capacity. This project seeks to enhance user engagement and efficiency by using real-time pupil dilation data to adjust the speed and presentation style dynamically. By doing so, the RSVP system can become more responsive to individual reading habits, reducing cognitive overload and improving comprehension and retention of information. This work has important implications for accessibility, enabling better interaction for users with reading difficulties or neurological impairments.
This thesis will explore the development and evaluation of an adaptive RSVP system, with a focus on the following key objectives:
Project OverviewThis thesis project offers an exciting opportunity for students to contribute to cutting-edge research on gaze estimation in interactive systems. The focus is on enhancing the accuracy of gaze interpretation within Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs), where effective communication is often dependent on understanding where participants are looking. Gaze serves as a vital non-verbal communication cue, yet people frequently struggle to accurately determine another persons gaze direction (i.e., where someone is looking), especially over distances.
Probes are a powerful and widely used method in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and related disciplines such as social sciences. They enable researchers to gather rich, contextual insights into participantsâ lived experiences, uncovering underlying needs, emotions, intentions, and desires. By prompting participants to repeatedly reflect on and document specific aspects of their daily lives â often in the form of diary entries â researchers can gain a nuanced, reliable understanding of what truly matters to participants. This depth of insight is essential for the design of applications that are not only user-centered but also contextually relevant and personally meaningful.
It is inherent that probes are easy and engaging for the participants, while at the same time they are supposed to include multiple data types, such as written text, photos, log data, drawings, audio or video recordings and individual designs. With the growing importance of context-adaptive applications, there is an increasing need to investigate well-defined situations based on human and environmental context factors (e.g., location, activity, intentions, cognitive states, and emotions). Existing tools often lack the ability to effectively prompt participants to respond within these specific contexts.
The objective of this thesis is to design and develop a mobile application that functions as an innovative and engaging probe tool. It should support the collection of diverse data formats, including photos, videos, audio, and creative user inputs such as sketches or prototypes. Additionally, the application should utilize contextual triggers (e.g., location data, physiological data from smartwatches) to send timely notifications prompting users to provide input.
Please note that the scope and complexity of this project are more appropriate for a Masterâs thesis. However, exceptionally qualified Bachelorâs studentsâbased on academic transcript, motivation, or relevant experienceâare also welcome to apply.
Interested students are invited to submit their CV, academic transcript, and intended start date to dominik.hirschberg ät .
This thesis builds upon a previous master's thesis on online action learning and aims to improve the approach by integrating both online and offline action detection. The goal is to refine the system to better detect when a robot should exhibit curiosity based on human activity. Improvements will focus on optimizing classification accuracy, reducing latency, and enhancing adaptability. Additionally, a user study will be conducted to evaluate the system's effectiveness in real-world human-robot interaction scenarios.

This thesis explores how aggressive behavior toward robots, such as kicking or yelling, affects subsequent human-human interaction. While prior research has investigated verbal aggression directed at voice assistants ([1]), this project shifts the focus to physical robots in shared environments. The central question is: Does being mean to a robot influence how people behave with each other afterward?
Using a robot platform, the thesis will design controlled interaction scenarios where participants engage in socially inappropriate behavior toward a robot. We will then measure how this behavior impacts their social dynamics with human partners, aiming to uncover emotional, behavioral, or communicative changes.
Non-Verbal communication is a non-intrusive way for robots to communicate with users. However, how robot gestures are understood by users is not directly clear. In this thesis, you will apply the Expression Elicitation approach to develop non-verbal, understandable expressions for a vacuum robot operating in a domestic environment. The goal is to enable the robot to clearly communicate its current goals and needs without relying on sound. Scenarios may include the robot signaling which room it plans to clean next, indicating that an object is blocking its path, or expressing that it needs to recharge.
In this thesis, we aim to elicit non-verbal expressions for a semi-humanoid robot to enhance its on-task communication. Applying the expression elicitation approach ([1]), the goal is to develop a set of understandable expressions for task-related interactions. These expressions may include showing curiosity, interrupting to correct mistakes, or signaling attentiveness.
For human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems, it is important to understand and quantify usersâ perceptions to make the next predictions inline with the userâs intention. HITL systems that employ visual recognition often require inferring similarity between a percieved object and a mental targed. This is often difficult to determine when it comes to complex stimuli like faces. While HITL systems traditionally rely on explicit user input, implicit EEG responses can support the decision-making process effortlessly.
In this project, we will be exploring brain signals (more accurately, ERP components) in similariy prediction for visual stimuli.
There has been rapid development in technologies that aim to support the needs of neurodivergent individuals in navigating everyday life and improving their wellbeing. Addressing the differences in perception and cognition, multiple mechanisms are available to ease self regulation, focus improvement and stress management. One very promising approach is neurofeedback - a method of brain tracking in connection to a specific activity. In the past, this non invasive method used to be practiced in a lab, with the assistance of a professional. However, nowadays there are tracking opportunities via consumer devices that can be done in the comfort of one's home. We would like to investigate the need for these devices and in which context could they provide maximum support to suit the needs of neurodivergent individuals.
In this project, you will find a scenario to inspect the usefulness and improvement of brain tracking for neurodivergent individuals
As VR technologies become increasingly embedded in everyday life, concerns around privacy and data collection grow more pressing.

This project is a collaboration with a Munich-based artist Philip Gröning and part of a larger initiative.
The objective of this project is to create a camera-based system to predict wave movements and identify the calmest surface point on a defined, square water body. This system will employ computer vision techniques, specifically optical flow, to track wave motion across video frames. Machine learning models will be utilized to predict future wave behavior, consistently detecting regions with minimal motion, representing calm areas. The calmest point will serve as the primary output and will be forwarded to a 7-axis robotic arm. The project includes real-time video processing, optical flow analysis, and machine learning for wave pattern forecasting.
This project offers practical experience in computer vision and machine learning applied to a real-world problem, making it ideal for students interested in AI, robotics, environmental monitoring, and computational fluid dynamics. As part of a larger art project, an interest in the creative domain is beneficial but not mandatory.

Supervisor: Clara Sayffaerth (clara.sayffaerth@)
This project aims to explore how different Extended Reality (XR) visualizations of an expert's perspective impact learning and memory retention. With more people retiring from the workforce than entering it, combined with the rapid evolution of technology, transferring practical and procedural knowledge has become increasingly challenging. Currently, this transfer often relies on in-person demonstrations, which can be limiting. XR technology offers solutions by enabling learning that is not restricted by time or place while also presenting information in an immersive, three-dimensional way. Additionally, XR allows us to visually adapt reality. By experimenting with how a virtual expert is visualized, we can go beyond replicating realistic instructions. These adaptations have the potential to enhance the learning experience and improve knowledge transfer for future learners.

This project focuses on exploring how virtual agents and avatars can support people in outdoor settings through XR (Extended Reality) technologies. While XR applications like AR and VR have been widely studied in controlled lab environments, there is still limited knowledge about how people interact with virtual agents in the wild, especially in public outdoor contexts like city tours, educational walks, or outdoor navigation. At the same time, there is growing interest in leveraging XR head-mounted displays (HMDs) for real-world guidance and learning. Virtual agents or avatars offer a promising way to deliver instructions, provide information, and support users during their outdoor activities. However, designing and evaluating systems in these realistic, unpredictable environments raises new challenges around usability, social acceptance, and technical robustness. This project aims to address the research gap by designing, deploying, and studying XR-based agent interactions in outdoor public spaces.
Today's world is shaped by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) more than by any other technology. In a rush to be early adopters, companies try to include genAI in their products, neglecting their users' need for agency, control, and trust. We propose a layered approach to give users control over whether they want to use genAI and to what degree: (1) genAI is completely disabled, (2) a locally hosted AI model is employed, and (3) the model has access to the internet. As tangible interfaces have proven to increase trust when it comes to privacy & security, we developed several tangible control mechanisms for users to switch between the different stages and evaluated them in an explorative study.
In this bachelors thesis, you will explore the design space of tangible interfaces for controlling generative AI access. Specifically, you will conceptualize and prototype a couple of distinct physical ""AI switches"", each offering different interaction modalities. The process will begin with low-fidelity ideation (e.g., pen-and-paper sketches), followed by the development of functional prototypes using microcontrollers (e.g., ESP32), electronic components (buttons, switches, displays), and digital fabrication techniques (e.g., 3D printing, laser cutting). The prototypes will be evaluated in a comparative, exploratory user study using a Wizard-of-Oz setup, simulating the different AI access levels without needing a fully functional backend.
This thesis explores the design and development of a physical AI buddya tangible, interactive companion that supports childrens learning in museum environments without relying on traditional screen-based interfaces. As digital media increasingly mediates knowledge transfer, especially for young audiences, this project investigates alternative, embodied interaction formats that blend AI-based content delivery with physical presence and intuitive, age-appropriate communication. The broader research scope of this project investigates alternative interaction forms with Large Language Models (LLMs) and simplified input and output forms to provide a more barrier-free interface solution for special contexts.
The aim of the thesis is to conceptualize and prototype an AI-powered physical object that acts as a mediator between children and curated museum content. This AI buddy will be capable of responding to questions, offering simple explanations, and encouraging exploration through playful dialogue or gesture, without the cognitive overload or distraction often associated with screens.
The thesis is intended to be developed in collaboration with a German partner museum, which specializes in science and technology education. These institutions offer rich opportunities to explore how physical AI companions can adapt to different exhibition content and learning environments.
The thesis will result in a functional prototype, a design framework, and recommendations for implementing screenless AI companions in educational institutions such as museums. The work will contribute to the fields of interaction design, child-computer interaction (CCI), and digital museology.
When learning complex motor skills-like playing piano or dancing -we refine our movements over time through repetition and conscious correction.

Students are permitted to make appropriate use of GenAI tools to support their personal study, research and formative work, however, due to differences between disciplines across the University, you should always consult local guidance (e.g., from your department, faculty, college etc.)
More specific guidance around the use of GenAI in assessments is available.
When using GenAI tools and websites, please consider the following in addition to the general guiding principles:
- The use of GenAI tools is not an effective replacement for developing skills or understanding in your subject area.
- GenAI tools can commonly produce incorrect or unsubstantiated information and as such should always be verified from trusted and reliable sources.
- Consider thoughtful use of GenAI and associated software where possible, making appropriate use to support your own development, using the most effective tool for the task at hand, and using efficient prompt-engineering to reduce the amount of iteration necessary.
- Remain aware of the limitations, inconsistencies, and biases that can exist within GenAI tools and data sets, and exercise caution when deciding to use information provided software
- Be accountable and take responsibility for how, when, and why you decide to use generated materials or information from Gen AI software.
If you are unsure about how to effectively use GenAI for your own needs please discuss with your Supervisor or Personal Tutor and, if in doubt, seek clarification of permissible use of AI from your Director of Studies or Director of Teaching.
Guidance for Staff
As GenAI and Large Language Models are likely to continue developing at a rapid pace and become further integrated into our personal and professional lives, all staff are encouraged to explore the possibilities for integrating appropriate AI use into their teaching, learning and assessment.
When doing so, remember to maintain clear and transparent expectations for students, and above all continue to provide a supportive environment for students to discuss, consider, and make the most of these technologies whilst feeling comfortable to approach staff where questions and concerns arise.
We understand that there are sound concerns over the potential implications the use of AI may have on academic integrity, the authenticity of submitted work, and the overall quality of a degree classification with these considered risks. Assessments should be designed, and where necessary redesigned, to mitigate inappropriate use, emphasise key learning outcomes and competencies, and support an integrated approach to these new technologies .
More specific guidance around the use of GenAI in assessments is available.
As staff, we suggest the following guidelines when considering how to respond to wider use of GenAI in teaching and learning in addition to the general guiding principles:
- Reflect on how GenAI tools can support students in broadening their understanding, exploring wider topics, and understanding differing approaches to their subject.
- Review learning outcomes or competencies and provide clarification for students on how GenAI may or may not be used in relation to these.
- Engage with other staff and students to understand how GenAI tools may be used effectively within a controlled teaching and learning context.
- Maintain clear and transparent guidance for students
For further information and support in developing local approaches to the use of GenAI in teaching and learning, please contact the Blended Learning Service.

Studying the LLM in Comparative and European Private Law at the University of Edinburgh was a game changer for me, both professionally and personally.
Drawing on both the civil and common law tradition, this unique programme offers the ideal platform for you to develop expertise in core areas of private law from a comparative perspective, and to benefit from research-led teaching from legal scholars who are recognised as experts in their field.
Through the comparative study of key areas of private law, as well as courses in legal theory and legal history, the programme provides you with the opportunity to obtain an advanced qualification that is both academically rigorous and professionally beneficial.
The programme is particularly suited to those who have studied a range of private law subjects at undergraduate level, although it is also open to those whose undergraduate law degree has combined other specialisations.
This programme offers a wide range of subjects that deal with various aspects of private law from a comparative perspective, as well as courses on legal theory and legal history. In addition, you can select courses from a wide list of options offered by the School, allowing you to tailor the LLM to your specific interests.
You must complete 180 credits of study – 60 credits are taken in the compulsory dissertation and the remaining 120 credits are taken in taught courses. You will choose a minimum of 80 credits from the core courses and up to 40 credits of option courses.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances, or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.
This programme is designed to equip students with recognised Masters-level training in Comparative Private Law.
You will receive advanced legal training enabling you to identify and interpret problems relating to private law using tools of comparative analysis.
As well as providing training in legal research, you will gain an understanding of the main challenges for modern comparative law. The programme will also enable you to progress to the PhD should you so wish.
This programme will provide you with an excellent foundation for both doctoral research in the growing field of comparative private law and legal practice in transnational law firms, or employment in international organisations.

The two-day workshop is preliminary scheduled for the week commencing 10 November 2025, hosted at the London School of Economics and Political Science. This will be advertised on our Upcoming Events pages in due course.
Computational social science (CSS) is typically perceived as an offshoot of traditional quantitative research methods with a greater emphasis on large-scale data and computationally-intensive statistics and models. However, new types of scholarship challenge this perspective, arguing that CSS should be (or already is) closer to qualitative research methodology than most researchers assume (Da ubler & Benoit, 2022; Meng, 2021; Rodriguez & Storer, 2020; Tanweer et al., 2021; Theobold et al., 2024). These debates will likely intensify as CSS leans heavily into new developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) which appear to offer great promise for processing and analysing and collecting new forms of data, and scaling the types of analyses typically found in qualitative work (e.g. Cirone & Spirling, 2021; Chopra & Haaland, 2023; Davidson 2024; Geiecke & Jaravel, 2024; Wheeler, 2025).
This workshop will bring together scholars whose work addresses these emerging issues, moving beyond field-specific questions to develop a new methodological community with a broader shared research agenda.
Research papers dealing with the following themes were particularly encouraged:
- How innovations from CSS and the closely associated recent developments in AI can improve qualitative research methodology, for example via scaling up and automation;
- How qualitative research methodology can help address the limits of CSS, for example through research standards usually identified as qualitative such as ethics, reflexivity and contextualisation;
- The potential for combining CSS and qualitative research methods within mixed-methods research designs;
- The potential for computational qualitative methods as a new type of methodological family, for example computational discourse analysis;
- What building the bridge between CSS and qualitative research does to the question of data: from “BIG Qual” to data quality;
- The difficulties and challenges of collaborating across the CSS / qualitative divide.
Participants whose abstracts are accepted will be expected to draft a full manuscript in advance of the workshop. Each paper will be read ahead of time by workshop participants and will receive close feedback and discussion in dedicated hour-long sessions. Some of the manuscripts presented at the workshop will be invited for submission as a special issue to a strong methodology journal.
This workshop is co-sponsored by the Department of Methodology (LSE) and the Data Science Institute (LSE). A limited number of travel and accommodation bursaries may be available for PhD students, junior scholars, and scholars from the Global South. Please specify whether you would like to be considered for this funding when submitting your abstract.

Develop advanced analytical skills and gain expertise to address complex global legal challenges.
Overview
The LLM in International Law offers students the balance between specialised expertise and a strong grounding in Public International Law (PIL). The specialism covers a very broad range of PIL specialist subject areas in depth, and the Faculty’s teaching is deeply grounded in the general framework of international law. The programme is designed for a wide variety of students, all with a deep interest in human rights and the plethora of issues they generate.
Highlights
- Complete your LLM degree in just 10 months when studying full-time, giving you a head start in industry
- Our location in the heart of legal London provides you with a unique opportunity to draw on the resources of the centre of the UK’s government, legal and financial communities.
- Gain practical skills with pro-bono opportunities offered at the Centre for Access to Justice, allowing you to provide legal advice and give back to the local community.
- Develop your skills and legal knowledge by taking part in mooting and debating competitions.
- Access specialist careers support from our in-house Careers Consultant.
- Be a part of our global student community and take advantage of our unrivalled Graduate Law Society which delivers an outstanding programme of activities and events each term.
- Engage with our PIL extracurricular activities such as the PIL Pro Bono Project, or in international law moots which the Faculty supports.
Why choose this programme?
The specialism is hugely diverse, both in respect of the subjects offered on the programme, which is notable for its breadth and depth; and equally in respect of the profile of our students – who hail from around the world. The specialism is taught by leading experts in their field whose teaching is informed by their research and scholarship, ensuring that our PIL modules engage with current issues and controversies. Students can apply their classroom learning and engage in a wide range of PIL extra-curricular activities students, including the possibility of participating in the PIL Pro Bono Project, or in international law moots which the Faculty supports.
Who should apply?
Students interested in graduate study of PIL tend to have a deep commitment to progressing the rule of law in international relations. This specialism has attracted those who are interested in public and constitutional law, international law, others that have other specialist interests or career ambitions.
Some of our students have recently completed their undergraduate studies, and are looking to develop more specialised knowledge in a subject area they particularly enjoyed and want to work in. Some have a non-PIL background and are looking to change the focus of their career. Others have been working broadly in the field of international law, and want to further develop their expertise in particular sub-fields so as to enhance their future career prospects. Please visit our LLM applying and entry requirements page to find out the exact requirements for this programme.
Programme structure
The programme is delivered through a combination of seminars, lectures and tutorials. Students are expected to actively participate in class discussions, particularly for seminars and tutorials.
Assessment in taught modules is often by examination, an assessed coursework essay, or through a combination of both. There may be other forms of assessments such as oral presentations, output for audience or group projects.
During the programme, you will research and write a 9000 word Research Essay which counts towards your final grade.
- Full-time students
Terms one and two
During the first week of term one, you will attend the LLM Induction Programme, which includes a series of events to welcome you to UCL Laws and to UCL as a whole, and to complete your formal registration onto the LLM programme.
In the second week of term, you will begin your first classes.
There are ten weeks of classes per term, with a break for reading week after week five. Throughout the term, you will be able to take advantage of the wide range of events held within the faculty and across UCL, including special lectures, mooting, debating and activities organised by the UCL Graduate Law Society.
Term three
Your assessments, including any coursework essays are normally submitted in the first week of term three. All examinations take place during term three and can be scheduled at any time during this term. The examination schedule is published at the end of term two.
During the entire year from September to June you will work on your Research Essay (RE) which will be submitted at the end of term three.
- Part-time students
You will follow the same programme as full-time students above, except for the following:
- Your degree will be completed over two academic years
- In your first year, you will take 90 credits of taught modules
- In your second year, you will take the remaining 45 credits of taught modules and the 45 credit Research Essay
- You will therefore complete module selection twice: once at the start of your programme and again in the summer before you return to your second and final year.
You will be invited to attend induction at the start of your first year with the full-time students.
Please note that you will be attending classes with full-time and flexi LLM students. Module teaching can be scheduled between 9am-8pm on weekdays. You will be able to reference the timetable when making your module selections each year.
- Modular/flexible students
You will follow the same programme as full-time students above, except for the following:
- You will have up to 5 academic years to complete your degree.
- You can plan how you would like to complete your 135 taught module credits over that 5 year period based on your personal circumstances (or earlier if you plan to complete the degree in fewer than 5 years).
- We will prompt you to select modules each year. You may wish to have a year or more where you do not take any modules; this is possible.
- It is recommended that you only complete your Research Essay at the end of your degree, in the same year that you are due to complete all of your taught module credits.
- You will be invited to attend induction at the start of your first year with the full-time students.
Please note that you will be attending classes with full-time and part-time LLM students. Module teaching can be scheduled between 9am-8pm on weekdays. You will be able to reference the timetable when making your module selections each year.
Modules
Students will need to obtain a total of 180 credits consisting of taught modules and a research essay to successfully complete the programme. Students choosing a LLM specialist degree are required to select a minimum of 60 credits from the qualifying modules listed below. Students are required to write their Research Essay in the area of the specialism.
Students are advised to plan their modules choices and Research Essay carefully and in advance. You will select your modules at pre-enrolment, before arrival.
Below is an example of the suite of modules you can expect to chose from. The taught modules offered on the LLM programme vary from year to year.

The URZ promotes and researches the use of AI (artificial intelligence) at Heidelberg University.
AI technologies can be used in various areas of the university and are constantly evolving at a rapid pace. Alongside the development, provision and operation of AI services for administration, research, teaching and studies, one of our core tasks includes research into new technologies and systems.
Generative AI tools
The URZ develops and hosts its own AI infrastructure as well as uses open source products to provide employees, students and researchers with secure access to generative AI models and allow them to integrate these tools constructively into their day-to-day work. University members can choose from various large language models via the AI platform.
Generative AI language models (Large Language Models - LLMs) are based on machine learning and can, for example, generate, summarize or translate large amounts of text in real time.
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence in computer science in which systems are trained to recognize patterns using large amounts of data.
Projects
The use of AI systems at the university is being tested and consolidated in various projects and working groups. For example, URZ employees are testing the use of LLMs for specific fields of application, such as supporting the IT Service with a chatbot for first-level support. This type of specialization, which the system is trained for in advance, should also enable other institutions to use AI-supported models in the future.

The main citation styles used at LSE have already developed guidance for how to cite generative AI tools in the body of your assessment and in the bibliography or reference list. We provide examples of how to cite generative AI tools according to a) APA, b) Chicago, c) Harvard, and d) OSCOLA. We also subscribe to Cite Them Right, the accompanying website to the textbook, which includes guidance on citing generative AI in various citation styles.
APA
APA made suggestions for how to cite generative AI in April 2023 - and they have been included in Cite Them Right.
Example in-text citation: When prompted with “Is the left brain right brain divide real or a metaphor?” the ChatGPT-generated text indicated that although the two brain hemispheres are somewhat specialized, “the notation that people can be characterized as ‘left-brained’ or ‘right-brained’ is considered to be an oversimplification and a popular myth” (OpenAI, 2023).
Bibliography: OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. 
Chicago
The Chicago Manual of Style suggested how to cite generative AI in an FAQ from earlier in 2023, which has also been included in Cite Them Right.
Example in-text citation (footnote): 1. Text generated by ChatGPT, OpenAI, March 7, 2023, 
Example in-text citation (author-date): (ChatGPT, March 7, 2023). Bibliography: OpenAI. “ChatGPT.” Accessed August 18 2018. 
Harvard
Cite Them Right suggests that if generative AI material is available online, you can cite it as an electronic version of a source (such as an artwork or article), but otherwise, if the AI’s end product (for example use of ChatGPT in conversation) is only available to you, cite this as a personal communication and include a description of the AI-generated material in your in-text citation.
In-text citation (example A): The AI-generated flower (Shutterstock AI, 2023)
Bibliography (example A): Shutterstock AI (2023) Photo of pond with lotus flower [Digital art]. Available at: (Accessed: 31 March 2023).
In-text citation (example B): When prompted by the author, ChatGPT responded with a ‘definition of academic integrity’ (OpenAI ChatGPT, 2023).
Bibliography (example B): OpenAI ChatGPT (2023) ChatGPT response to John Stephens, 2 April.
OSCOLA
OSCOLA was last revised in 2012 and is due to be revised again in Spring 2024. It is likely that the new guidance will cover citing generative AI. In the short term, you could consider the guidance issued by Robert Gordon University, for example:

This course is open to everyone, and you don’t need any previous knowledge or experience of the subject to attend.
Our short courses are designed especially for adult learners who want to advance their personal or professional development. They are taught by tutors who are expert in both their subjects and in teaching students of all ages and experiences.
Please note that all teaching is in English. You should have near-native command of the English language to get the maximum benefit from the course.
Each week of an online course is roughly equivalent to 2-3 hours of classroom time. On top of this, participants should expect to spend roughly 2-3 hours of self-study time, for example, reading materials, although this will vary from person to person.
While they have a specific start and end date and will follow a weekly schedule (for example, week 1 will cover topic A, week 2 will cover topic B), our tutor-led online courses are designed to be flexible and as such would normally not require participants to be online for a specific day of the week or time of the day (although some tutors may try to schedule times where participants can be online together for web seminars, which will be recorded so that those who are unable to be online at certain times are able to access material).
Unless otherwise stated, all course material will be posted on the VLE so that they can be accessed at any time throughout the duration of the course and interaction with your tutor and fellow participants will take place through a variety of different ways which will allow for both synchronous and asynchronous learning (using discussion boards etc).
Fees
The course fee includes access to the course on our VLE, personal feedback on your work from an expert tutor, a certificate of participation (if you complete work and take part in discussions), and access to the class resources for two years after your course finishes.

Doing so constitutes academic misconduct.” Similarly, there is guidance on how to correctly cite and explain any legitimate use of GenAI which you do make. Note that the general advice on these pages can be added to or amended for specific items of assessment, and so you should always read the instructions given for any assessment carefully.
Detail of the University academic misconduct procedure can be found on the following link, the School Academic Misconduct Officer (SAMO) should be contacted in the first instance inf-samo@
The following guidance applies unless explicitly indicated by the lecturer or course organiser, as discussed under ""Exceptions"" below. Work for credit is anything that contributes towards your formal assessment either for the purposes of progression or degree classification. Note that this covers work which is required but is not issued any marks. The purposes of coursework in the School's teaching include both education and assessment. Assessment tests your personal understanding of material as well as skills gained and usually contributes to your individual grade for a course. Outside institutions and employers place a high value on degrees from this . We owe it to our many hard working students to maintain both the standards and the credibility of our degrees. Academic misconduct is viewed by us and the University as a serious offence. Equally, education is at its best when all sides contribute and feel free to discuss ideas. You are strongly encouraged to join in tutorials and feel free to seek any help; your tutor will know where to draw the line. In any case you should always aim to present work in your own words and be able to explain it both to your tutor as well as yourself. There is an important difference between an acceptable use of other people's ideas and copying or sharing other people's work without attribution (see also the guidelines below). For assessment to be fair, the extent to which submitted work is your own must be clear. Any discussions you have with others must stop well short of an actual solution (essay, code etc.). You must not present work as your own when in fact it is only partially (or even not at all) created by your own efforts.
There are some general principles in preparing any work:
If you produce your own unassisted work then you are in no danger of commiting misconduct. However, if your work requires some help or collaboration then you should follow the guidelines below.
It is acceptable to use general ideas picked up, for example, in discussion with others, or in textbooks, without acknowledgement. In general, if you write the work you submit, in its entirety, yourself then you do not need to include an acknowledgement. An exception is when a really pivotal idea comes from an external source, in which case you should acknowledge that source.
Deliberately allowing your own work to be copied undermines the assessment process. You are required to take reasonable measures to protect your assessed work from unauthorised access. For example, if you put any such work on a public repository then you must set access permissions appropriately (generally permitting access only to yourself, or your group in the case of group practicals). Where there is collusion between students, all students involved may be penalised or disciplined.
Academic misconduct is often easy to detect and the School will use a number of methods to screen coursework, e.g., MOSS for software and Turnitin for essays. When misconduct is detected, it will be reported first to the School Academic Misconduct Officer who will decide if there is a case to answer; if this is so then the matter will be reported to the College Academic Misconduct Officer. His or her committee will then follow due process and determine if an offence has been committed. If the committee finds that an offence was committed then an appropriate penalty will be applied and the student's academic record amended to show that an offence was committed.
It is a natural and beneficial part of the educational experience for students to discuss their work with each other and to incorporate ideas from many sources into their work. For example, the tutorial exercises in various courses are not assessed and you are free, indeed encouraged, to seek out and use all sources of help in learning the material. This includes working together with fellow students on the exercises if you want. Of course, there is no benefit in just copying somebody else's tutorial exercise solutions without understanding; there is a lack of genuine learning, leading eventually to failure on the exam. However, work that is not for credit is not covered by the regulations on academic misconduct.
The following guidance applies unless explicitly indicated by the lecturer or course organiser, as discussed under ""Exceptions"" below. This section pulls together various points made above as well as presenting some further advice. Some students stray into possible academic misconduct without realising it. The following advice is based on actual situations, please note that it does not replace the full University requirements.
Some practicals are specifically designed to encourage collaboration (for example, teamwork or other forms). In such cases the lecturer or course organiser will clarify what is expected regarding shared or common material.
It is now quite common to make work (mostly code) available on public repositories. This section is concerned with the rules for student solutions to coursework (of any kind) for credit. The rules are as follows:

This course is open to everyone, and you don’t need any previous knowledge or experience of the subject to attend.
Our short courses are designed especially for adult learners who want to advance their personal or professional development. They are taught by tutors who are expert in both their subjects and in teaching students of all ages and experiences.
Please note that all teaching is in English. You should have near-native command of the English language to get the maximum benefit from the course.
Each week of an online course is roughly equivalent to 2-3 hours of classroom time. On top of this, participants should expect to spend roughly 2-3 hours of self-study time, for example, reading materials, although this will vary from person to person.
While they have a specific start and end date and will follow a weekly schedule (for example, week 1 will cover topic A, week 2 will cover topic B), our tutor-led online courses are designed to be flexible and as such would normally not require participants to be online for a specific day of the week or time of the day (although some tutors may try to schedule times where participants can be online together for web seminars, which will be recorded so that those who are unable to be online at certain times are able to access material).
Unless otherwise stated, all course material will be posted on the VLE so that they can be accessed at any time throughout the duration of the course and interaction with your tutor and fellow participants will take place through a variety of different ways which will allow for both synchronous and asynchronous learning (using discussion boards etc).
Fees
The course fee includes access to the course on our VLE, personal feedback on your work from an expert tutor, a certificate of participation (if you complete work and take part in discussions), and access to the class resources for two years after your course finishes.
Concessions

Course Description
In recent years, foundation models, i.e., models that are trained on broad datasets and can be used for different applications, have transformed computer vision and natural language processing. In this practical course, we will first get an overview of different foundation models via student presentations and then explore the applications of such models.
We envision the practical part of this course similar to a hackathon, where the goal is to build an interesting application using the given foundation model. Example projects from this course are as follows.
Diffusion Models: Adapt large pre-trained diffusion models like stable diffusion to a special use case using ControlNets.
Depth Prediction: Build a simple VR application using general-purpose depth prediction networks and a camera tracker.
etc.
Course Layout
Students will work in teams of 3 on a given topic, which will be assigned through a preference-based matching at the start of the semester.
There will be three block sessions in which attendance is mandatory.
Kick-Off Session (Date: TBD): Instructors will present the different topics and explain the course organization.
First Presentation Session (Date: TBD): Student teams will present the theoretical ideas behind the foundation model they are working on. For this, students will have to review recent publications.
Second Presentation Session (Date: TBD): Student teams will present their practical work at the end of the semester.
Besides these mandatory meetings, teams will arrange individual supervision sessions with their respective supervisor on a regular basis (Rough guideline: 30mins meeting every two weeks). Besides that, supervisors will be available via chat.
Grading
The final grade will be determined through a weighted average of the both presentations, the project and the final report.

Avoid Zoombombing
As some classes, meetings and events are held online during hybrid work and study, it is important to take extra precautions to safeguard your own safety as well as the safety of others. Especially when using online meeting tools such as Zoom, which enable our community to connect with people outside the University, consider the following safety tips and recommendations.
When using Zoom, ensure that you take the following precautions:
- Always require a password for meetings. This password should never be shared publicly and should be sent separately from the meeting invitation.
- Do not share meeting links on social media or other public platforms where they can easily be intercepted by trolls or cybercriminals.
- Use the Waiting Room feature and verify all attendees one-by-one before granting access.
- Change your screen sharing settings to ‘Host only.’ This will prevent trolls from accessing your video calls. You can either change this in your pre-meeting settings or in the in-call admin settings for Share Screen -> Advanced Sharing Settings.
- Disable “Join Before Host” to prevent people causing trouble before you arrive.
- Enable “Co-Host” so you can assign a co-facilitator to help you moderate.
- Disable “File Transfer” to prevent digital virus sharing.
- Disable “Allow Removed Participants to Rejoin” so that expelled attendees cannot regain access.
- Do not use personal email addresses when registering for, or using, Zoom. Use your University email instead.
- No confidential, sensitive or personally-identifiable University information should be discussed or displayed.

Follow Etiquette and Uphold Dignity and Respect Online
Follow Video Conference Etiquette
It is important to employ good practice when it comes to both facilitating and participating in video conferences and online classrooms. Currently, the University supports the use of Microsoft Teams, Blackboard Collaborate, and Zoom for video conferencing and meetings. Tips for communicating successfully through video conferencing include:
- Set an agenda for your session and stick to this to ensure everyone remains on the same page.
- Choose a quiet location for attending any video conferences or meetings.
- Arrive early to allow plenty of time to check mics and connections.
- Advise participants to mute their microphone when not speaking.
- Set clear expectations for engagement at the start of a session. For example, ask participants to use the ""raise your hand"" function in Collaborate before speaking.
- Consider using a pre-recorded presentation if your session needs to reach a lot of people.
- Ensure your session caters for accessibility needs, for example by including subtitles and offering the content in an alternative format.

The guidance included within these pages supports the Assessment and Feedback Principles at LSE, a set of actionable principles which were reviewed and refreshed in 2024/25 to support LSE’s wider Assessment and Feedback Enhancement Programme.
Assessment and Feedback Principles at LSE
These principles reflect LSE’s unique educational context and distinctive mix of single and joint social science degree programmes, as well as strategic institutional priorities and broader sectoral, local and global contexts. They recognise the importance of designing assessment across a programme as well as the unique challenges where LSE students have significant freedom to create their own degree pathways.
Emphasis is placed on achieving consistency in assessment design across the institution while recognising the high value placed on student agency in selecting the courses they are most interested in, and on departmental autonomy in the design of curriculum. Developing curriculum coherence and understanding the impact of assessment and feedback across multiple courses are at the core of enhancing assessment.
The principles are actionable and invite engagement by balancing the imperatives of maintaining rigour and high academic standards, the primacy of disciplinary perspectives and academic programme ownership and the School’s response to the dynamic development of generative AI tools.
Embedding these principles will help in defining a more inclusive, supportive, and forward-thinking assessment environment to enable our students to excel on their programmes and achieve outstanding academic outcomes.
This set of 10 active principles are designed to enable Departments, programme directors and course convenors to advance assessment improvements.
Please contact your Eden Centre Departmental Advisers if you would like help implementing any of the approaches shown in this Toolkit.
Academics beyond LSE are welcome to use the Toolkit, which draws on good practice from research literature and across the sector.

Ten ideas on the use of AI to support students in their learning, together with suggested responses for teaching
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can have many creative uses beyond simply generating text in response to prompts in a chat interface. However, many of these come with limitations that are not always immediately obvious. This advice assumes you may already have some experience in using generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Bard or Bing. If not, please refer to our Beyond ChatGPT: The state of generative AI in academic practice report for an exploration of their capabilities.
The activities below may be used in Oxford’s different teaching settings (tutorials, classes, seminars, lectures etc) either before, during or after class, to develop understanding of the opportunities and pitfalls of using generative AI tools in academic practice.
Generative AI tools and plagiarism
Students should be aware that AI tools cannot replace human critical thinking or the development of scholarly evidence-based arguments and subject knowledge that forms the basis of their university education.
Students using AI during their studies must learn and practise the same academic skills of note-taking and clear attribution which are safeguards against plagiarism, ensuring clear differentiation of their own work from any text or material derived from generative AI tools. Unauthorised use of AI falls under the plagiarism regulations and would be subject to academic penalties in summative assessments.
Where the use of generative AI in preparing work for examination has been authorised by the department, faculty or programme, students should give clear acknowledgment of how it has been used in their work.
Ten ideas on the use of generative AI to support students in their learning, together with suggested responses for teaching
1. Where in their learning can students develop an appreciation of the reliability and limitations of generative AI outputs?
Giving students multiple opportunities to critique generative AI outputs in relation to disinformation, fabrication and biased information, can help them assess its roles to assist their learning. Discussion can focus on the care that is needed in using these tools and reinforce the expectations of good academic practice in their studies.
- Consider asking students to generate different prompts to scope the same topic (and/or use a different AI tool) to see how the change in prompt and/or tool impacts the output generated. This iterative approach to designing prompt questions provides opportunities for students to appraise the outputs generated and discuss the limitations of generative AI as the sole tool within their studies.
- Encourage students to review generative AI outputs in terms of information bias, for example, what perspectives are being shared and what are not.
- Ask students to check the outputs for fabrications and false information, for example, can they locate any references cited and/or can they find other sources that validate the outputs, for example, from published papers and texts or assigned reading lists.
2. Where in their learning may students use generative AI to find out about (or get started on) a topic?
Providing opportunities for students to use the appropriate AI tool to quickly scope a topic and then use this information to develop further their own ideas can help them get started in exploring material. Students may benefit from engaging with a wider range of source materials using the ability of some AI tools to translate between a limited range of languages. This allows students to access resources in their first and/or target language.
- Encourage students to use generative AI to scope a topic and bring short summaries of the key points for further discussion and review in class, for example, this could be prompts based on their reading list or other course materials.
- Ask students to use generative AI to identify and translate subject-specific vocabulary into more understandable terms and create a glossary. This can support students in building their understanding when reading academic papers.
- Discuss with students where AI can fail, for example, what aspects of the topic have been omitted, incorrectly reported or referenced, or how contributors from all nationalities, genders, ethnicities or backgrounds may not have been represented.
3. Are there ways in which students may use generative AI to support consolidation of their lecture/practical class/seminar notes?
Students value having the opportunity to organise and structure their study notes effectively into a variety of formats (eg visual, bullet-points, lists, tables, mind-maps). Students can use these outputs to identify gaps in their knowledge and help build their understanding of connections between different topics.
- Consider asking students to use AI tools to consolidate their lecture notes into different formats, for example, in a bullet point list, structure outline, table of key concepts or mind map.
- Drawing on the AI generated outputs, use teaching opportunities to discuss with students what areas might require further clarification and encourage them to synthesise their ideas/knowledge across different topics.
4. Where in their learning could students use generative AI to assess their understanding of a topic?
Students value multiple opportunities to gain immediate feedback on their understanding of a given topic. AI tools can generate open-ended questions and even evaluate a student’s responses. In this way, students can use this approach to identify gaps in their knowledge and focus their study time more effectively.
- Encourage students to use AI to generate practice questions about the subject they study with sample responses to enable them to independently self-assess their understanding of a topic.
- Discuss with students the content of the AI generated output and ask them to review how it changes, depending on the tools and prompts that are used as well as each time they ask the same question.
5. Are there ways in which generative AI can support students to develop their data analysis and research skills?
Giving students opportunities to use generative AI to analyse existing data or explore the properties of data sets, may support them in developing their research and data analysis skills and in getting started with their research. Having discussions with students about the generative AI outputs can augment their own research and data analysis skills.
- Ask students to use generative AI to analyse an existing data set to identify trends and relationships and bring the output to class to discuss and review. Students could be asked to compare their outputs and discuss how they can evaluate the validity of the AI generated analysis as part of developing their own data analysis skills.
- Ask students to use generative AI to build surveys or questionnaires to augment their research skills learning and discuss the outputs in class. For example, explore whether AI can help in generating survey questions based on predefined objectives, suggest ordering of questions and provide ideas on how to improve surveys to maximise user engagement.
6. Are there ways in which generative AI may help develop students’ reading and critical analysis skills?
Providing opportunities for students to review and discuss generative AI generated outputs may support the development of their reading and critical thinking skills.
- Ask students to summarise key texts and then ask AI to generate a summary using language that is easy for them to understand, structured in different ways. Encourage students to discuss how the summaries differ, even when students have given similar prompts to the same tool. You might use teaching time to discuss different ways in which writing alternative presentations can support deeper understanding.
- Ask students to use a generative AI tool to generate some critical questions about a text and compare this output with their own notes and understanding in discussion in class.
7. Where in their learning may students use generative AI to support the development of their academic writing?
Students value opportunities to develop skills and understanding of the basic structure and format of different types of academic writing. Generative AI can support students to improve their academic writing as part of their academic skills development.
- Ask students to use generative AI to generate examples of different types of academic writing or presentations based on the same topic and bring the outputs generated to class to discuss. Students can see how a topic would be presented in an essay format versus an abstract or a poster presentation or a different writing style (students can see how to write for a general audience or a more specialised one).
- Ask students to use generative AI to generate templates or outlines for various essay types, including argumentative, descriptive, expository and narrative. Students might use these as a starting point for their own writing alongside a discussion about good academic practice and appropriate use of AI-generated content in your subject to avoid plagiarism.
8. What are the ways in which students could use generative AI to gain feedback on their writing?
Students value having instant, personalised feedback on their learning, allowing them to understand where they are excelling and where they need to make improvements in their work. Generative AI can give supportive, constructive feedback to help students refine and improve their writing. However, this feedback is not always correct, and students need to be encouraged to use their critical skills to evaluate its appropriateness.
- Encourage students to ask for feedback on examples of their writing from different generative AI tools. Students can ask for suggestions on the structure, coherence and clarity of their writing and use this advice when approaching future writing tasks.
- Remind students that they are encouraged to proof-read their own work, as this is an essential skill in academic writing, and should not use generative AI tools to make material changes to work in draft.
- Ask students in a tutorial or class to develop quizzes using generative AI and complete them. AI can provide immediate feedback, allowing students to understand and correct their mistakes promptly and enrich discussions on common areas of misunderstanding. Students should be encouraged to further validate their answers against another non-AI source as generative AI tools can give erroneous information.
9. Are there ways in which generative AI may enhance students’ learning in class?
Students value opportunities to hear a range of perspectives and AI generated outputs can elicit different viewpoints to those held by the students. It can generate alternative explanations of different contexts, give more examples and suggest analogies. This can serve to enrich and support students in developing their wider contextual understanding of a topic. Generative AI may also support students in understanding instructional texts (including how to guides) by offering opportunities to explore them in multiple formats.
- Consider asking students to seek outputs from generative AI based on a range of discussion topics/questions that you provide (eg same prompt, different generative AI tools, different prompts, same generative AI tool). Use teaching time to facilitate discussions between students in which they question one another on their respective outputs to ascertain and understand the range of perspectives that can be generated through different AI prompts and/or tools.
- Encourage students to use generative AI to research a practical methodology in advance of a laboratory class. This will support them to have a better understanding of why those techniques are used and reflect on the guidance in relation to the formal laboratory teaching protocols and guidance to ensure safe and appropriate practice. This can help build students’ confidence in undertaking experiments and learning about different approaches to experimental design. Importantly, this can enhance students’ engagement with practical work by moving them away from passively following protocols without necessarily understanding the underlying experimental rationale.
10. Can students see examples of how generative AI has been used to support specific skills in language and coding?
Generative AI can support students learning across a range of subjects and develop outputs that range from text-based to non-text-based problems.
- Ask students to engage in written conversations with generative AI in their target language, allowing them to practise real-time interactions. This can be done in class with the students. Alternatively, ask students to do this before class and bring key learning points for discussion to the class, where you can encourage students to identify any errors in the AI generated outputs.
- Consider asking students to create multiple versions of example texts in many languages and ask students to translate them and compare translations or their own writing. Students can take advantage of generative AI’s deep multilingual capabilities to support their language development in multiple ways and multiple levels.
- Ask students to use generative AI to help them describe existing code or identify computer code errors. It can analyse a student's code and provide suggestions for fixing issues. This step-by-step approach promotes a clearer understanding, iterative development, and the value of learning from coding errors. Students can bring the feedback received to class for discussion.

Q. How do I know if I am eligible for the Cambridge programme?
See our Eligibility page.
Q. How do I apply?
See the 'Apply overview' and 'Guide to applying' pages. (Applications now closed).
Q. When is the deadline for applications?
The application submission deadline for all European programmes is 1 February 2025.
Applications for the Cambridge Programme will close 23:59 GMT 1 February 2025.
Q. Can I apply to multiple European Amgen Scholars Programmes?
You can apply to as many of the programmes as you wish, but be aware that each programme has its own application process.
Q. Does the proposed Project Supervisor need to do anything as a part of my application?
Yes. When you submit your application, your Project Supervisor will be emailed with a link to a form to complete - this will ask them to provide a brief outline of the project.
There will be a deadline included for them to submit the form (5th February 2025). We strongly advise you to tell your Project Supervisor to expect this email. We also advise they submit this as soon as possible to prevent last minute issues.
Q. How many references / letters of recommendation do I need?
You will need to name one referee in your application form, and include their email address . When you submit your application, they will then be automatically emailed with a form to submit, and a deadline for submission. We strongly advise you to tell your referee to expect this email. We also advise they submit this as soon as possible to prevent last minute issues.
Do not send additional references, name additional referees or send separate letters - these will not be checked and may result in your application being rejected.
The deadline for referees to submit their reference forms is 5th February 2025.
Q. Who should I ask to be my referee?
Your referee should be someone who knows you in an academic capacity, ideally a university lecturer or tutor, who can speak about your academic performance. It makes most sense to choose someone who has taught you and knows you well, as they will be able to complete the reference form more completely.
Q. What will my referee be asked to comment on?
Your referee will be asked to submit an online form (see 'Guide to applying')
In the form, they will be asked to provide a comment or ranking on several areas relating to the applicant's academic performance and ability. They will also be asked to comment on the applicant's English language skills.
Q. When will I find out if I am accepted onto the programme?
At the Cambridge ASP, we aim to inform all applicants regarding the outcome of their application by early March 2025. Notification dates for the other European programmes can be found on the individual programme websites.
Q. Are there certain application requirements common to all programme sites in Europe?
Yes. Each European ASP will - at a minimum - require the submission of an academic transcript, a letter of recommendation (or reference form) and a personal statement. You should check each site's individual requirements.
Q. What is an academic transcript?
An academic transcript is an official document from your university that summarises a student's academic progress and performance to date. It should include the university and course title, alongside grades for each module taken.
If your transcript is not in English, please provide a translation alongside the official copy.
Q. If I am not selected this year, can I apply again?
Yes. As long as you continue to meet the eligibility criteria, you can apply again.
Q. Do I need to be a citizen of a European country to apply?
No, but you need to be an undergraduate student at a European* university. See the 'Eligibility' page for more information on who is eligible.
*Eligible students must attend a college or university in a country that is participating in the Bologna Process.
Q. Can students who are only spending a short period of time (i.e. a semester or year abroad) at a European university apply?
No. To be eligible, applicants must be currently enrolled at a college or university in Europe AND intend to earn their undergraduate degree at a college or university in Europe.
Q. Do I need to provide formal evidence of my English language ability?
Formal evidence is not required, but scholars will need a good working knowledge of English in order to participate fully.
Q. Do I need to have research experience to apply?
No. We encourage applications from students with research experience as well as newcomers to the field. Applications are particularly encouraged from students who attend colleges and universities that have limited opportunities for students to conduct research.
Q. If applicable, am I required to obtain the appropriate visas to participate in the Amgen Scholars Programme?
Yes. It is the participant's responsibility to acquire the necessary visas to attend their respective summer programme and the symposium (in Cambridge, England). The European host institutions will help scholars with this process.
Q. What should I say in my initial email to a potential Project Supervisor?
It best practice for students to consider their research areas of interest and make a short list of faculty to contact in these fields (you should use the research themes database to identify suitable Project Supervisors). You can then compose a carefully considered email, stating the research areas you are interested in or an idea of a research project that you have. You can include a CV or other relevant information in this first email.
A generic email sent to a large number of faculty is not likely to yield a positive response.
Q. I am having difficulty finding a supervisor, what should I do?
The Cambridge ASP is very competitive and that means academics are often contacted by far more people than they are able to offer research projects to.
If you have not heard back from an academic then it is likely that they are not able to offer you a project and you should move onto contacting alternative potential Project Supervisors.
You may also wish to consider the content of the email you are sending, and if this could be improved.
Q. What is the deadline for Referees and proposed Project Supervisors to submit their forms?
The deadline for both referees and potential supervisors to submit their forms is 5th February 2025. They will have been emailed with the form when you submitted your application.
Q. What should I consider about the use of AI in my application?

Entry requirements
Entrants to the UCL LLM must have ‘a good 2.1 with evidence of 1st class ability’ (or equivalent in other jurisdictions), and must provide evidence in their application of motivation, reasoning and analytical ability and communication skills.
'A good 2.1’ shall normally mean an average of at least 65% (or equivalent in other jurisdictions) across all years of study, and ‘evidence of 1st class ability’ shall normally mean at least one 1st class mark (or equivalent in other jurisdictions) over the entire degree.
We may be willing to consider applicants who are close to, but do not meet these quantitative criteria, where space on the programme allows. Such applicants must demonstrate that they excel in motivation, analytical and reasoning ability and communication skills. This needs to be demonstrated across the personal statement and the written work. Applicants with less than an average of 62% (or equivalent in other jurisdictions) across all years of study, will not normally be considered under these criteria.
You need a law qualification to be considered for the LLM, i.e. Bachelor of Laws (LLB), Juris Doctor (JD), Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL). In exceptional circumstances, graduates without a law qualification but with work experience will be considered, however, experience must be relevant and a minimum of five years. This is a very uncommon route onto the programme.
Graduates whose first degree is not in law will be considered for admission if they have an average of 65% across all years of undergraduate study, plus an average of at least 65% plus at least one mark over 70% in the Graduate Diploma in Law recognised by UK professional bodies (achieved or in progress). Alternatively, graduates whose first degree is not in law will be considered if they have an average of 65% across all years of undergraduate study, plus have successfully completed studies on a Solicitors Qualifying Examination full time programme of at least 12 months duration, usually resulting in a Masters qualification equivalent to a Merit classification, with an average of 65% in all assessments including a pass in the SQE on first attempt.

Teaching and learning
Our faculty home, Bentham House, was reopened in March 2018 following a major three-year redevelopment. The Grade II listed building has been significantly expanded and modernised, featuring new teaching and event spaces. At the heart of the building is a bright, five-story glass atrium that serves as a café and social hub for the entire UCL Laws community.
Modules in the LLM Law programme are taught through a mix of seminars, lectures, and tutorials. You will be expected to prepare in advance and actively participate in class discussions, especially during seminars and tutorials. You may also work in teams and deliver presentations to your class.
Each module is supported by a dedicated Moodle page containing materials such as reading lists, links to relevant websites and academic articles.
Assessment in taught modules is usually by examination, but may also include a coursework essay, or other methods of assessment, such as an oral presentations. Most assessments take place in term 3.
During the programme, you will research and write a 45-credit Research Essay which counts towards your final grade. You will be expected to select a research topic within your area of legal interest, or that relates to your specialism (if applicable). You will receive guidance and support through lectures and academic supervisors. The Research Essay is due at the end of term 3.
For full-time students, typical contact hours are approximately 2 hours per week for each taught module you are taking in any one term. Outside of lectures, seminars, workshops and tutorials full-time students typically study the equivalent of a full-time job, using their remaining time for self-directed study and completing coursework assignments.
Most module assessments are completed during the April/May exam period, even for those taught in the first term. The 10-month LLM is a demanding and intensive course, so you will need to be prepared to fully commit to your studies from day one until the end of the programme.
Modules
-
Full-time students will study 180 credits (135 taught module credits and a 45 credit Research Essay) to complete the LLM, over a period of 10 months.
If you apply to a specialism, you will need to select a minimum of 60 credits from the taught modules which are part of that specialism degree. The remaining credits needed can be obtained from any other available taught modules.
Students will be invited to choose modules before the programme begins. Module places may be limited and will be subject to availability where there is a high demand.Your programme of studies
During the first week of term 1, you will attend the LLM Induction Programme, which includes a series of events to welcome you to UCL Laws and to UCL as a whole, and to complete your formal registration onto the LLM programme.
In the second week of term, you will begin your first taught module classes.
There are ten weeks of classes in term 1 and 2, with a break for reading week after week five.
You will be invited to choose your Research Essay topic at the beginning of the programme and then be supported in your research and writing until it is time for submission at the end of the programme.
Your assessments, including examinations and coursework essays, are normally taken in term 3 and can be scheduled at any time during this term. The assessment schedule is usually published at the end of term 2.
During the entire year from September to June you will work on your Research Essay which will be submitted at the end of term 3.

These PhD with integrated study programmes promote interdisciplinary study and collaboration with other universities and industrial partners, combining PhD study with taught courses, industrial placements and other training opportunities.
The UKRI AI Centre for Doctoral Training in Biomedical Innovation will teach students to use AI to improve the diagnosis, understanding, management, and treatment of disease. Students will be trained to practise responsible and trustworthy use of AI in research, which is fundamental to maintaining the public’s trust in the use of health data.
A wealth of expertise from across the University, national bodies, external partners and expert advisory and patient involvement and engagement groups will support the programme.
Students in the CDT in Biomedical Innovation will work with external partners in the private and public sectors to ensure their research addresses critical challenges in healthcare maximising the potential for AI to have a positive impact on society.
The CDT will build upon the expertise and connections of the existing CDT in Biomedical AI.
The UKRI AI Centre of Doctoral Training in Designing Responsible NLP is dedicated to addressing the increasing necessity for an ethically grounded approach in AI technologies. As NLP becomes more integral to applications like personal assistants (Siri, Alexa), chatbots (such as ChatGPT), and other generative AI, the stakes are higher than ever. Ensuring these systems are responsibly integrated into our daily lives requires a deep understanding of their operational mechanisms and societal impacts.
Doctoral students of the centre will engage in an interdisciplinary educational experience that spans the technical, social, design, and legal domains of AI. The curriculum is designed to foster understanding across these diverse fields, emphasizing collaboration and the development of hybrid expertise. This is your opportunity to contribute to building AI systems that are not only advanced but are also equitable, sustainable, and sensitive to the complex social fabrics they operate within.
Embrace the challenge of steering the future of AI by ensuring it is both responsible and trustworthy. Join us at the forefront of shaping AI to serve global needs responsibly.
Machine Learning has a dramatic impact on our daily lives built on the back of improved computer systems. Systems research and ML research are symbiotic. Modern systems research targets the ubiquitous need for efficient ML. ML research, conversely, is directly affected by how methods will be deployed. Furthermore, systems research increasingly explores ML methods to improve systems, and ML research develops such methods.
This CDT will develop researchers with expertise across the systems-ML stack. Company engagement is an integral part of the programme with built-in internships alongside entrepreneurship training. The PhD programme in Machine Learning Systems will position students for strong, ethically aware technical careers, developing the next generation of leaders.
Students must have a broad understanding of different hardware designs, different platforms, different environments, different models, and different goals beyond their immediate research focus. Individual supervisory teams rarely have this breadth of knowledge. This makes a cohort-based CDT vital, treating ML Systems as a holistic discipline. Cohort interaction, and integration gives students real experience across multiple systems, approaches and methodologies.
Quantum technology will revolutionise many aspects of life and bring enormous benefits to the economy and society. The new Centre for Doctoral Training in Quantum Informatics will provide advanced training in the structure, behaviour, and interaction of quantum hardware, software, and applications. The training programme spans computer sciences, mathematics, physics, and engineering, and will enable the use of quantum technology in a way that is integrable, interoperable, and impactful, rather than developing the hardware itself.
The training programme targets three research challenges with a strong focus on end user impact: (i) quantum service architecture concerns how to design quantum networks and devices most usefully; (ii) scalable quantum software is about feasible application at scale of quantum technology and its integration with other software; and (iii) quantum application analysis investigates how quantum technology can be used most advantageously to solve end user problems.
The programme offers a fully funded intensive 4-year PhD with integrated study programme that equips students with the skills needed to tackle the research challenges of quantum informatics. The programme includes bespoke training by the National Quantum Computing Centre, and the opportunity to work with over 30 industry partners. Graduates will be able to integrate quantum hardware with high-performance computing, design effective quantum software, and apply this in a societally meaningful way.
UKRI AI Centre for Doctoral Training in Dependable and Deployable Artificial Intelligence for Robotics will be led by Heriot-Watt University in partnership with the University of Edinburgh.
To make a difference in our homes and workplaces, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence technologies - such as AI assistants for independent living, manufacturing and construction robots or robots working in extreme conditions - need to be safe, dependable, and trustworthy. While AI methods are finding increasing adoption within robotics, these technologies were not originally designed with safety and other human-centred requirements in mind. Making AI suitable for such dependable and deployable products will require a new way of thinking.
CDT-D2AIR will train experts who can think in new ways around researching, designing, building, and deploying dependable and safe robotics and AI solutions.
The School currently hosts students in 3 CDTs that have admitted their final cohorts and are no longer accepting applications.
The CDT offers an interdisciplinary training programme covering technical AI skills, biomedical foundations and individually tailored training on understanding the societal aspects of Biomedical AI.
Students benefit from cutting-edge computing and experimental facilities, including a large GPU cluster and eye-tracking, speech, virtual reality, and visualisation labs.
The Centre addresses key challenges for managing interactions between robots and their environments, between multiple autonomous systems, and between robots and people.

As AI tools and capabilities develop, this guidance, and our approach to refining it, may adapt. Suggestions and feedback are very welcome to the Head of Digital Campaigns and Communications.
AI tools are changing the way we work at Oxford, whether that’s improving the quality of our written communications or helping speed up our research tasks. But it is important that we work together to ensure that their use aligns with our values and our obligations.
Oxford is committed to setting a clear, confident standard for the responsible use of AI in communications. These guidelines outline expectations for the use of generative AI tools by communicators at Oxford. Technology and approaches change rapidly; we will aim to test and review these on a regular basis and update as necessary. Our aim is not to be restrictive, but rather to ensure those using these tools feel confident in the boundaries of what is acceptable in our community. These guidelines were developed with input from Divisional Communications Leads, the AI Competency Centre and Information Security.
The guidelines can be read alongside the Russell Group principles on the use of generative AI tools in education, which support the development and use of AI in a way that enables their ethical use and upholds academic rigour and integrity.
Scope: context
This guidance has been developed by the Public Affairs Directorate to support responsible, ethical and effective use of generative AI in University communications. It applies to all colleagues working in communications roles across Oxford – whether in departments, divisions, colleges or central services.
Endorsed by the University’s Information and Digital Committee, the guidance outlines current best practice for using GenAI tools in content creation, editorial planning and audience engagement. It is intended to safeguard accuracy, uphold academic and reputational standards, and ensure alignment with the University’s digital and data ethics principles.
We strongly encourage all communications professionals to adopt this guidance in their work.
Scope: technology
This guidance relates to the use of generative AI (GenAI) tools – artificial intelligence systems that simulate creativity by predicting and assembling outputs based on learned patterns from the data they have been trained on, not human comprehension. Their results are intended to appear plausible but can contain inaccurate information or off topic hallucinations, requiring careful human oversight. This includes tools built on large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini or Copilot, as well as those that generate images, audio or video, like Midjourney, Notebook LM or Sora.
GenAI is increasingly embedded within the platforms and systems we already use, enhancing functionality and speeding up tasks when used effectively. For this reason, it is important to remember that GenAI and LLMs do not comprehend information in any way akin to humans. Their neural networks can generate outputs that are factually inaccurate and misleading.
This guidance applies to both standalone GenAI tools and AI-powered features within other software or platforms.
It does not cover all forms of artificial intelligence used across the University – only tools that generate content. However, some of the broad principles outlined here may be useful in other contexts too.
Understanding what AI is – and what it isn’t – is critical for its effective use. Here are a few helpful guides:
Summary
Our guidelines can be summarised by the following principles:
- We prioritise human creativity, curiosity and judgement.
- Oxford's reputation stands on the trustworthiness of our research and our communications. We are transparent with each other and with our audiences about our use of AI and ensure that AI is not used to conceal or alter original intent or meaning.
- As communications professionals, we are responsible for the quality and accuracy of the content we produce. The use of any AI tool should therefore be seen as a supportive mechanism to create value and enable productivity, with the recognition that outputs from generative AI are susceptible to bias, mistakes and misinformation. All AI-assisted outputs must undergo a human review for factual accuracy, appropriate tone and ethical integrity before public release.
- We work to ensure we have the skills to use the right GenAI tools in the right way, working to understand the context of the tools we’re using and the benefits and risks they offer. This includes using tools appropriately, in line with University guidance, and taking appropriate data and security precautions.",1,98.7,University of Oxford,10.9,100.0,21750,1,ox.ac.uk,96.6,2400:00,98.5,97.5,United Kingdom,"policy, technical documentation, research materials",4.415043139606215,0.5055555555555555,727,False,1

TOEFL or TOEFL Special Home Edition: Overall score of 109 with 27/30 in reading and writing and 23/30 in speaking and listening. Please note that TOEFL iBT MyBestScore is not acceptable for meeting the English language requirement. UCL's institution code for TOEFL is 9163.
- Academic entry requirements
Entrants to the UCL LLM programme must have ‘a good 2.1 with evidence of 1st class ability’ (or equivalent in other jurisdictions), and must provide evidence in their application of motivation, reasoning and analytical ability and communication skills. Please refer to the UCL Graduate Prospectus for international equivalent qualifications.
‘A good 2.1’ shall normally mean an average of at least 65% (or equivalent in other jurisdictions) across all years of study, and ‘evidence of 1st class ability’ shall normally mean at least one 1st class mark (or equivalent in other jurisdictions) over the entire degree.
We may be willing to consider applicants who are close to, but do not meet these quantitative criteria, where space on the programme allows. Such applicants must demonstrate that they excel in motivation, analytical and reasoning ability and communication skills. This needs to be demonstrated across the personal statement and the written work. Applicants with less than an average of 62% (or equivalent in other jurisdictions) across all years of study will not normally be considered under these criteria.
You need a law qualification to be considered for the LLM, i.e. Bachelor of Laws (LLB), Juris Doctor (JD), Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL). In very exceptional circumstances, graduates without a law qualification but with work experience will be considered, although this is a very uncommon route to the programme. In these instances, experience must be relevant and a minimum of five years.
Graduates whose first degree is not in law will be considered for admission if they have an average of 65% across all years of undergraduate study, plus an average of at least 65% plus at least one mark over 70% in the Graduate Diploma in Law recognised by UK professional bodies (achieved or in progress). Alternatively, graduates whose first degree is not in law will be considered if they have an average of 65% across all years of undergraduate study, plus have successful completed studies on a Solicitors Qualifying Examination full time programme of at least 12 months duration, usually resulting in a Masters qualification equivalent to a Merit classification with an average of 65% in all assessments, including a pass in the SQE on first attempt.

The LLM in International Law is designed for those wishing to specialise in public international law and provides you with the opportunity to study the fundamentals of international law and international relations at an advanced level.
The programme encourages and supports the development of independent thinking and research skills to prepare students for a career in international law or international organisations. Courses will cover the theoretical basis for the development of international law, as well as exploring real-life examples and case studies on how rules and principles are applied in practice.
The vast majority of students will have a first degree in law or international relations. Previous knowledge of international law is not a prerequisite, but those unfamiliar with the subject are advised to take Fundamental Issues in International Law as one of their options.
I had the opportunity to develop a broad and solid knowledge of International Law, while being supported throughout this journey by extraordinary academics.
International law is an important discipline that provides the framework for cooperation in many fields of international relations, including:
- Peace and security
- Trade and investment
- Environmental protection
- Telecommunications
- Air travel
- Maritime navigation
A qualification in international law opens up opportunities for jobs in a wide range of sectors, including working for government foreign ministries, international organisations, and non-governmental organisations or consultancies involved in international affairs.
The University of Edinburgh has been one of the leading centres for teaching and research in Public International Law since 1707.
Today, Edinburgh Law School has a dynamic team of research-active international legal experts who are at the cutting-edge of their discipline, providing fresh insights and informed commentary on key international legal developments, from treaty negotiation to dispute settlement.
Our staff are often directly involved in shaping the international legal framework, either as legal counsel, legal advisers, or consultants. This work directly informs teaching on the LLM in International Law, which will give you a knowledge and understanding of both the law on the books and the law in practice.
The School hosts a range of events throughout the year, including public lectures and conferences attracting high-profile speakers and delegates.
Through the recently launched Edinburgh Centre for International and Global Law (ECIGL), leading scholars, judges, practitioners and other experts, will be invited to share their experience of international law through lectures, seminars and workshops.
Contact us
If you have any questions about applying to the LLM in International Law please don't hesitate to contact us.
This programme can be taken full-time over one year, or part-time over two years subject to visa restrictions.
The programme offers a range of specialised courses on issues of contemporary significance that reflect the research interests of members of staff. There is no compulsory course on the programme, which means that you have a large degree of flexibility as to the subjects you may study.
The programme consists of 180 credits, comprising taught courses worth 120 credits (60 credits per semester) and a 10,000 word dissertation worth 60 credits. Full programme details for the 2025-26 academic year are available on the University Degree Regulations and Programmes of Study website.
View 2025-26 programme information for the LLM in International Law
Courses shown below are scheduled for the 2025-26 academic year.
Depending on demand, space on specific courses may be limited.
You must take between 80 and 120 credits of the following courses:
- Diplomatic Law (20 credits, two-semester course)
This module explores one of the oldest branches of international law: the law relating to representatives of States (which in the more recent past was expanded to cover representatives of international organisations and of sub-national entities as well). The course will deal with privileges and immunities, but also with questions relating to duties and functions. It will address the law as it applies to permanent diplomats and ad hoc diplomats, but also consular agents.
- Energy Transition and the International Economic Legal Order: Governance, Challenges and Innovations (20 credits)
The global energy transition is not just a technological or social challenge; it is deeply embedded in international legal frameworks governing trade, investment, and finance. This course examines how international economic law (as well as, to an extent, international environmental law) shapes decarbonisation efforts, from treaty-making and dispute resolution to regulatory innovations in energy markets. Students will explore legal mechanisms for attracting renewable energy investment, phasing out fossil fuels, managing critical materials, and aligning international economic law rules with climate objectives¿gaining insight into the governance challenges at the heart of the energy transition.
- Fundamental Issues in International Law (40 credits, two-semester course)
This is a course aimed at introducing students to fundamental debates about the nature of international law and the international legal order today, and its relationship to states, markets, conflict, justice and human rights. The course is historical, conceptual, theoretical and legal. It introduces students to key ideas and arguments about where the international legal order is coming from and where it is going, what its building blocks are, and how those components are changing. A theme uniting the course is the extent to which the international legal order is shifting from a classical jus inter gentes to something else: a law of global governance, a global administrative law, a law of rights and regulation, or some combination. International Environmental Law (40 credits, two-semester course)
This course explores the institutions, rules, and principles concerning the protection of the environment at the international level. The course is designed as an introductory course in order to develop students' knowledge of the key sources of international environmental law, their understanding of some of the most important treaties in this field, and an awareness of the challenges associated with the development and enforcement of international environmental law.
International Investment Law (20 credits)
This course will give an introduction to the major themes and issues of international investment law. The focus of study is the rules contained in the network of more than 3000 bilateral and multilateral treaties on investment protection, as well as the growing number of decisions by arbitral tribunals in this field. Students will analyse the substantive principles of investment law, such as most-favoured nation treatment, fair and equitable treatment, and the rules relating to expropriation. They will also study mechanisms for dispute settlement in the context of investment disputes, particularly investor-state arbitration. Throughout the course, students will consider the extent to which international investment law draws an appropriate balance between investment protection on the one hand and the ability of states to regulate on key public policy issues on the other hand. Students will also look at the challenges of developing a coherent regime of investment rules.
- Inter-state Conflict and Humanitarian Law (20 credits)
The course will comprise the study of conflict in international law. It will be concerned with the law relating to the resort of armed force by states. The law relating to self-defence will be studied. There will also be a focus on humanitarian law, in particular, on the law relating to entitlement to combatant status, on the law regulating the conduct of hostilities between opposing forces and the law on the protection of civilians in armed conflict. In addition, there will be a study of post-conflict issues. International Climate Change Law (20 credits)
This course seeks to give students an in-depth and interdisciplinary insight into the major legal instruments of international climate change law, including the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol and the emerging mechanisms. Students are expected to have a sound knowledge of public international law. A familiarity with basic economics and international relations theory is also helpful but not essential.
- International Criminal Law (20 credits)
This course focuses on the study of selected foundational aspects of international and transnational criminal law and international co-operation in the administration of justice. It will introduce key topics of relevance to international criminal law and general discussion, including on particular case studies such as the sources of international criminal law, the structure of international crimes (in particular actus reus, mens rea and justifications), but also specific crime categories (in particular, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes). Investment Arbitration: Theory and Practice (20 credits)
This module is tailored for students seeking to further develop their knowledge of international investment law, and improve both their written and oral advocacy skills in investment arbitration. In so doing, students will have the opportunity to substantiate some of the most important stages of investor-state arbitration proceedings and present written and oral submissions. This practical component of the course will be accompanied by theoretical discussion and analysis of current debates surrounding the reform of investor state dispute settlement.
Human Rights and Conflict Resolution (20 credits)
This course will examine the role of human rights in intra-state conflict and in peace processes. In particular it will examine how peace processes and agreements deal with power-sharing arrangements, transitional justice mechanisms, gender equality, and return of refugees. The course will examine the moral, political and practical dilemmas in dealing with these issues, and consider the extent to which human rights law provides useful guidance and requirements, or hinders conflict resolution efforts. The course will also touch on the overlapping requirements of international humanitarian law and international criminal law.
International Human Rights Law (20 credits)
This course will focus on the international law of human rights, primarily through looking at the U.N. system including Charter and Treaty bodies as well as looking at the links between International human rights law and other related fields such as International Humanitarian law and International Criminal law.
International and European Media Law (20 credits)
This course will examine the impact of International and European law on, firstly, the structure of media markets and, secondly, the content of media services. The course will start with a discussion of the nature of the media, the media 'value chain', and the relationship between media freedom, freedom of expression and other human rights. It will examine the various international organisations competent in the media field and the regulatory strategies that are being adopted to deal with media convergence and globalisation. In relation to structural matters, consideration will be given to consolidation of media ownership and state funding of the media, in particular public service broadcasting. In relation to content controls, the course will examine attempts to create a more equitable flow of media content and concerns over 'media imperialism', the regulatory problems posed by pornography and hate speech and the balance to be struck between freedom of the media and privacy.
You will attain a good understanding of the interplay between domestic and international law in this field, as well as the role of soft law and self or private regulation. They will be encouraged to think about the future role of law and regulation in a rapidly changing media environment.
- Law and Power in the Muslim World (20 credits)
This course provides a critical understanding of law's relationship to power and politics in and through the 'Muslim World'. The course introduces diverse critical perspectives that examine the role of law in constructing and challenging global legal hierarchies, particularly as they play out in relation to Muslim contexts and communities. International Ocean Governance and the Protection of the Marine Environment (20 credits)
The course provides an introduction to the fundamental pillars of the modern law of the sea, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as well as the key institutions, processes and actors involved in international ocean governance. It aims to identify opportunities for developing effective and integrated policies for the sustainable development of the seas, as well the challenges and barriers associated therewith.
Law and Development (20 credits)
What, if anything, is development, and what role does law play in its theories and practices?
To answer these questions, the course will consider the history and evolution of some of the major economic theories of development; their translation into diverse political and social policies; and the traces and legacies they have left behind in today¿s development thinking. It will also consider the ideas about law embedded in these theories and the way they have been put into practice. In particular, the course will explore the role of law and institutions in the creation of markets and the allocation of capital and power.LGBT Rights: A Legal Perspective (20 credits)
This course engages with the complex relationship between selected LGBT matters and the legal framework applying to them. Its basis is the treatment which minorities defined by gender identity and sexual orientation have received in human rights law, with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights being particularly important sources. In selected case studies, the course will also deal with the way in which domestic laws have implemented LGBT rights or have provided adopted a restrictive stance on matters relating to sexual minorities.
- New Perspectives on International Law and the Environment (20 credits)
International law and governance mechanisms have not managed to avert the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. This course will introduce students to diverse alternative perspectives that have been proposed to remedy some of these systemic failings, and critically reflect on their potential and limitations.
- Transnational Waste Law and Circular Economy (20 credits)
This course reviews the transnational, European and domestic laws organising the prevention, the recovery and the recycling of wastes, as they relate to the transition to a Circular Economy (reduce, re-use, and recycle). This course consolidates students, prior knowledge of international law by focusing on the overlapping regimes and jurisdictions governing waste-to-resources.
- WTO Law 1 (20 credits)
The aim of the course is to provide students with an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the multilateral trading system. The course will cover the institutional and the substantive law of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which since its establishment in 1995 has played a central role in, among other things, promoting the two underlying principles of non-discrimination and trade liberalisation. After analysing theoretical and practical arguments for and against free trade and the role of institutions in international trade, the course will then focus on the institutional structure and decision-making process of the WTO, including its unique system of the settlement of trade disputes. Students will then explore the key legal disciplines relating to international trade in goods (GATT) and services (GATS), particularly the principle of non-discrimination and market-access rules. In addition, the course will address the central issue of technical barriers to trade.
You will have the option to take between 0 and 40 credits of courses from different subject areas offered by the Law School, depending on availability and with the express permission of the Programme Director. Depending on demand, space on courses outside the core courses may be limited.
Full programme details, including core and optional courses is available on the University Degree Regulations and Programmes of Study website.

Natsuki studied the LLM in International Law in the 2021/22 academic year and graduated in 2022.
""What is unique about this programme is that it brings together people with legal backgrounds and those without. In my year, about half of us, including myself, were from different disciplines such as international relations, political science, etc. The cohort was very international, too. Such diversity created a dynamic atmosphere for discussions in and outside classes. Many professors also tried to incorporate different perspectives and encouraged us to question the ‘classic’ ideas that we tend to take for granted.
Apart from the classes, I received generous support for dissertation writing. My supervisor was passionate from the beginning to help me find a good topic that truly fits my interests, navigate the research and structure my argument. Dissertation writing was a long and intense work, but I’m very satisfied with mine and I wouldn’t have been able to write it in such a way without his supervision.
I felt that the postgraduate office team was very attentive as well. On top of that, this city is so beautiful. The year living in this quiet but lively environment as a student was such precious time. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested!""
Maria, from Greece, studied for an LLM in International Law in the 2019/20 academic year, graduating in 2020. In this video she talks about her experience of studying for an LLM at Edinburgh Law School, life in Edinburgh, completing her studies during the Covid-19 pandemic and her plans for the future.
After graduating with a law degree in Germany, I choose the LLM in International Law at the University of Edinburgh, because it allowed me to select courses in both, public and private international law. This was essential to me, since I was not certain, which area of the law I wanted to pursue in my future legal career. However, I was certain, that I wanted to broaden my horizon from my domestic legal system to the international level. To do this, the University of Edinburgh provided the perfect setting.
In particular, I encountered the fast developing area of Climate Law and was happy to attend many other interesting courses, such as Media Law, as well.
Furthermore, the city itself and Scotland as a whole offer all opportunities you need to have a memorable time with interesting people from all over the world. In retrospect, the time in Edinburgh exceeded my expectations and I am looking forward to come back in the future.

Sarah studied the LLM in International Law in the 2018/19 academic year and graduated in 2019.
The programme all together was an amazing experience. It was challenging and took my knowledge of the law to the next level. Most of my courses focused on International Economic Law and every two-hour lecture I entered I didn’t want to end. I would look forward to the reading list that was never dull nor irrelevant. I enjoyed prepping for and engaging in the class discussions.
We had several guest lectures from international organisations, Academics from other universities, and governmental officials. More importantly, it is extremely satisfying seeing how Edinburgh University has equipped me for my legal profession, and prepared me for the academic career I aspire to end up in.
I loved living in Edinburgh, the city is cosy not too big not too small. It’s safe and the Scottish people are the nicest people I have ever met. Everything is walking distance away; the University campus itself was in the heart of the city and it just made studying and getting around the city very comfortable. The city is filled with history, and fun attractions and activities to do. I like how it’s generally quiet, but with just the right amount of entertainment; like the Christmas market in winter and Fringe Festival in the summer.

You can become a lawyer without a law degree but if you studied an unrelated subject at undergraduate level you'll likely need to complete some sort of law conversion course before taking on the SQE (solicitors) or a Bar course (barristers).
The route to qualify as a solicitor changed in September 2021 with the introduction of the Solicitors Qualifying Exam (SQE). Most new entrants to the sector will need to take the SQE (with the exception of anyone who completed, started, accepted an offer of a place or paid a non-refundable deposit on or for the Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL), Legal Practice Course (LPC) or training contract before the SQE was introduced in September 2021, for a time they may be able to choose whether they qualify via the LPC route or the new SQE route). More information on the SQE can be found here and more generally on qualifying as a solicitor here.
To become a barrister there are three components: the academic component, the vocational component and the pupillage or work-based learning component. To start the vocational component of training, you'll need to pass a postgraduate Bar Training course (formerly the BPTC), which tests your aptitude for critical thinking and reasoning. Before you can start the vocational component of qualifying as a barrister, you will also need to join one of the four Inns of Court: Gray’s Inn, Inner Temple, Lincoln’s Inn and Middle Temple. More information on becoming a barrister and understanding the different routes can be found on the Bar Standards Board website.
If you’re looking to gain experience
No matter the specific profession, working in the law and legal sector requires strong academic credentials, alongside a demonstrable interest and commitment to your chosen career. Employers will look for relevant work experience to accompany your academics. If you’re interested in human rights, voluntary work in the charity sector or in legal clinics will be useful. If a career in commercial law beckons, experiences that expose you to financial markets and big business can develop your commercial awareness.
If you’re early on in your career
Many solicitor firms offer Insight Days and vacation schemes. Vacation schemes usually take place in the second year of your law degree (or final year of non-law degree). Smaller firms may not advertise vacation placements, but you might be able to proactively organise your own. Governments, international organisations, courts, charities, and commercial companies frequently offer internships and traineeships related directly or indirectly to law.
Most barristers' chambers offer mini-pupillages. The principle is similar to vacation schemes but they usually last for a few days and are not formally advertised. Instead, students research chambers and apply directly.
While nothing can replace in-person experience, you might also consider virtual work experience and many firms offer this. LSE students can also access the virtual experience platform Forage.
If you have more experience
There are numerous places to gain further work experience, including:
- Extra-curricular activities: join the LSESU Law Society, take part in mooting, debating etc.
- Volunteering at Citizens Advice, Legal Centres or Pro Bono Clinics, charities or advocacy organisations
- Internships at charities or within the private sector
- Marshalling a judge or sitting/observing court
- Non-legal work experience – look at our list of examples
If you’re changing career
If you are already qualified as a barrister or solicitor, it is possible to cross qualify into an alternate profession by taking the required exams. Exemptions may be possible. Details can be found on the Solicitors Regulation Authority and Bar Standard Boards websites.
In most cases you will need to qualify in the jurisdiction in which you want to practice. Contact the firm or the national legal regulatory body to establish what qualifications are required. Most international law firms will expect an LLM.",46,55.9,London School of Economics and Political Science,12.6,73.5,11945,46,lse.ac.uk,59.5,1764:00,76.8,94.1,United Kingdom,administrative communications,4.477075244106032,0.5367762128325508,649,False,46

The minimum academic entry requirement for the Cambridge LLM is a First Class degree in law from a UK university or its equivalent from an overseas institution. This means you will typically be placed well within the top 10% of law students in your jurisdiction. Students may apply during the final year of their first degree in law. Successful applicants who are studying towards a law degree, other degree, or similar relevant qualification at the time their application is assessed will have an academic condition attached to the LLM offer.
A first degree in law (meeting the requirements of the previous paragraph) is the preferred preparation for the LLM. However, in exceptional and rare circumstances, applicants without such a degree may be considered, provided they can demonstrate that academically they are within the top 10% of lawyers in their jurisdiction. Applicants will typically demonstrate this through substantial relevant professional legal experience or having obtained a professional legal qualification with the equivalent of a First Class result.
Applications are assessed as a gathered field. Candidates are selected for an offer from those meeting the minimum academic requirement, in order of assessed strength of application, but overall offer numbers are limited to the University-allocated LLM quota.
Language requirements
All applicants for the Cambridge LLM programme must provide prescribed proof of English language ability before their application will be considered.
The following details should be noted carefully:
- The Cambridge Law Faculty imposes more demanding English language requirements than other Faculties in the University. These specific requirements supersede any less demanding general University requirements. This is to ensure that applicants have the necessary facility to deal at a sophisticated level with complex legal materials.
- These language requirements are mandatory both as to the level of ability which must be demonstrated and the time at which proof of meeting those standards must be submitted. Applications will not be considered unless they are compliant in both these respects. Given the exceptionally large number of applications for the Cambridge LLM programme, we are not able to entertain requests for individual waivers of these requirements no matter how compelling the circumstances.
Proof of ability
1. All applicants who are nationals of a country on the Postgraduate Admissions Office's 'List A' must provide proof of nationality. These applicants are not required to sit a language test in order for their application to be considered. However, an offer of a place on the Cambridge LLM programme may be made conditional on the applicant providing some prescribed proof of language ability before the offer can be accepted.
2. Subject to the specific exception noted in (3) immediately below, all applicants who are nationals of a country other than those on List A must provide a compliant IELTS or TOEFL language test certificate at the time of application for the LLM programme. The deadline for applying for the 2025-26 programme is 3 December 2024. Applications will not be considered without this documentation.
3. Applicants who are not nationals of a country on List A but who have (or expect to have) successfully completed a three-year full-time university degree in English within the last two years at a university located in a country on list A must provide proof of that programme of study, and are not required to sit a language test in order for their application to be considered. However, an offer of a place on the Cambridge LLM programme may be made conditional on the applicant providing some prescribed proof of language ability before the offer can be accepted.
Required ability level
Where a compliant IELTS or TOEFL language test certificate is required before an application will be considered, the minimum levels of ability which must be demonstrated are as follows:
1. IELTS: At least 7.5 overall with at least 7.0 in each of the individual sections of reading, writing, listening and speaking.
2. TOEFL: At least 110 overall with at least 25 in each of the individual sections of reading, writing, listening and speaking.
Please note that candidates must meet the minimum requirements in all elements of the language test in the same sitting; it is not possible to combine results from multiple tests in order to meet the language requirement.
Deadline for providing proof of language ability
1. Proof of nationality of a List A country, or proof of undertaking a three-year full-time university degree in English at a university located in a country on the PAO's List A, must be provided at the time of application for the LLM programme. The deadline for applying for the 2025-26 programme is 3 December 2024.
2. Compliant IELTS or TOEFL language test certificates, where these are required before an application will be considered, must be provided at the time of application for the LLM programme. The deadline for applying for the 2025-26 programme is 3 December 2024.
Financial requirements
You do not need to provide evidence of your financial position when you apply for the Cambridge LLM (unless you wish to be considered by the University's Cambridge Trust for funding), but you should note that all offers of a place on the Cambridge LLM are subject to a finance condition. If you receive an offer of a place on the Cambridge LLM, you will need to submit a Financial Undertaking Form to PAO to meet the finance condition. This form provides evidence to the University that you can cover the cost of your fees and living expenses whilst studying at Cambridge. Please refer to the Finance section for more details.",5,87.9,University of Cambridge,11.5,100.0,20565,5,cam.ac.uk,95.8,2400:00,97.5,97.4,United Kingdom,"policy, administrative communications",4.473128288309148,0.3535791757049891,904,False,5

“A student using any unacknowledged content generated by artificial intelligence within a summative assessment as though it is their own work constitutes academic misconduct, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the assessment brief.” Plagiarism & Academic Misconduct
This statement aims to provide more specific clarity around the use of GenAI tools in summative assessments whilst allowing for discipline-specific definitions of what is appropriate. The change enables staff and students to engage with these tools more in independent study and formative work, encouraging open dialogue about suitable use, ethical implications, the consequences of over-reliance, what stands to be gained, and what could be lost in the use of these emerging tools. Large Language Models and Generative AI require the use of information to derive their responses so anything generated has already been informed by the work of others without appropriate attribution or reference and as such is a violation of academic misconduct when submitted.
There are a wide variety of use-cases and possible variations across the University so students should always review local guidance from their department or faculty as well as information in the assignment itself.
Guidance for Staff
The information available on this site is designed to support local discussions within departments and faculties and facilitate the development of discipline-specific statements on the use of GenAI in assessments. We recommend using this guidance together with the information available in the Suspected Academic Misconduct – Staff Guidance Document from the Office for Student Conduct, Complaints and Appeals (OSCCA).
When designing and reviewing assessments, we recommend:
- Designing assessments that require information or skills that is more difficult for GenAI tools to replicate such as personal reflection.
- Not relying on AI detection software as it is not proven to be accurate or reliable and provides no evidence to support investigations into the use of GenAI.
- Consider how students, where permitted to use GenAI, should declare their use and describe how it was used within their work.
- Provide clear guidance and rationale for permitting or prohibiting use of GenAI in assessments to support student understanding and compliance
Guidance for Examiners
Examiners across all programmes of study (including Undergraduate, Postgraduate Taught, and Postgraduate Research) are not permitted to upload, copy, or share student work with Generative AI (GenAI) tools and Large Language Models (LLMs). Examiners may not use tools, such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google Bard, or Microsoft Copilot, to analyse work submitted by students and provide written feedback. Due to lack of clarity and uncertainty of how these tools use and/or store input data, it is not permitted to share student IP and submitted work without permission from the student.
Where preferred, however, examiners may use these tools to support their own writing in the process of documenting feedback (e.g., consolidating personal notes and rephrasing comments).",5,87.9,University of Cambridge,11.5,100.0,20565,5,cam.ac.uk,95.8,2400:00,97.5,97.4,United Kingdom,"policy, administrative communications",4.408769037901335,0.5432900432900433,468,False,5

Late or incomplete applications will not be considered. All applications must be submitted to the University’s Postgraduate Admissions Office, not to the Faculty of Law. PAO is the central University office handling graduate applications for all Cambridge Faculties and Departments. Please refer to the PAO’s website for details of how to apply.
You must read the information on the PAO website regarding the documents which you need to submit as part of your application. Please do not submit additional documents such as secondary school certificates, work experience letters or published articles or papers. Significant academic and personal achievements should be included on the application form or on your CV. The LLM Admissions Committee will not review any documents which are not listed on the PAO website as required for LLM applications.
Please be aware that all LLM applicants who are required to take an IELTS or TOEFL language test must submit their test results at the same time as the rest of their application file by the LLM deadline - 3 December 2024. Please see the section of this website about language requirements under the 'Admissions Criteria' heading for full details of the specific language requirement for the LLM.
The Cambridge LLM selection process
Once fully completed applications are received by the PAO, they are forwarded to the LLM Admissions Committee in the Faculty of Law. The Committee considers applications on their academic merits. Decisions made by the LLM Admissions Committee are then relayed to the PAO, which notifies applicants through the self-service page of offers and rejections and, in the case of offers, of any conditions attached.
The LLM Admissions Committee will only start reviewing applications after the closing date, when they will consider the gathered field of more than one thousand applications. While your application is with the LLM Admissions Committee, your self service page status will say ""Under consideration by Degree Committee"". The status will only be updated once the LLM Admissions Committee has made their decision on all the applications. All Cambridge LLM application decisions will be made by 1 March 2025 for the 2025-2026 programme. However, it may take further time before you receive notification. Applicants will be notified of the decision relating to their application via their self-service account by the Postgraduate Admissions Office. The outcome of your application will be available on your online self-service page. If your application is successful, you will also receive a formal offer notification from the PAO by email. If your application is not successful, you will learn about this decision first on your online self-service page. The PAO will also notify you by email. The Law Faculty does not contact unsuccessful applicants.
Please note that we do not operate a waiting list.
Unfortunately, the Admissions Committee is not able to provide feedback to unsuccessful applicants. In addition, the Admissions Committee regrets that it is not possible to consider requests for reconsideration, even in cases where unsuccessful applicants receive further academic results, or are selected for scholarships or other funding tenable at Cambridge.
If you receive an offer of a place on the Cambridge LLM
Accepting the offer
If you receive an offer of a place on the LLM and you wish to accept it, you must formally register your acceptance using your self-service web page and take some additional steps in order to meet the conditions of your offer. All offers of a place on the LLM course are conditional in the first instance, as they automatically come with college membership and finance conditions attached. In addition, applicants who are engaging in academic studies when they apply are likely to have academic conditions attached to their offer.
Please note that any offers of funding which an offer holder might receive are separate from the offer of a place on the LLM programme. All LLM offer conditions must be met before an offer holder can be admitted to the course, irrespective of any scholarships or other funding for which they might have been selected.
Meeting offer conditions
To take up your place on the LLM at the beginning of the academic year in October you must meet the conditions of your offer by the summer of 2025. The PAO specifies the precise date. If you do not do so your offer will lapse. Once you have satisfied the conditions attached to your offer you must send the evidence to the PAO, who will record your conditions as met on your self-service account.
College membership
When the Postgraduate Admissions Office sets your offer your application will simultaneously be sent to the college choices you nominated on your application form. If your nominated colleges cannot offer a place, other colleges will be contacted. Once the process is complete the PAO and the relevant college will notify you of your college membership.
Multiple offers
If in addition to the LLM you have applied for admission to the MCL programme or another University of Cambridge course for the same year of entry and have received an offer of a place, you must choose between the offers. The election is irrevocable and permanent. Please note that no one who accepts an offer to join the LLM programme will be allowed to transfer to the MCL, or vice versa.
Obtaining a visa
If you need a visa to study at Cambridge, obtaining the relevant documentation is your responsibility. Please see the PAO's webpage on immigration for details on the procedure for obtaining a visa to study at Cambridge. Delays can easily occur with the granting of a visa so you should begin the procedure as early as possible.",5,87.9,University of Cambridge,11.5,100.0,20565,5,cam.ac.uk,95.8,2400:00,97.5,97.4,United Kingdom,"policy, administrative communications",4.418428973820885,0.3730242360379346,944,False,5

Please note that online applications will not be submitted, and paper applications will not be processed, until the application fee has been paid in full.What does the admissions process involve?
Once you submit your completed application, it is first received by the UCL Admissions Office. They record applicant details and then assign the application form to UCL Laws if the application is complete. Confirmation is sent to the applicant to say the application is complete and has been sent to UCL Laws. It is UCL Laws who considers the application form and makes a decision. An application is considered complete when all components have been uploaded (personal statement, written work, transcript) and the referee has responded. If your application is missing any documents, the UCL Admissions Office will email you to request the missing documents and the application will not be forwarded to UCL Laws for consideration until everything has been received. Please ensure your referee responds promptly to avoid any delays. Please note your reference will need to come from an institutional address and not from a personal one.All applicants will be informed of their decision via the UCL Applicants Portal by the UCL Admissions Office and not by UCL Laws itself. You can expect to receive a response from UCL around 10 working weeks after your application has been received COMPLETE and processed by the UCL Admissions Office. It can be quicker depending on the time of year and volume of applications to process. If your application is received incomplete, the 10 working weeks will count from you submitting the required documents to make your application complete.
When do I apply?
Applicants who require a visa need to apply by 27th June 2025, 5pm UK time.
Applicants who do not require a visa need to apply by 29 August 2025, 5pm UK time.
Applicants are encouraged to apply as early as possible as we may close early if all places on the programmes are filled.
We also recommend applying as early as possible particularly if you require a decision by a certain date for funding reasons, as it can take around 10 working weeks for a decision to be made from the point that you receive confirmation from the UCL Admissions Office that your application is complete and has been sent to UCL Laws for consideration.
I haven't taken an English language test yet. Can I still apply now or do I have to wait for my test result?
You can still submit an application for the LLM programme if you have not yet taken an English test. We are able to make decisions on applications without an English test providing all other documents have been submitted (transcripts, personal statement, written work and reference). If we would like to make you an offer, it will be conditional upon meeting the English language requirements (and any other requirements if necessary).Does the written work have to be an original piece or can I use an essay I’ve written from a different course?
You may adapt an old piece of work providing it fits the following remit: Your piece of work should not exceed 750 words. It should be a complete piece, not an extract, abstract or summary. It should be on a topic of contemporary relevance in your area of legal interest. Your written work should demonstrate your reasoning and analytical ability and communication n I apply for more than one LLM?
No, you must only apply to one LLM, such as the general LLM or one specialism route. Only one application will be assessed and any further applications will be withdrawn.How much is the tuition fee deposit and is it refundable?
Offer holders for the LLM programme will receive details of the tuition fee deposit and the payment deadline for their deposit in their offer letter. The deposit is not normally refundable, unless for reasons outlined in the tuition fee deposit policy guidelines available here.

Programme website: International Banking Law and Finance
I'm really happy that I chose to study this programme as it not only provides extensive knowledge of the financial sector but also addresses current issues such as Fintech. All of the lecturers are experts in the field, so you know you're learning from the best.
Banking and finance underpins global markets that impact on the day to day activities of businesses and individuals around the world. To work in this high paced legal environment, you are expected to have developed a clear understanding of the regulation and practice of banking at national, supranational and international levels. The LLM in International Banking Law and Finance at Edinburgh Law School caters to those needs.
The principal aim of the LLM in International Banking Law and Finance is to provide postgraduate students with the opportunity for specialised advanced learning in certain key areas of banking and financial law and practice. The programme is forward thinking, considering emerging and developing technologies and their implications on the practice of banking and financing transactions.
The length of courses over one or two semesters plays a key role in fostering deep learning, enabling you to explore a wider variety of subjects in greater depth. You will enjoy significant flexibility in your course choices and can tailor your study to your needs and interests.
The main programme aims are to develop specialist knowledge in banking and finance law and practice, to foster independence of thought, critical reflection and the development of scholarly writing skills at an advanced level in law.
Specifically, this highly specialised LLM programme is suitable for ambitious students and professionals who aspire to pursue a successful career in the field of global financial markets and especially in the areas of:
- finance
- banking
- capital markets
- corporate finance
- financial technology
- accounting and law firms
It is also suitable for those who wish to pursue a successful career with regulatory authorities, central banks, and other public sector organisations. It will help you position yourself as a highly-skilled expert and future leader in the wider area of global financial markets, banking and finance law and regulation.
To enhance and broaden your professional prospects and horizons, some of the seminars in the programme are delivered by leading finance law practitioners/policymakers. This enables the programme to provide you with a good blend of theory and practical expertise.
A successful career in today’s global markets requires an extensive and in-depth knowledge of complex and sophisticated global and domestic finance laws, regulations and practices. This skillset may not be developed without extensive study and a solid understanding of the economic, financial, legal and regulatory theories and practices supporting the operation of global finance.
Based on the University of Edinburgh's strong law and finance expertise, the programme offers interdisciplinary, law and practice-oriented courses examining the legal, economic and political aspects of banking, corporate finance and the relevant regulatory frameworks at national, European and international levels. It also utilises key experience from practice to help you develop practical, problem-solving and drafting skills to handle complex policy, compliance, transaction structuring and completion challenges.
We pride ourselves on delivering intensive, high-quality teaching in small-group settings. This gives you the opportunity to study in detail the topics and subjects above through intellectually rigorous discussions guided by leading academics, including opportunities for feedback.
Seminars are challenging and students regularly present on seminar topics as well as engage in real-life or hypothetical case studies. Through frequent group presentations and by means of testing case studies, prepared and presented collectively by programme students, and students’ own study (revision) groups, you will benefit from the cross-fertilisation of different ideas and experiences. This approach facilitates critical discussion, and enables you to hone your problem-solving, presentation, and team-building skills.
Previous students have had the opportunity to attend guest lectures from high-profile speakers ranging from top regulators, including the European Central Bank and the Prudential Regulation Authority, to highly respected law professors, outstanding economists and lawyers.
This programme can be studied full time over one year, consists of 180 credits, comprising taught courses worth 120 credits (60 credits per semester) and a 10,000 word dissertation worth 60 credits. This programme's structure and courses have been updated for 2025-26 entry. Please visit the Law School's website for further details:

I had the opportunity to develop a broad and solid knowledge of International Law, while being supported throughout this journey by extraordinary academics.
This LLM is ideally suited to those wishing to specialise in public international law and offers you a firm foundation in the fundamentals of the international legal system and international relations.
The programme encourages and supports the development of independent thinking and research skills to prepare students for a career in international law or international organisations.
Courses will cover the theoretical basis for the development of international law, as well as exploring real-life examples and case studies on how rules and principles are applied in practice.
You must complete 180 credits of study – 60 credits are taken in the compulsory dissertation and the remaining 120 credits are taken in taught courses.
Courses will be led by members of Edinburgh Law School academic staff, who are leaders in their field. You are expected to prepare in advance by reading the required materials and by reflecting on the issues to be discussed, and your participation in classes will be assessed.
For the dissertation you will have a supervisor from whom you can expect guidance and support, but the purpose of the dissertation is to allow you to independently design and conduct a piece of research and analysis.
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or lack of demand for particular courses, we may not be able to run all courses as advertised come the start of the academic year.
By the end of this programme, you should have acquired a more sophisticated understanding of the international legal system, international law-making processes, the diverse functions of international law in contemporary society, differing approaches to the subject, and a greater familiarity with research materials and methods.
This programme is suitable for professionally qualified lawyers wishing to practise international law, whether in law firms, at the bar, or as legal advisers in foreign ministries, other government departments, international organisations, or non-governmental organisations.
This programme may also provide the next step towards an academic career specialising in international law. It will also be of value to anyone seeking to develop a career in diplomacy, or international relations.

Course description
An introduction to the theory of graphs.
We will discuss basic concepts and properties of finite graphs (both undirected and directed), covering in particular the theories of Eulerian trails, Hamiltonian paths, trees, tournaments and dominating sets. We will prove the max-flow-min-cut theorem of network theory and apply it to bipartite matching. If time allows, we will further see some more recent topics such as the diamond lemma.
Level: graduate.

Grading and policies
- Grading matrix:
- 100%: homework sets. (The lowest score will be dropped if all homework sets are submitted.)
- Grade scale:
- These numbers are tentative and subject to change:
- A+, A, A-: (80%, 100%].
- B+, B, B-: (60%, 80%].
- C+, C, C-: (40%, 60%].
- D+, D, D-: (20%, 40%].
- Homework policy:
- Collaboration and reading is allowed. However, each of you must write his solutions independently (in his own words) and acknowledge all sources used.
- Asking outsiders (anyone apart from Math 530 students and Drexel employees) for help with the problems is not allowed. (In particular, you cannot post homework as questions on math.stackexchange before the due date!)
- The use of generative AI (ChatGPT, Bard, etc.) in solving problems or formulating the solutions is not allowed. However, it is permitted to consult AI for typesetting and formatting questions.
- Late homework will not be accepted. (But keep in mind that the lowest homework score will be dropped.)
- Solutions have to be submitted electronically via Gradescope. Solutions must be typeset; handwriting will not be accepted! To typeset text with formulas, you can use any of LaTeX (a free online editor is Overleaf), Markdown (a free online editor is Stackedit), LibreOffice (which has a built-in equation editor), Google Docs (which, too, has an equation editor inside), or many other tools. You can even type in a text editor if you use standard conventions to write your formulas in ASCII. In either case, convert to PDF (e.g., by printing to PDF) and submit to Gradescope.
If there are problems with submission, send your work to me by email for good measure.
- Expected outcomes:
- The students should have an understanding of standard concepts of graph theory such as Eulerian tours, trees, matchings, tournaments and Hamiltonian paths. They should know classical combinatorial results such as Hall's marriage theorem, Turan's theorem and the Gallai-Milgram theorem, as well as the max-flow-min-cut theorem on network flows. They should have seen several proof techniques in graph theory and some newer developments such as the diamond lemma.

My areas of research are in trustworthy NLP, discourse, semantics, pragmatics (particularly figurative language and sentiment analysis) and summarization. Please contact me if you are interested in a BA or MA thesis in those topics. Current ideas for thesis topics and areas include but are not limited to the following:
Language Models for Timeline Summarization (BA/MA).
Sebastian Martschat and me developed a submodular framework called TILSE for the generation of timeline overviews such as timelines on long-running wars or other events. One question is whether one can integrate language models into that framework, for example by letting the algorithm work on language model generated summaries of individual articles instead of on the whole article which should also make it more efficient.Bias in Language Models: The case of Sinti and Roma (BA/MA).
It is well known that Language Models reproduce and even amplify bias against minorities. Most research has concentrated on English as well as gender bias but also racial bias against Blacks or religious bias against Jews or Muslims. To the best of my knowledge, there is no work on language model bias against Sinti and Roma. This thesis would establish the first benchmark test suite for bias against Sinti and Roma and evaluate language models against this benchmark.-
Measuring Linguistic Capabilities of Large Language Models(MA).
It is unclear how good the linguistic and metalinguistic capabilities of language models are with conflicting results on grammaticality judgements, dependent on whether you measure via prompting or directly via probability measurements. This work would continue prior work on this topic and extend it towards discourse and pragmatic NLP problems. -
Cryptic Crosswords (BA/MA)
Whereas standard crosswords are an almost solved problem in NLP (at least for English ) , results for cryptic crosswords that use clues needing character-level and phonological knowledge as well as making use of word play and puns are extremely low. This thesis would investigate the use of expert modules (such as anagram solvers) to improve the state-of-the art and/or the integration of fine-grained clue annotation to help LM solvers. If you are interested in algorithms for other word games, instead of cryptic crosswords, this might also be possible.

How to Apply
Unless alternative instructions are given in the project listing, to apply for a project you should send your CV to the contact provided along with a covering email which explains why you are interested in the project and why you think you would be a good fit.
Need help preparing a CV or advice on how to write a good covering email?
The Careers Service are there to help! Their CV and applications guides are packed full of top tips and example CVs.
Looking for advice on applying for CMP projects specifically? Check out this advice from CMP Co-Founder and Cambridge Maths Alumnus James Bridgwater.
Remember: it’s better to put the work into making fewer but stronger applications tailored to a specific project than firing off a very generic application for all projects – you won’t stand out with the latter approach!
Please note that to participate in the CMP programme you must be a student in Part IB, Part II, or Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge.
Want to know more about a project before you apply?
Come along to the CMP Lunchtime Seminar Series in February 2025 to hear the hosts give a short presentation about their project. There will be an opportunity afterwards for you to chat informally with hosts about their projects.

Expected Academic Standard
Applicants for this course should have achieved a UK First class Honours Degree.
If your degree is not from the UK, please check International Qualifications to find the equivalent in your country.
The minimum academic entry requirement is a First Class Bachelor's degree in Law from a UK university or the equivalent from an overseas institution. Successful applicants will typically be placed well within the top 10% of law students in their jurisdiction. Due to the large number of very strong applications received holding a First Class degree in Law (or the overseas equivalent) is not a guarantee of admission.
You may apply during the final year of your first degree in Law. However, if you are still studying at the time your application is assessed then, if you are offered admission, you are likely to have an academic condition. In these circumstances you must meet that academic condition by 31 July 2025 or it will not be possible for you to be admitted.
In exceptional and rare circumstances, you may be considered without a First Class Bachelor's degree in Law provided you can demonstrate that academically you are within the top 10% of lawyers in your jurisdiction eg through substantial relevant professional legal experience or having obtained a professional legal qualification with the equivalent of a First Class result.
English Language Requirements
If you are not a national of a country on the Postgraduate Admissions Office's ‘List A’ then you must take either the Academic IELTS English language proficiency test or the TOEFL English language proficiency test before you submit your application. You must therefore allow enough time to take and pass the language test before the application deadline.
The only exception is if you have successfully completed, or are in the final year of study of, a three-year full-time bachelor's degree within the last two years (from a country in List A).
Applicants must obtain all of the required Academic IELTS test scores or TOEFL test scores in the same test sitting; multiple test results cannot be combined to meet the language requirement. TOEFL MyBest™ scores are NOT accepted. Language test scores must be less than two years old by the start of the course..
Referrals to the University of Cambridge’s Language Centre for assessment are not permitted and it is not possible to obtain a waiver of the language requirement.

Supporting the adoption and integration of generative AI.
This guide is recommended reading for all staff with teaching and assessment responsibilities and is the principal point of reference for heads of department, programme leaders and module leaders. At the meso level, the guide dives deeper into the implications of AI for specific programmes or departments. Starting with apparent employability consequences of generative AI, it connects them to programme and assessment design and some of the practical ways we can address issues arising. We support a balanced approach to AI integration, promoting a variety of applications while also emphasising appropriate use and acknowledgement of AI-generated content.
At present, we advise against integrating generative AI into most summative assessments. There may of course be exceptions to this where the subject of study is generative AI or the outputs are an essential component of the assessment design. One primary concern is that generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot and Claude AI have not been developed by higher education providers, and we do not have control over or oversight of the biases it might produce or the ways in which data are stored and subsequently used. Microsoft Bing Copilot offers greater protection and assurances when used with a KCL account. As we begin to explore ways in which the foundational data can be determined and/ or limited through, for example, customised bots we will evolve a better and deeper understanding of the ways in which we can utilise these technologies for teaching, learning, assessment and feedback. See here for summaries of the 2023-24 College Teaching Fund research projects, many of which explore these possibilities.
Teaching staff members may provide tips and demonstrate the capabilities of generative AI in formative activities, using Microsoft Copliot where possible and making clear the limitations and/or costs of other tools used. Colleagues should remind students of principles of academic integrity whilst engaging in these activities i.e. using generative AI to support learning, not cut corners or produce a final product. Where possible, participation in activities using generative AI should be optional to respect students who do not wish to use these technologies. It's essential to remind students that achieving a first-class grade is entirely possible without any reliance on generative AI.
This is guidance not policy and it is intended to assist decision-making across a range of disciplines at King's. It should be considered alongside the Academic Policy and Procedure which can be found here: Academic Misconduct Policy | King's College London and any faculty or programme level guidance given. If the reader finds any apparent inconsistency between this Guidance and the Academic Policy and Procedure or any other policy then please do note the precedence of Policy over guidance.

If one of the functions of a university programme is to prepare students for the world of work, then it is clearly a duty for us to adapt our programmes to acknowledge changes in that world.
A recent analysis of AI automation exposure shows that law, engineering and business are amongst the most highly at risk industries, with as many as 300 million full-time jobs at risk globally. Given that universities typically struggle to adapt swiftly to change, this likely fast-changing employment landscape connotes profound impacts on many of our programmes; but these are challenges where we might look at the successes of King’s pivot online at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic for inspiration. It adds considerable value for current and future-alert industry intelligence and suggests that we need to be prudent when designing programmes that there is room built in for flexibility with pedagogic and assessment design as well as in terms of what is prioritised in what we teach. Whilst we may instinctively look to detection of generative AI amongst our immediate responses, we should first take opportunities to consider the types of assessments on our programmes and modules where there are vulnerabilities and ways in which we might mitigate impacts of generative AI.
The implications for assessment are significant - all written work and coding are vulnerable. A recent report shows that GPT4 ‘exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers’ (OpenAI 2023).
These tools are only going to increase in effectiveness and prevalence and trying to ignore them, outrun them or prohibit their use are not viable approaches. We should also note that one of the perhaps more obvious ways to challenge this - large scale use of in person invigilated exams - is not considered sustainable nor is it a valid and authentic mechanism for the majority of assessments. Exams remain, of course, a key part of the assessment diet on many programmes but should not be seen as the likely panacea. King’s is committed to maintaining its wider goal to ensure assessment validity, reliability, authenticity, fairness and variety wherever possible.
Assessment design has three key purposes:
These purposes are no more true now than they were a year, five years or decades ago. Generative AI may prompt us to consider the effectiveness of our assessments and the authenticity of them, but where students could (especially with knowledge-focussed take-home assessments) produce work using generative AI, the issue is no greater philosophically than students who might have paid another student to do it or employed an essay mill. The key difference is ease of access and a blurring of the lines between what is self-evidently cheating and what may feel more like legitimate use of technological assistance.
A confident and very able student decides that much of the source material they will use for an assignment has been published in their first language which is not English. They read, process and work in their first language, fully responding to the set task. Running short of time, they put the assignment through a translation tool and, bar a few tweaks and edits they are reasonably happy with the output. However, one section doesn’t sound right so they use a combination of ‘Grammarly’ and ‘ChatGPT’ to re-write it and phrase it in a way they are comfortable with. They submit this work.
There is of course no one correct solution to these questions. Context is fundamental. However, using such vignettes can help staff determine and agree on what is appropriate use and students develop a more critical literacy.
As generative AI tools become increasingly embedded into commonly used suites of tools (see ‘Help me write’ in Google Docs and Copilot for Office 365) so this blurring will be both harder to detect and, in many ways, much harder to track or even be conscious of.
The best way to evaluate current capabilities of Generative AI is to try some of the tools for yourself. It helps to do so in team pairs or clusters to discuss the way prompts are written, the outputs and the implications. In this way, the vulnerabilities to corner cutting, questionable practices or clear breaches of academic integrity become much more evident.
Fact-based, take-away assessments are likely to be the most vulnerable to use of generative AI tools. Whilst an instinctive response may be to look towards in-person invigilated exams or proctored online exams there are many issues with these such as lack of authenticity and validity, a tendency to focus on knowledge recall and the impacts of exam pressure on performance mean they will not be a panacea in either the short or long-terms, though they may provide one option for essential fact-based assessments.
It is worth reviewing knowledge-based assessments and consider ways in which they might be adjusted to:
Given pre-existing worries about essay mills, the vulnerability of essays or other long-form writing is not new, though Generative AI does blur the integrity lines. It is worth considering the nature of questions in essays and ways in which the above advice could inform essay tasks. However, it is also worth considering more fundamental changes to assessments and thinking about the extent to which they are authentic, how much they focus on process (as opposed to the final ‘essay product’) as well as where and how the assessments happen.
Minor changes can be made to assessment questions for essays and examinations with the following caveats (see suggestions on how to tweak summative assessments).
Approaches to Assessment in the age of generative AI, designed by King’s Academy in collaboration with King’s academic colleagues, gives guidance for staff in assessment design from three main perspectives:
See detailed guidance on considerations and approaches to assessment in the age of AI.
It is recommended that Heads of Department discuss this guidance with programme leaders and look for opportunities to streamline processes according to departmental practices, and support programme leaders in their coordination roles. Programme Leaders are advised to do the following:
As stated earlier, it would be impossible at the institutional level to fix a simple regulatory framework beyond the core principles of presenting text or generated text as one’s own (broadly a part of the existing plagiarism policy) and ‘unfair advantage’. However, we set out below four possible starting points for departments and programme leaders. It will be necessary at programme level at least and possibly at module level to discuss and determine which level is appropriate for any given assessment and the specifics therein:
Includes routine and established use of tools such as auto-transcription, spell checkers and grammar check.
Use for clearly delineated tasks as appropriate/allowed/recommended.
May include:
No specific restrictions but with requirement to track key stages/tools utilised. Possible uses may include:
AI use is a feature of the assessment itself. Here the use of generative AI is a focal aspect of the assessment. This may include:
In no circumstance is it appropriate to use generated content verbatim without clear indication and acknowledgement or to effectively outsource the writing task, as much as it is inappropriate to get someone else to write something and claim it as your own.
Moreover, it is important to reflect on the outputs of generative AI as there is a tendency for it to produce information that is biased or false. Students should also reflect on the process they used to generate responses through prompting or how they kept track of key stages or tools used, and/or the effectiveness of using these tools within their learning process.
As recommended for all assessment design, staff should consider the implications of changes or of specific requirements or limitations in terms of potential impacts on students with disabilities and any student with a Personal Assessment Arrangement (PAA).
The core principle: “it is university policy that this work should be expressed in the student’s own words and incorporate their own ideas and judgments” applies.
Where possible, as much foundational work should be dedicated to pre-emptive and preventative measures as possible. Where there is suspicion or evidence (please note section dealing with limitations to and guidance on detection) of inappropriate use of generative AI, colleagues should follow the appropriate university-level and agreed faculty and/or departmental procedure. It is fundamental that accusatory language is avoided and that academic misconduct discussions follow existing procedures. It is worth noting here that many existing detectors have been shown to manifest false positives and that these have a bias towards erroneously flagging students who are non-native speakers of English.
It may be deemed appropriate to call an investigatory meeting. The meeting is to provide an opportunity for the student to meet academics to discuss the assignment concerned and any concerns about the authorship of the work. This meeting is aimed at providing the parties with an opportunity to resolve any misunderstandings at an early stage to avoid a case going to a Misconduct Committee unnecessarily.
There is no hard and fast rule on what should be asked in the investigatory meeting as it will depend on the specific case and the nature of the assessment. The panel will ask questions to help them determine whether the authorship of the work has been compromised, and a key element is to ask the student to show understanding of the work and the process of producing it.
This suggested approach for investigating AI cases is not new. It is almost identical to the existing approach in investigating unfair academic practice/academic misconduct of third-party involvement in assignments, such as the use of contract cheating services and ghostwriters, which has been running smoothly generally with very little complaint of unfairness.
The academics will decide on the probability of whether there is a case to answer and will only refer the case to a Misconduct Committee if they think that it is more likely than not that generative AI was used inappropriately in the assessment. Students should be assured that the faculty panel will be making academic judgment holistically based on all information and factors, they will not rely on a single indicator and students should be reminded that the Misconduct Committee will be independent of the faculty, and will consider the case fully, with the student given a full opportunity to make representations and defend any charges.
If the case is referred to a Misconduct Committee, the Faculty would prepare a detailed referral form listing all the grounds of suspicion. Such a document will be made available to the student not less than 10 working days before the hearing and the student may submit written and oral representations to rebut the charge. If the student is concerned about the fairness of the faculty investigatory meeting or disagrees with the judgment of the faculty panel, these can be raised to the independent panel at the Misconduct Committee.

Please note that eligibility criteria, application procedures and deadlines for applying vary according to the funding provider, so it is essential that you contact the relevant administering office to obtain the precise details for each award for which you wish to apply.
The University has two principal funding bodies which provide full and part funding to students of all disciplines: The Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust and The Gates Cambridge Trust.
Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust
The aim of the Trust is to provide funding to students who would not otherwise be able to take up their offer to study at Cambridge.
The Trust offers part and full cost funding to selected students in all subjects and at all colleges of the University. The majority of awards currently offered by the Trust are for non-EU overseas students, with a more limited number of awards being available to UK and EU students.
Some scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic merit alone but most schemes also take account of financial need. Some scholarships are specifically for law students, such as the Prathiba M Singh Cambridge Scholarship for LLM students, but the majority are not subject-specific.
How to apply: For the majority of Cambridge Commonwealth, European and International Trust funding, those who have received an offer of admission from the University will automatically be considered for the awards for which they are eligible. However, for certain scholarships which the Trust offers in conjunction with partner organisations, prospective students will need to make a separate application.
For further information please see the Cambridge Trust website.
Gates Cambridge Trust
The Gates Cambridge Trust provides prestigious, highly competitive full-cost scholarships. They are awarded to outstanding applicants from countries outside the UK to pursue a full-time postgraduate degree in any subject available at Cambridge.
For further information please see the Gates Cambridge Trust website.
College Funding
For information about possible funding opportunities at colleges, please see the website of the relevant college.

- Access specialist careers support from our in-house Careers Consultant.
- Be a part of our global student community and take advantage of our unrivalled UCL Laws Society which delivers an outstanding programme of activities and events each term.
Why choose this programme?
Taught by leading experts and practitioners, students will gain advanced knowledge in how common problems in corporate law are regulated in different legal systems; how law shapes the economic and financial context within which firms operate, and how it responds to challenges posed by modern financial markets. Students will understand how the legal framework is applied in practice and which issues lawyers and businessmen face in complex corporate transactions.
Who should apply?
Students in this specialism come from a wide array of backgrounds and locations around the globe. Some join the program directly after completing their undergraduate studies, while others have several years of experience practicing law in firms, working in finance, for large corporations, or in public sector roles. Common among them is a passion for exploring key questions at the heart of the corporate economy: How do firms finance their operations? How do they grow and acquire other businesses? What are effective strategies for companies in financial distress? How can corporate law ensure that companies serve not only their shareholders but the broader common good? Please visit our LLM applying and entry requirements to find out the exact requirements for this programme.
Programme structure
The programme is delivered through a combination of seminars, lectures and tutorials. Students are expected to actively participate in class discussions, particularly for seminars and tutorials.
Assessment in taught modules is often by examination, an assessed coursework essay, or through a combination of both. There may be other forms of assessments such as oral presentations, output for audience or group projects.
During the programme, you will research and write a 9000 word Research Essay which counts towards your final grade.
- Full-time students
Terms one and two
During the first week of term one, you will attend the LLM Induction Programme, which includes a series of events to welcome you to UCL Laws and to UCL as a whole, and to complete your formal registration onto the LLM programme.
In the second week of term, you will begin your first classes.
There are ten weeks of classes per term, with a break for reading week after week five. Throughout the term, you will be able to take advantage of the wide range of events held within the faculty and across UCL, including special lectures, mooting, debating and activities organised by the UCL Laws Graduate Law Society.
Term three
Your assessments, including any coursework essays are normally submitted in the first week of term three. All examinations take place during term three and can be scheduled at any time during this term. The examination schedule is published at the end of term two.
During the entire year from September to June you will work on your Research Essay (RE) which will be submitted at the end of term three.
- Part-time students
You will follow the same programme as full-time students above, except for the following:
Your degree will be completed over two academic years In your first year, you will take 90 credits of taught modules In your second year, you will take the remaining 45 credits of taught modules and the 45 credit Research Essay.- You will be invited to attend induction at the start of your first year with the full-time students.
Please note that you will be attending classes with full-time and flexi LLM students. Module teaching can be scheduled between 9am-8pm on weekdays. You will be able to reference the timetable when making your module selections each year.
You will therefore complete module selection twice: once at the start of your programme and again in the summer before you return to your second and final year.
- Modular/ flexible students
You will follow the same programme as full-time students above, except for the following:
You will have up to 5 academic years to complete your degree. You can plan how you would like to complete your 135 taught module credits over that 5 year period based on your personal circumstances (or earlier if you plan to complete the degree in fewer than 5 years).Please note that you will be attending classes with full-time and part-time LLM students. Module teaching can be scheduled between 9am-8pm on weekdays. You will be able to reference the timetable when making your module selections each year.
We will prompt you to select modules each year. You may wish to have a year or more where you do not take any modules; this is possible. It is recommended that you only complete your Research Essay at the end of your degree, in the same year that you are due to complete all of your taught module credits. You will be invited to attend induction at the start of your first year with the full-time students.
Modules
Students will need to obtain a total of 180 credits consisting of taught modules and a research essay to successfully complete the programme. Students choosing a LLM specialist degree are required to select a minimum of 60 credits from the qualifying modules listed below. Students are required to write their Research Essay in the area of the specialism.
Students are advised to plan their modules choices and research essay carefully and in advance. You will select your modules at pre-enrolment, before arrival.
Below is an example of the suite of modules you can expect to chose from. The taught modules offered on the LLM programme vary from year to year. Please note that modules are subject to cancellation and change, including changes in module convenors and type of assessment and the modules listed below are to be confirmed for the 2025/26 session.

(All times are in the CEST Timezone)
A unique conference is planned in one of the best IT hubs in Europe, Munich.
This conference is where academic researchers will meet on an equal platform with representatives from small and large companies, including start-ups, to discuss opportunities and risks in a field that is growing exponentially, AI for the built world.
What algorithms and representations work at full scale? What do the stakeholders in the built world want? What do they not yet know they will want? How does a software tool provide support when there is much uncertainty? Should software provide choices rather than answers? What is destined to fail? There is a lot to discuss, many more questions and many more potential solutions.

From the symposium venue, take the Ubahn line U6 („Garchingforschungzentrum“) to „Garching“ station (one stop). The dinner venue can easily be reached by foot from there.
All symposium venues are easily reachable by public transport.
Munich has an excellent multi-modal public transport system, including buses, trams, the U-Bahn (subway), and the S-Bahn (suburban trains). Details on the zones, tickets, tariffs, and transportation maps are available from the MVV and MVG (local transport authority) websites and apps. Disruptions and changes are announced regularly on these channels, at stations, and in vehicles.
Tickets can be purchased according to zones at stations, in trams and buses, or as a mobile ticket from the DB, MVV, or MVG apps.
Other nearby hotels in Garching City (one metro station away from the venue) include:
– Hotel Marias Inn Bed & Breakfast
– Hoyacker Hof
– Hotel König Ludwig II
If you prefer staying in the city of Munich, we highly recommend booking a hotel along the U6 metro line. Travel time from the city center to the venue would then be less than 30 minutes.
The Bavarian Alps are easily reachable from Munich and are perfect for a day trip.
