--- DOC: University of Cambridge | Cambridge staff perceptions of generative AI | Cambridge Centre for Teaching and Learning
In Cambridge, as across the higher education sector, innovations in generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT are giving rise to concerns among staff and students, as well as perceived opportunities to enhance educational experiences and practices. Concerns are particularly associated with academic integrity and implications for assessment; perceived opportunities include supporting students in developing strategies for academic reading and argumentation. During the Long Vacation of 2023, a short survey was disseminated via membership of the General Board’s Education Committee to faculty / departmental directors of teaching (and equivalent). The survey aimed to elicit short accounts of respondents’ perceptions and some accounts of initiatives within departments and faculties to explore beliefs and practices of staff and students relating to the

--- DOC: University of Oxford | Use of generative AI tools to support learning | University of Oxford
Use of generative AI tools to support learning Overview Part of what a university education teaches is certain academic skills, such as assimilating information, constructing an evidence-based argument and expressing your thoughts in clear, coherent prose. AI tools cannot replace human critical thinking or the development of scholarly evidence-based arguments and subject knowledge that forms the basis of your university education. You can make use of generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, Bing Chat and Google Bard) in developing your academic skills to support your studies. Your ongoing critical appraisal of outputs by reviewing them for accuracy will maximise the potential for AI outputs to be a useful additional tool to support you in your studies. In some instances academic
