Higher education institutions are constantly exploring ways to improve their assessment and evaluation processes to ensure that students receive accurate and fair evaluations of their knowledge and skills. The rise of AI and language model tools like ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) has sparked interest in using these technologies to support assessment and evaluation.
ChatGPT is a newly invented AI that is a free language-modelled tool trained on a wide range of educational topics to ensure that it can provide students with accurate and relevant answers to their questions. The chatbot is designed to understand students’ questions and provide them with step-by-step instructions, links to relevant resources, and expert opinions from other students. To encourage collaboration, the chatbot is programmed to ask students if they would like to share their answers with their peers and provide them with an opportunity to connect with other students working on similar projects. The chatbot has significantly improved students’ access to information and has helped them find answers to their questions faster (Yin et al., 2021).
The alarming consequences of AI in Higher Education
Before I explain the problem, I need to review and compare the traditional and modern evaluations in higher education. Traditional assessment methods in higher education include multiple-choice exams, written essays, and other forms of paper-based assessments. These methods are typically used to test students’ knowledge of specific course material and are graded manually by instructors or teaching assistants. There are some advantages to simple to administer and grade, testing a large number of students in a short period of time, the results being easy to quantify and compare, and disadvantages like limited in their ability to evaluate critical thinking and problem-solving skills, prone to human error in grading and finally not always an accurate reflection of a student’s knowledge and understanding (Dochy et al., 1999; Struyven et al., 2005).
On the other side, we have modern evaluation in higher education, which involves using technology, including AI and language models, to support assessment and evaluation processes (Avdeeva et al., 2017; Fatkullina et al., 2015). This includes using chatbots powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT to provide real-time feedback and grade written assignments. The benefits are providing real-time feedback and support to students, accurately evaluating writing, including grammar, vocabulary, and content, grading assignments quickly and efficiently, reducing the time and effort required by human evaluators and impartial and consistent evaluations, and reducing the risk of human bias. The drawback would be requiring significant investment in technology and training, which may be perceived as less personal than human evaluations and there is still a need for human oversight and review to ensure accuracy and fairness.
The problem is that traditional assessment methods, such as multiple-choice exams, are limited in evaluating a student’s knowledge, and critical thinking skills and the manual grading of written assignments is time-consuming and prone to human error. Traditional assessment methods have limitations, including a focus on factual knowledge and a reliance on manual grading, which is prone to human error. Modern evaluation, with the use of AI and language models, has the potential to overcome these limitations and provide students with more accurate and fair evaluations of their knowledge and skills. However, it is important to balance technology and human interaction to ensure that evaluations are fair and impartial. The problem becomes more critical when the abusage of AI. The chatbot is able to provide students with instant feedback on their writing, allowing them to make improvements in real-time. Here is how ChatGPT respond to the question “Can students misuse ChatGPT?”
“Students can misuse ChatGPT in the assessment process. Here are a few ways in which this could occur:
- Plagiarism: Students could copy and paste content from the internet or other sources into their written assignments, and ChatGPT might not be able to distinguish this as plagiarized content.
- Gaming the system: Students could try to manipulate the chatbot’s grading algorithm by using specific keywords or phrases that they believe will increase their score.
- Cheating: Students could try to use ChatGPT to cheat on exams or other assessments by asking it for answers or using its real-time feedback to improve their scores.
To prevent these types of misuse, it is important to implement safeguards and checks, such as regular human review of the chatbot’s evaluations and random checks for plagiarism. In addition, it is important to educate students about the importance of academic integrity and the consequences of cheating or misusing technology in the assessment process.”
Exploring the advantages of implementing human resource for AI Technology
I can’t say for sure if this is the first time that human resources are preferred to technology, but in my personal opinion, the ability of a human being to detect problems and challenges for the unknown is something that not all AI technologies can understand. We want the evaluation of the students to be fair so to address these challenges and to block students from using AI in the higher education system, institutions can take the following steps:
- Use plagiarism detection software: By using software such as Turnitin or Copyscape, institutions can detect instances of plagiarism and prevent students from using AI to generate answers or written assignments.
- Monitor usage of AI tools: Institutions can monitor the usage of AI tools such as language models by tracking IP addresses and tracking students’ interactions with chatbots during exams and assessments.
- Educate students about academic integrity: By educating students about the importance of academic integrity and the consequences of cheating or misusing AI tools, institutions can discourage students from attempting to use AI in the assessment process.
- Implement secure assessment methods: To prevent students from using AI during exams, institutions can implement secure assessment methods such as proctored online exams or in-person exams in a secure location.
- Conduct regular human review: Institutions can conduct a regular human review of the results of AI-powered evaluations to ensure accuracy and fairness. This can also help to detect instances of cheating or misuse of AI tools.
Even though the above solutions can help to prevent students from using AI, I believe that assessing students with more written exams rather than online assignments is the better solution for this problem.
Conclusion
In conclusion, preventing students from using AI in higher education assessments requires a multi-faceted approach that includes a combination of technology and educational initiatives. The exam should be reviewed regularly, the assignments should be redesigned differently, and mechanisms intensively controlling the materials’ quality should be implemented. Eventually, a position called “Education Material Quality Control (EMQC)” should be created to help higher education institutions improve their students’ quality and avoid the misusage of AI (Hoecht, 2006). By implementing these steps, institutions can ensure that assessments are fair, accurate, and reliable.

We have been deluged with news headlines on who will lead the AI race, the better generative AI tool, and whether the moratorium on AI research will make a dent. At the same time, there is a clamour to keep abreast with legal approaches to establish some regime to reign in the technology, and its creators, who are no less big tech companies which many feel have primarily escaped regulation. The call to pause AI experiments has attracted big names, but remonstrations are insufficient.
We cannot seek respite by adopting a wait-and-see approach. Lessons have been learnt from our lax attitude towards our environment and climate. We have a youth that is seeking inter-generational justice for the irreparable damage that has been perpetrated on our world. As a disciple of sorts of the theory of longtermism, I emphasise that the value of our actions and decisions, or lack of them, will have a significant impact on future generations.
The dissonance between the maleficence and beneficence of AI is apparent – so is the approach to regulate or govern AI tools. With bans by states on generative AI (the Italian ban has since been lifted) and China imposing conditions on content and roll-out of generative AI tools, we are beginning to see the run to regulate.
Setting the characterisation of regulation is essential. Should regulators rely on a prescriptive legal framework, or is a light-touch approach preferred? What overarching principles must guide the form of regulation to be taken? In its recent special issue titled ‘The AI Revolution’, the New Scientist emphasised that transparency will be key to regulating new technology. This is but one view of a myriad of opinions. One may argue that any regulatory regime’s central aim must be accountability. Developers and deployers of AI tools must be held accountable to any standard or measure imposed on them, whether through ethical or legal normative frameworks.
Ethical frameworks have been adopted, or are in the process of being drawn up, by state and non-state actors to promote accountability – using terms such as “altruistic AI”, “Responsible AI”, or “Trustworthy AI”. International organisations, tech corporations, and nation-states have contributed to a large inventory of these guidelines. The aim of these guidelines is for developers and deployers of AI systems to apply a set of values when making ethical considerations within a sandbox before unleashing these AI systems. The adoption of such frameworks promotes a manner of self-governance – a kind of soft law – that serves to encourage a degree of governance of AI without impeding its innovation. The risk with such an approach is that it could be reduced to ethics washing.
The UK government is promoting a pro-innovation, light-touch approach to regulate AI, announced recently on 29 March, with the publication of its White Paper. Not surprisingly, tech businesses, investors, and AI research centres have welcomed it. The proposal promotes five principles that provide the scaffolding of a regulatory sandbox to be adopted by developers and deployers of AI systems and lists future follow-up actions on the part of the government to issue guidance, tools, and risk assessment templates to operationalise these principles. These five principles are – safety, security and robustness; transparency and explainability; fairness; accountability and governance; and contestability and redress. Whilst the list may appear to be a rather minimalistic distillation of principles contained in AI ethical frameworks, we can be assured that it is but the first iteration.
While many have criticised this approach, the proposal clearly indicates that this first step may evolve into legislation “…to ensure regulators consider the principles consistently.”
A more prescriptive proposal seen as the first step to legislate on AI was proposed in April 2021 – the EU Artificial Intelligence Act. And on 27 April 2023, a preliminary agreement was reached amongst the members of the European Parliament to push it along to its enactment. The law’s main aim is to create an environment of trust in the use of AI systems by classifying the levels of risk of the AI system that could lead to AI systems being banned or subjected to strict, minimal or no obligations.

We have been deluged with news headlines on who will lead the AI race, the better generative AI tool, and whether the moratorium on AI research will make a dent. At the same time, there is a clamour to keep abreast with legal approaches to establish some regime to reign in the technology, and its creators, who are no less big tech companies which many feel have primarily escaped regulation. The call to pause AI experiments has attracted big names, but remonstrations are insufficient.
We cannot seek respite by adopting a wait-and-see approach. Lessons have been learnt from our lax attitude towards our environment and climate. We have a youth that is seeking inter-generational justice for the irreparable damage that has been perpetrated on our world. As a disciple of sorts of the theory of longtermism, I emphasise that the value of our actions and decisions, or lack of them, will have a significant impact on future generations.
The dissonance between the maleficence and beneficence of AI is apparent – so is the approach to regulate or govern AI tools. With bans by states on generative AI (the Italian ban has since been lifted) and China imposing conditions on content and roll-out of generative AI tools, we are beginning to see the run to regulate.
Setting the characterisation of regulation is essential. Should regulators rely on a prescriptive legal framework, or is a light-touch approach preferred? What overarching principles must guide the form of regulation to be taken? In its recent special issue titled ‘The AI Revolution’, the New Scientist emphasised that transparency will be key to regulating new technology. This is but one view of a myriad of opinions. One may argue that any regulatory regime’s central aim must be accountability. Developers and deployers of AI tools must be held accountable to any standard or measure imposed on them, whether through ethical or legal normative frameworks.
Ethical frameworks have been adopted, or are in the process of being drawn up, by state and non-state actors to promote accountability – using terms such as “altruistic AI”, “Responsible AI”, or “Trustworthy AI”. International organisations, tech corporations, and nation-states have contributed to a large inventory of these guidelines. The aim of these guidelines is for developers and deployers of AI systems to apply a set of values when making ethical considerations within a sandbox before unleashing these AI systems. The adoption of such frameworks promotes a manner of self-governance – a kind of soft law – that serves to encourage a degree of governance of AI without impeding its innovation. The risk with such an approach is that it could be reduced to ethics washing.
The UK government is promoting a pro-innovation, light-touch approach to regulate AI, announced recently on 29 March, with the publication of its White Paper. Not surprisingly, tech businesses, investors, and AI research centres have welcomed it. The proposal promotes five principles that provide the scaffolding of a regulatory sandbox to be adopted by developers and deployers of AI systems and lists future follow-up actions on the part of the government to issue guidance, tools, and risk assessment templates to operationalise these principles. These five principles are – safety, security and robustness; transparency and explainability; fairness; accountability and governance; and contestability and redress. Whilst the list may appear to be a rather minimalistic distillation of principles contained in AI ethical frameworks, we can be assured that it is but the first iteration.
While many have criticised this approach, the proposal clearly indicates that this first step may evolve into legislation “…to ensure regulators consider the principles consistently.”
A more prescriptive proposal seen as the first step to legislate on AI was proposed in April 2021 – the EU Artificial Intelligence Act. And on 27 April 2023, a preliminary agreement was reached amongst the members of the European Parliament to push it along to its enactment. The law’s main aim is to create an environment of trust in the use of AI systems by classifying the levels of risk of the AI system that could lead to AI systems being banned or subjected to strict, minimal or no obligations.

A University of Chester team leader has been named a winner of a national award recognising her innovative work, achievements and impact in learning technology.
Laura Milne, Head of Digital Education, at the University’s Centre of Academic Innovation and Development (CAID), was presented with an individual ALT (Association for Learning Technology) Award yesterday (September 4).
The Awards celebrate excellent research and practice and outstanding achievement by individuals, teams and organisations who are delivering and developing communication, information and related technologies to support learning, teaching and assessment. Established in 2007, the Awards have set a benchmark on a national scale and attract competitive entries from the UK and internationally.
Laura joined the University in spring 2023, and leads on educational technology strategy and vision, supporting a wide range of colleagues across the institution and beyond with digital innovation. She is head of a team of learning technologists and works with colleagues, including in the CAID and Library and Information Services, and with staff and students in the University’s three Faculties and 11 Schools.
The ways she is making a difference include transforming the University’s Virtual Learning Environment, Moodle, which provides a connected space for online course materials, with exceptional feedback reflecting on aspects such as the improved ease of access to information across the platform.
Simon Birkett from Jisc - the UK not-for-profit organisation that provides network and IT services and digital resources in support of further and higher education and research as well as public services - commented that (the transformation work undertaken) clearly aligns to Jisc’s transformation framework, and “she has contributed to the development and refinement of these materials which will impact across the whole higher education sector in the UK"".
She has also been pivotal in plans and guidelines for staff and students on the ethical, responsible and cautious use of Generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) and the University’s selection as one of only seven institutions nationally to pilot a Generative AI tool to support teaching, is testament to her work and leadership.
The Award also acknowledges Laura’s work with students as partners, working as content developers to develop podcasts, video resources and more as part of a funded project on the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL).
In addition, Laura and her team are sharing their work and learning for the benefit of others at events and via papers, blogs and other articles.
Laura, who is also a Fellow of Advance HE, and has been active in digital education in the UK, USA and South Africa, said: “I feel honoured to be recognised for this Award, particularly when reflecting on how my work has been appreciated across the university and wider sector. I am grateful to work with such excellent colleagues to inject enthusiasm and build great technology-enhanced learning for our students. While this is an individual award, it’s community that’s at the heart of excellent teaching and learning experiences.”
Professor Jackie Potter, Dean of Academic Innovation at the University of Chester, who nominated Laura for the Award added: “Laura is a very worthy winner of the ALT individual Award.
“She places students and staff at the centre of her work, and her innovation, expertise, creativity and enthusiasm are having a significant impact.
“In a short time, she has made a mark on how we approach and use educational technology at the University of Chester for the better, for students and staff, which is being noticed nationally and reaching far beyond the university to the benefit of many more.”
All entries in the ALT Awards are reviewed by an independent judging panel chaired by the President of the ALT.

Law INTRODUCTION
Law at Winchester is taught through skills-based learning. You will learn how to: master a negotiation, conduct a mediation, interview a client effectively and become proficient in legal research. You will perfect your communication skills through mooting (presenting an argument to defeat your opponent in court) in our new moot courtroom, where you may find yourself discussing anything from third-party rights when downloading music, to workplace discrimination. Our close links with the legal profession enrich your experience.
You will have the opportunity to undertake ‘pro bono’ legal advice work in our Legal Advice Centre and attend workshops run by practising solicitors and barristers. Law graduates are also highly valued in many industries including management, finance, HR, education, local and central government and the voluntary sector.

James Bragg - BSc (Hons) Computer Science
I am delighted to be studying at my first university choice, the University of Bedfordshire, I will be heading into my second year of studies of my BSc (Hons) Computer Science course.
Whilst studying in my first year, I developed and improved on many vital skills such as teamworking, communication, and the value of these skills for my future career. I gained many skills to help me as a self-dependent learner. For example, how to undertake my own research and how to make best use of the fabulous facilities the University of Bedfordshire has to offer its students. An impressive example of the facilities available to students is the University Library, which was an ideal place when working in a syndicate to develop one of my software projects.
The facilities the University offers are excellent, and I believe these are helping to make my education the best. Especially, the new STEM building which offers many excellent modern resources for my Computer Science course. The facilities available have given me a clear picture of what working in the computing industry could be like. The University of Bedfordshire has worked hard to ensure that there were plenty of online resources available during the COVID-19 pandemic. The online lectures and practical online sessions, helped to make online learning as good as face to face teaching.
Marcin Frackiewicz - BSc Computer Science and Software Engineering
For the first time in my life, I can't wait to go back to school. I had a great time in my first year working on projects, attending events and lectures, even studying for exams. I met lots of people with whom I have great relations.
Recollecting all the projects, events, even studying for exams or some funny lecture that I spent time on together with my great friends I met at the University of Bedfordshire fills me with joy.
Projects have given me opportunities to co-operate, act as part of a team with my peers and develop standalone applications. I have experienced a variety of scenarios, this has given me a deeper understanding of how to approach them.
I happily recall brainstorming with my team mates over those projects. Towards the end, the last few days before the deadline, spending time together designing presentations and rehearsing them to perfection to highlight our hard work.
I am excited to enter the second year of my course, to attend all those new captivating units, spend time with interesting people and work hard to experience self-realisation.
Achieving goals is all about first steps and persistence. Believe in yourself, carry on and you shall experience fulfilment
Vladut-Costel Botezatu - BEng Mechanical Engineering
I have always been fascinated by mechanical engineering and how things are made and how they finally work. This is why I am now a student studying Mechanical Engineering in the School of Computer Science at the University of Bedfordshire.
Since the first year of my studies I had access to a lot of information that I was interested in, and I have learned how to create mechanical drawings using software such as AutoCAD and simulator like Ansys.
The most important thing that I have learnt and understood during my second year is how engines work, for example, Otto and Diesel engines.
I enjoy the fact that we have lot of projects, these projects are really useful, as they give us the opportunity to practice what we have learned. The projects have also helped me to improve my communication skills as well as my ability to work as part of a team.
I am eager to see what I will learn in my third and final year of studies. I am sure I will have a great opportunity in the future to work in a domain related to my studies, as I have always wanted.
I would also like to say, I am really thankful to our lecturers, they are always dedicated and they are always there to help, especially during online courses.
During the third year, we shall be continuing with the project ‘Formula 1’ guided by a senior lecturer at the university. This project entails designing and assembling a racing car, in a competition with other universities.
I can't wait to resume this project which began in the second year, but due to the pandemic it was postponed. I’m very excited about being a part of this project, working in a team and learning a lot.
Kautilya Reddy Chappidi - BSc (Hons) Artificial Intelligence and Robotics
As soon as my classes started, I was intrigued by the sheer infrastructure, from the Main Campus to the Library. I wanted to learn more of what had happened in class and I stumbled into the library.
It is a wonderful place to study in, open 24/7, with access to all the books I need. Also isolated self-study areas for Individuals and Groups, and it is right in front of the Student Accommodation.
Being an International Student I never felt isolated, as my classmates were
from various parts of the world. This broadened my horizons as I was learning from various perspectives. There was enough time after class for me to not only brush up on what had already happened but also for me to start my own little projects.
The highly experienced Professors and Seniors I met in a hackathon, guided me through my projects with multiple tips and tricks. The STEM building is equipped with multiple Labs, not just limited to PC’s but are also equipped with 3D Printers and Robots, like InMoov.
The various hackathons conducted by the British Computer Society are a great place to socialise with others and also discuss various projects others have been working on.
My interests revolve around 3D Modelling, 3D Printing, Artificial Intelligence, Electronics and Robotics. I joined the University of Bedfordshire in February 2020, studying for a BSc in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.
Charlie Jessop - BSc Information and Data Systems
I joined the University of Bedfordshire studying part-time as part of an apprenticeship with one of the largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the world. Through a variety of lectures and assignments, I am building great knowledge and technical bases, learning various skills and programming languages that open up many opportunities in the data science field. Alongside the technical concepts, the coursework has provided many opportunities to build soft skills which are vital for success in my studies and day-to-day work. I have found the lecturers to be very approachable and are available for support when needed.
My role involves building tools and data visualisations within Unilever’s Safety and Environmental Assurance Centre (SEAC), which looks after over 400 brands worldwide. My work can feed into new systems we are developing or handed directly to the scientists to analyse their data.
To carry out these tasks, I am often required to use popular programming languages and to interact with various data types/structures, which are all concepts that the University has taught me.
My studies at the University have given me a platform to engage in conversations with my colleagues, articulate my ideas and get involved in things that I would not have seen myself doing when I finished sixth form. I cannot wait to enter the final year of my degree to continue my development and apply what I have learned to an exciting new project.
Shehu Aminu (Ashman) Shehu – BSc (Hons) Computer Science and Software Engineering
I am really excited and pleased to be a student at the University of Bedfordshire and am now in Year 2 of my BSC (Hons) Computer Science and Software Engineering studies.
During this time I came to appreciate the value of working and co-operating with my fellow students, listening to and having respect for other people's views and feelings, and developing skills as an independent self-directed learner - as well as maintaining a healthy balance between study and leisure time.
The facilities at the University are excellent and have allowed me to develop both theoretical and practical skills during my first two years of study. The knowledge and practical skills I am gaining are heling me achieve my dream of a career in IT – and, I recognize that they are providing many opportunities for me at the end of my studies.
At the start of my first year, my chosen course BSc (Hons) Computer Science and Software Engineering was a completely new and exciting experience for me and I am really pleased that I chose this path of study. In fact, study during my first and second years proved both really wonderful and amazing because I have achieved so much from my lectures, practicals and seminars.
The practical sessions were supportive to me because they provided an opportunity to implement the knowledge acquired throughout the lectures and seminars. I have gained a lot of experience and ideas as a result of working in group projects. This helped me developed the soft skills needed to be an effective team member.
I know it seems hard sometimes, but remember one thing: through every dark night, there’s a bright day after that. So, no matter how hard it gets, stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it.
I found that I had to work harder during my second year through self-study, research in the University's well-equipped and functional digital library - as well as getting support from my teachers and staff who were always there for me whenever I needed help the most. These are the reasons for my success in my second year.
Believe in yourself and don’t let anybody stop you from doing what you have to do to make you happy....
I think we can make it, in fact, I’m sure. If you fall, stand tall and come back for more, but you must keep moving to get to the end.
In my final year, I want to challenge myself even more undertaking the Year 3 Project which will enable me to study and develop my specialism in greater depth.
Thanks to all my teachers and staff for always being there for me and encouraging me, and I appreciate all the effort, support and help you have given to me.
On a final note: If you want to be broad-minded; if you want to receive functional, career-orientated education; if you are an ambitious student and you want to make the sky your limit; if you want to be a balanced intellectual; if you want to be a real productive scientist, engineer or technologist, then, surely, you must opt for University of Bedfordshire.
Arya Elpula – BSc (Hons) Computer Science
Going to university is a choice I will always be proud of and I feel really connected to the community around the campus when it comes to making friends or just gathering together to undertake a project. The BSc I chose to study (BSc HONS in Computer Science) focuses on topics such as data processing, networks, computer software and artificial intelligence where we are allowed to investigate our own topics and create and analyse the results.
At first programming was not my forte as it was hard for me to focus on it every day especially in first year where coding guidelines and methodologies were different to what I would have expected.
However, after a lot of practice and self believe, thanks to the teachers and staff who have been there for me constantly communicating via email or vis-à-vis and giving regular feedback without any formalities, I became more at ease in this environment and much more confident in myself. I gained and enhanced my transferrable skills which I have come to realise are vital to improving my employability.
During my first and second year of study, whenever we reached a milestone in our projects, I was filled with a sense of success, motivation and sense of completeness, and came to realise there are no limits if you keep pushing yourself.
The second year helped me with decision making as I learnt statistics and maths helping me to thnk in terms of algorithms and data structures such as sorting, searching and graph algorithms. It helped me address how important data is, the philosophy of AI and machine learning as well as biological data computation.
I am glad I will be going into my final year as a university student, and am currently gathering ideas about potential projects as well as networking with potential employers - helping me develop an insight into the IT Industry.
The University of Bedfordshire has been very supportive and patient with my progress, and going back and seeing my friends and teachers will keep me motivated and focused on the work at hand. I could not have excelled without the effort of my colleagues and staff.
If I had the chance to give advice to myself back in first year it would be something subtle like:
Never stop creating goals in your life. It isn’t about the completion of it but the journey to it. You can’t appreciate the good times without the bad ones.
Ionut-Cosmin Theodorescu – Computer Science BSc (With Foundation Year)
I always dreamed of studying abroad, interacting with people from different parts of the world and working together towards a common goal.
I found the Foundation Year extremely useful as it introduces you into the University study core, thanks to the teachers who have a unique passion for teaching. I felt supported all the time.
The decisive year for me was the 2nd year for I was to interact with the Careers and Employability Service as it was recommended by one of the lectures. Also, in that year I was encouraged by Careers and Employability Service to attend an Employability Unit, I opted for a Spanish Class which was held by the University of Bedfordshire. Adding another foreign language to the CV is always a big plus.
The University of Bedfordshire gave me the confidence to fulfil my dream and to secure my future.
The Careers and Employability Service did a phenomenal job at guiding and preparing me for the future interviews. With what I have learned in the past years I have managed to combine the soft skills and the knowledge that I have achieved up to now, in order to secure a Placement Year Position thanks to the University of Bedfordshire and to the teachers who have inspired me.
Next year I am looking forward to expanding my skills and to achieve even greater goals, this could not be possible without the help of the teaching team that have done a great job of pointing us with wisdom towards our goal. Thanks to them and to the University of Bedfordshire our future is secured.
Solange Yehouenou - BSc Computer Science and Software Engineering
When I decided to go back to school, I was determined but I was scared too. Being a mum had a lot to do with my fears.
I wasn't sure if I could make it all the way to the end. But here I am now, having just passed all the units of my second year and on my way to my final year.
I tell you this now, it has been an amazing experience. At first, it was overwhelming especially with the coding and all the different programming languages.
Many times, I felt panicky and left behind, but then the group assignments were launched and together with other students I started feeling like I was part of something wonderful. We shared our knowledge, research our subjects, but also shared our moments of panic and victories.
I believe that when you want it bad enough, then you realize that your wings already exist; All you have to do is FLY..
My second year was more focused because I knew what to expect. The lessons were designed as presentation slides and easy to follow; the practical sessions allowed us to ask questions and get help from our teachers. There were regular breaks every few hours and students can meet up for a cup of tea or coffee to exchange views or have a laugh etc...
I want to thank all my teachers and university staff who were always ready to guide, encourage, help and inform me whenever I needed it. Without you, it wouldn’t have been possible to get this far. God bless you all.
I am very excited at the thought of starting my final year. I know how challenging this is going to be. I am gathering ideas about potential projects that I’m going to work on and above all, I can't wait to get back to the bubbly, multicultural environment of the Bedfordshire University and see all my friends and teachers again.
Joshua Peach - FdSc Construction Management
I have really enjoyed the course so far, I have found as the course has developed my on site knowledge the two have merged into one and now I am working hand in hand with what I study on the course with what I deal with on site on a daily basis.
The course so far has given me a much wider perspective of construction as a whole, rather then just day to day site management. Something I believe can only lead me in good stead moving forward in the industry.
I am looking forward to moving on to the 'top up' and further developing knowledge on different areas of the sector. As the course will be in the fourth year I feel I am best place to balance my work and University work, work load something I have at times found hard.
Finally, I am extremely looking forward to getting stuck into my dissertation and reviewing areas of construction I feel strongly about.
Arsalan Naveed - Computer Science and Software Engineering (with Foundation Year)
I feel lucky to be part of Bedfordshire University, it's not just University but it’s a home with multicultural. I have learnt a lot in the past two years and I’m very excited for my final year.
I am very thankful for the teachers and staff who helped me a lot with everything that I needed. They are always available to support and keep me motivated towards the future by introducing not just me but everyone at University with potential employers for our future career.
Through my experience at University with projects and assignments, I would say:
Set a goal and go for it, never change the goal but be flexible with the approach.

Justyna Kurczaba - Student Computer Science BSc
My name is Justyna Kurczaba and I study Computer Science BSc at the University of Bedfordshire.
Prior to starting my journey I never had any experience in computing. Therefore I am overwhelmed with the progress I was able to make during the recent months of my education.
Learning to program felt intimidating at the beginning of the last academic year. I was not feeling confident when tutors were passing by and looking at my code. However, after a lot of practice and determination I was able to produce a satisfying piece of code. This was one of the most memorable and empowering moments of my life. It was also a milestone to my current, small success. Suddenly, I felt this indescribable motivation to become my own teacher. Weekly worksheets uploaded by course coordinators provided me with enough information to create my own independent projects. Also group projects were also incredibly beneficial to my improvement. Not only did I exchanged my knowledge and skills with other team mates but also I discovered how important communication is.
In this University you are not just a student but you will feel you are part of a big family.
Moreover, I was challenged to go out of my comfort zone and I had to seek assistance from tutors which was a bit daunting for me. However, they approached me with patience and understanding which encouraged me to further develop my skills. Even though lectures and practical sessions were held only three times a week I was able to find an abundance of supporting materials in the library which was more than sufficient while learning on my own.
I am incredibly grateful to be presented with an opportunity to study at the University of Bedfordshire where I met inspiring people who contributed to my growth.
Justyna 26, has also been rewarded for commitment to her studies with the BCS (The Chartered Institute of IT) Bedford Branch Student Prize which is given every year to the highest performing first year computing student in the University’s School of Computer Science and Technology.
Justyna had no experience of computing until she came to the University, but in her first year she excelled in her studies to become the highest performing student in her cohort achieving the highest possible grades for all subjects.
Justyna’s prize includes automatic membership of the BCS for the remainder of her studies and a £150 cash prize. Her certificate was presented by the Chair of the BCS Bedford Branch Dr Ip-Shing Fan from Cranfield University.
It is great to see such dedication and hard work, and is great that we can reward it through the kind sponsorship of BCS.

Faisal Hoque - 2nd Year Computer Science Student
After successfully passing my first year; during the summer holidays I was encouraged by a certain staff member to help fellow students who started Year 1 in February. I was reluctant at first due to my lack of confidence. However, it was a wonderful opportunity to improve this aspect of myself, so I decided to help the February students out whenever I could. This alone empowered me so much to continue improving my confidence and soft skills, that I decided to also help my fellow students who were working on referral assignments.
I was also encouraged to join the University of Bedfordshire BCS Student Chapter (also called Beds Computing SU Society) and to help run it during my Year 2 studies. I initially took the position of Vice-Chairman while a friend took the role of Chairman but after a month or so of running a few events I eventually took over the role of Chairman.
The skills I’ve learnt and opportunities I’ve gained since first joining the University in 2016, would not have been possible if it wasn’t for the extraordinary teaching staff within the CST School. My personal view from what I’ve experienced and heard from other students; a university is only as good as the students who make the most of it. There are so many opportunities and advantages available at the University of Bedfordshire, and it’s about engaging and seeking those opportunities for yourself
Dorcas Sunday - BSc Computer Security and Forensics
I must say, I am blessed to be a student at the University of Bedfordshire. In University of Bedfordshire there are lots to achieve not just studying alone. It is a home for international student (it is warm and friendly).

James Bragg - BSc (Hons) Computer Science
I am delighted to be studying at my first university choice, the University of Bedfordshire, I will be heading into my second year of studies of my BSc (Hons) Computer Science course.
Whilst studying in my first year, I developed and improved on many vital skills such as teamworking, communication, and the value of these skills for my future career. I gained many skills to help me as a self-dependent learner. For example, how to undertake my own research and how to make best use of the fabulous facilities the University of Bedfordshire has to offer its students. An impressive example of the facilities available to students is the University Library, which was an ideal place when working in a syndicate to develop one of my software projects.
The facilities the University offers are excellent, and I believe these are helping to make my education the best. Especially, the new STEM building which offers many excellent modern resources for my Computer Science course. The facilities available have given me a clear picture of what working in the computing industry could be like. The University of Bedfordshire has worked hard to ensure that there were plenty of online resources available during the COVID-19 pandemic. The online lectures and practical online sessions, helped to make online learning as good as face to face teaching.
Marcin Frackiewicz - BSc Computer Science and Software Engineering
For the first time in my life, I can't wait to go back to school. I had a great time in my first year working on projects, attending events and lectures, even studying for exams. I met lots of people with whom I have great relations.
Recollecting all the projects, events, even studying for exams or some funny lecture that I spent time on together with my great friends I met at the University of Bedfordshire fills me with joy.
Projects have given me opportunities to co-operate, act as part of a team with my peers and develop standalone applications. I have experienced a variety of scenarios, this has given me a deeper understanding of how to approach them.
I happily recall brainstorming with my team mates over those projects. Towards the end, the last few days before the deadline, spending time together designing presentations and rehearsing them to perfection to highlight our hard work.
I am excited to enter the second year of my course, to attend all those new captivating units, spend time with interesting people and work hard to experience self-realisation.
Achieving goals is all about first steps and persistence. Believe in yourself, carry on and you shall experience fulfilment
Vladut-Costel Botezatu - BEng Mechanical Engineering
I have always been fascinated by mechanical engineering and how things are made and how they finally work. This is why I am now a student studying Mechanical Engineering in the School of Computer Science at the University of Bedfordshire.
Since the first year of my studies I had access to a lot of information that I was interested in, and I have learned how to create mechanical drawings using software such as AutoCAD and simulator like Ansys.
The most important thing that I have learnt and understood during my second year is how engines work, for example, Otto and Diesel engines.
I enjoy the fact that we have lot of projects, these projects are really useful, as they give us the opportunity to practice what we have learned. The projects have also helped me to improve my communication skills as well as my ability to work as part of a team.
I am eager to see what I will learn in my third and final year of studies. I am sure I will have a great opportunity in the future to work in a domain related to my studies, as I have always wanted.
I would also like to say, I am really thankful to our lecturers, they are always dedicated and they are always there to help, especially during online courses.
During the third year, we shall be continuing with the project ‘Formula 1’ guided by a senior lecturer at the university. This project entails designing and assembling a racing car, in a competition with other universities.
I can't wait to resume this project which began in the second year, but due to the pandemic it was postponed. I’m very excited about being a part of this project, working in a team and learning a lot.
Kautilya Reddy Chappidi - BSc (Hons) Artificial Intelligence and Robotics
As soon as my classes started, I was intrigued by the sheer infrastructure, from the Main Campus to the Library. I wanted to learn more of what had happened in class and I stumbled into the library.
It is a wonderful place to study in, open 24/7, with access to all the books I need. Also isolated self-study areas for Individuals and Groups, and it is right in front of the Student Accommodation.
Being an International Student I never felt isolated, as my classmates were
from various parts of the world. This broadened my horizons as I was learning from various perspectives. There was enough time after class for me to not only brush up on what had already happened but also for me to start my own little projects.

However, after a lot of practice and self believe, thanks to the teachers and staff who have been there for me constantly communicating via email or vis-à-vis and giving regular feedback without any formalities, I became more at ease in this environment and much more confident in myself. I gained and enhanced my transferrable skills which I have come to realise are vital to improving my employability.
During my first and second year of study, whenever we reached a milestone in our projects, I was filled with a sense of success, motivation and sense of completeness, and came to realise there are no limits if you keep pushing yourself.
The second year helped me with decision making as I learnt statistics and maths helping me to thnk in terms of algorithms and data structures such as sorting, searching and graph algorithms. It helped me address how important data is, the philosophy of AI and machine learning as well as biological data computation.
I am glad I will be going into my final year as a university student, and am currently gathering ideas about potential projects as well as networking with potential employers - helping me develop an insight into the IT Industry.
The University of Bedfordshire has been very supportive and patient with my progress, and going back and seeing my friends and teachers will keep me motivated and focused on the work at hand. I could not have excelled without the effort of my colleagues and staff.
If I had the chance to give advice to myself back in first year it would be something subtle like:
Never stop creating goals in your life. It isn’t about the completion of it but the journey to it. You can’t appreciate the good times without the bad ones.
Ionut-Cosmin Theodorescu – Computer Science BSc (With Foundation Year)
I always dreamed of studying abroad, interacting with people from different parts of the world and working together towards a common goal.
I found the Foundation Year extremely useful as it introduces you into the University study core, thanks to the teachers who have a unique passion for teaching. I felt supported all the time.
The decisive year for me was the 2nd year for I was to interact with the Careers and Employability Service as it was recommended by one of the lectures. Also, in that year I was encouraged by Careers and Employability Service to attend an Employability Unit, I opted for a Spanish Class which was held by the University of Bedfordshire. Adding another foreign language to the CV is always a big plus.
The University of Bedfordshire gave me the confidence to fulfil my dream and to secure my future.
The Careers and Employability Service did a phenomenal job at guiding and preparing me for the future interviews. With what I have learned in the past years I have managed to combine the soft skills and the knowledge that I have achieved up to now, in order to secure a Placement Year Position thanks to the University of Bedfordshire and to the teachers who have inspired me.
Next year I am looking forward to expanding my skills and to achieve even greater goals, this could not be possible without the help of the teaching team that have done a great job of pointing us with wisdom towards our goal. Thanks to them and to the University of Bedfordshire our future is secured.
Solange Yehouenou - BSc Computer Science and Software Engineering
When I decided to go back to school, I was determined but I was scared too. Being a mum had a lot to do with my fears.
I wasn't sure if I could make it all the way to the end. But here I am now, having just passed all the units of my second year and on my way to my final year.
I tell you this now, it has been an amazing experience. At first, it was overwhelming especially with the coding and all the different programming languages.
Many times, I felt panicky and left behind, but then the group assignments were launched and together with other students I started feeling like I was part of something wonderful. We shared our knowledge, research our subjects, but also shared our moments of panic and victories.
I believe that when you want it bad enough, then you realize that your wings already exist; All you have to do is FLY..
My second year was more focused because I knew what to expect. The lessons were designed as presentation slides and easy to follow; the practical sessions allowed us to ask questions and get help from our teachers. There were regular breaks every few hours and students can meet up for a cup of tea or coffee to exchange views or have a laugh etc...
I want to thank all my teachers and university staff who were always ready to guide, encourage, help and inform me whenever I needed it. Without you, it wouldn’t have been possible to get this far. God bless you all.
I am very excited at the thought of starting my final year. I know how challenging this is going to be. I am gathering ideas about potential projects that I’m going to work on and above all, I can't wait to get back to the bubbly, multicultural environment of the Bedfordshire University and see all my friends and teachers again.
Joshua Peach - FdSc Construction Management
I have really enjoyed the course so far, I have found as the course has developed my on site knowledge the two have merged into one and now I am working hand in hand with what I study on the course with what I deal with on site on a daily basis.
The course so far has given me a much wider perspective of construction as a whole, rather then just day to day site management. Something I believe can only lead me in good stead moving forward in the industry.
I am looking forward to moving on to the 'top up' and further developing knowledge on different areas of the sector. As the course will be in the fourth year I feel I am best place to balance my work and University work, work load something I have at times found hard.
Finally, I am extremely looking forward to getting stuck into my dissertation and reviewing areas of construction I feel strongly about.
Arsalan Naveed - Computer Science and Software Engineering (with Foundation Year)
I feel lucky to be part of Bedfordshire University, it's not just University but it’s a home with multicultural. I have learnt a lot in the past two years and I’m very excited for my final year.
I am very thankful for the teachers and staff who helped me a lot with everything that I needed. They are always available to support and keep me motivated towards the future by introducing not just me but everyone at University with potential employers for our future career.
Through my experience at University with projects and assignments, I would say:
Set a goal and go for it, never change the goal but be flexible with the approach.
Lionel Jayaraj - PhD Student 2020
Lionel Jayaraj joined the School of Computer Science and Technology in 2014 initially on a Post Graduate taught course, but has since achieved an MSc by Research and developed his research in the area of
Immersion in Virtual Reality for sports (a cricket game) by integrating novel tracking and performance capture techniques.
Lionel Jayaraj from the Institute for Research in Applicable Computing, within the School for Computer Science and Technology, has successfully defended his thesis by PhD Viva.
Following a detailed examination, Lionel gave a robust defence of his thesis and was recommended as a pass, subject to corrections to be completed.
Lionel's supervisory team are: Dr Jim Wood, (Directory of Studies) and Dr Marcia Gibson
Thank you for the overwhelming support, encouragement, and your precious time. I hadn't dreamt of a PhD when I entered the University in 2014 holding a B.Tech graduation. I would recommend my supervisory team to encourage and produce more PhD students and I am happy to be their first student. Their support, the University's resources, and staff's friendship have made it feel like a piece of cake.
Justyna Kurczaba - Student Computer Science BSc
My name is Justyna Kurczaba and I study Computer Science BSc at the University of Bedfordshire.
Prior to starting my journey I never had any experience in computing. Therefore I am overwhelmed with the progress I was able to make during the recent months of my education.
Learning to program felt intimidating at the beginning of the last academic year. I was not feeling confident when tutors were passing by and looking at my code. However, after a lot of practice and determination I was able to produce a satisfying piece of code. This was one of the most memorable and empowering moments of my life. It was also a milestone to my current, small success. Suddenly, I felt this indescribable motivation to become my own teacher. Weekly worksheets uploaded by course coordinators provided me with enough information to create my own independent projects. Also group projects were also incredibly beneficial to my improvement. Not only did I exchanged my knowledge and skills with other team mates but also I discovered how important communication is.
In this University you are not just a student but you will feel you are part of a big family.
Moreover, I was challenged to go out of my comfort zone and I had to seek assistance from tutors which was a bit daunting for me. However, they approached me with patience and understanding which encouraged me to further develop my skills. Even though lectures and practical sessions were held only three times a week I was able to find an abundance of supporting materials in the library which was more than sufficient while learning on my own.
I am incredibly grateful to be presented with an opportunity to study at the University of Bedfordshire where I met inspiring people who contributed to my growth.
Justyna 26, has also been rewarded for commitment to her studies with the BCS (The Chartered Institute of IT) Bedford Branch Student Prize which is given every year to the highest performing first year computing student in the University’s School of Computer Science and Technology.
Justyna had no experience of computing until she came to the University, but in her first year she excelled in her studies to become the highest performing student in her cohort achieving the highest possible grades for all subjects.
Justyna’s prize includes automatic membership of the BCS for the remainder of her studies and a £150 cash prize. Her certificate was presented by the Chair of the BCS Bedford Branch Dr Ip-Shing Fan from Cranfield University.
It is great to see such dedication and hard work, and is great that we can reward it through the kind sponsorship of BCS.

Faisal Hoque - 2nd Year Computer Science Student
After successfully passing my first year; during the summer holidays I was encouraged by a certain staff member to help fellow students who started Year 1 in February. I was reluctant at first due to my lack of confidence. However, it was a wonderful opportunity to improve this aspect of myself, so I decided to help the February students out whenever I could. This alone empowered me so much to continue improving my confidence and soft skills, that I decided to also help my fellow students who were working on referral assignments.
I was also encouraged to join the University of Bedfordshire BCS Student Chapter (also called Beds Computing SU Society) and to help run it during my Year 2 studies. I initially took the position of Vice-Chairman while a friend took the role of Chairman but after a month or so of running a few events I eventually took over the role of Chairman.
The skills I’ve learnt and opportunities I’ve gained since first joining the University in 2016, would not have been possible if it wasn’t for the extraordinary teaching staff within the CST School. My personal view from what I’ve experienced and heard from other students; a university is only as good as the students who make the most of it. There are so many opportunities and advantages available at the University of Bedfordshire, and it’s about engaging and seeking those opportunities for yourself
Dorcas Sunday - BSc Computer Security and Forensics
I must say, I am blessed to be a student at the University of Bedfordshire. In University of Bedfordshire there are lots to achieve not just studying alone. It is a home for international student (it is warm and friendly).
Any course you choose, there is an equipment to help improve your skills and knowledge.
The environment is conductive for learning, and the great facilities includes 24/7 library, gym, laboratories, etc.
There is a good online student information desk, where students can make enquires/complain and get quick response immediately. Studying here at the University of Bedfordshire gives me a better edge among my peers and great opportunity in the future (Job opportunity).
Kudos to all the staff for your massive support and teaching, you are superb and amazing. Without you, my success story is incomplete, you all deserve some accolades.

Introduction to the View Prompts feature in Microsoft Copilot
Enhancing User Experience and Educational Value with Microsoft Copilot’s new ‘View Prompts’ Feature
In the ever-evolving landscape of educational technology, tools that enhance both user experience and learning outcomes are invaluable. Microsoft Copilot, its generative artificial intelligence Chatbot has introduced a new innovative ‘View Prompts‘ feature. This feature provides transparency and new ways to customise workflows when using the tool. It improves how we interact with the tool which in turn provides significant educational benefits, particularly for academic staff.
The update offers the ability to see and tailor the very prompts that guide Copilot’s responses. This new level of insight and control can transform educators’ and academic’s engagement with the Copilot platform. By understanding the logic behind AI-generated answers to prompts, it is then possible to craft more effective prompts, leading to more precise and relevant information being generated. This feature will serve as an enhanced learning tool, helping staff (and students) develop better questioning techniques and a deeper understanding of AI capabilities.
Why do I need to read a blog on the View Prompts feature?
This blog post doesn’t have the answers to how to craft the perfect prompt post and many different frameworks have been developed by individuals (and universities) that involved different prompt engineering and design techniques. Instead, this blog post will look at how Microsoft Copilot can support and enhance the use of GenAI to efficiently provide meaningful prompt outputs.
Microsoft Copilot Functionality Update Part 2: View & Save Prompts
It was also identified that there was a problem with the embedded video in the previously released “Microsoft Copilot (GenAI Chatbot) feature update – November 2024” blog post. The embedded video can now be viewed via the HTML version of the blog post or directly here.
The following embedded video shows the new feature and its associated functionality. If viewing the blog post in email please use the attached link to view the video as the email client may automatically removed the embedded video code as a security precaution.
Link to Microsoft Copilot feature update 2 (View Prompts) video
1. Searching for a pre-written prompt
Depending upon the complexity of the prompt, the amount of planning, time and effort (and text!) can be very resource-heavy. Rather than trying to develop a new prompt from scratch, there is now the option to view a repository of pre-created prompts within Microsoft Copilot via the new ‘View Prompts’ feature. This feature can be accessed within Copilot regardless of whether you are starting a new completely new conversation or are 15 prompts into the 30 prompt limit in a conversation.
To start, simply click on the ‘View Prompts’ button towards the bottom right corner of the screen.
A new ‘Prompts from Copilot Lab’ menu will appear. This menu includes a series of the most commonly used pre-written prompts that you can immediately select and use. There is also a ‘See all prompts’ option in the bottom right.
*NOTE The pre-written prompts available on Microsoft Copilot are by design relatively basic in nature.
It is also possible to refine your prompt search via the dropdown ‘Task’ menu box.
Once a prompt has been selected, the prompt is simply transferred to the prompt input area.
2. Saving a prompt to reuse
Developing the perfect prompt for a required output can be quite an undertaking, with this in mind it makes complete sense that you may want to save the prompt for future use (I previously saved prompts in notebook files in a directory on my computer) but now with the new ‘View Prompts’ feature in Copilot, it is possible to save a prompt directly into Copilot and provide details (Category, Name and description) to make searching for and retrieving these prompts in the future easier than ever.
To save a prompt you have developed and want to re-use in the future, hover the mouse pointer over the prompt in question and a small menu will appear in the top-right corner, select the ‘Save prompt’ option.
After clicking the ‘Save Prompt’ option a new Save Prompt dialogue menu will appear.
Enter an intuitive title to give to your prompt to allow you to easily locate it in the future (Max 35 characters). Complete the process by clicking the ‘Save’ button.
To re-use a saved prompt
Open Copilot and press the ‘View Prompts’ button.
Press the ‘Saved’ button and select the required previously saved prompt.
Deleting a previously saved prompt
To delete a previously saved prompt, hover the mouse icon over the blue ribbon in the bottom corner of the saved prompt and click to remove. Be aware that once the ribbon is clicked, no warning message appears and the prompt is immediately and permanently deleted.
In this example screenshot, only one previously created prompt has been saved and therefore is available.
How the View Prompts feature increases educational value
The ‘View prompts‘ feature significantly enhances user experience and increases the educational value of prompt design/engineering in several ways:
- Personalisation: Staff can customise and reuse prompts to better fit their specific needs and preferences. This leads to more relevant and satisfying interactions, as the AI can be tailored to respond in ways that are most useful to the user.
- Educational Value: Viewing the prompts will help staff learn how to ask better questions and understand the AI’s capabilities and limitations. This will make their interactions more efficient and productive.
- Feedback and Improvement: The feature encourages users to provide feedback on the prompts, which can be used to refine and improve the AI’s performance over time. This creates a continuous improvement loop, enhancing the overall quality of the service.
- Enhanced Engagement: Knowing how the AI generates responses can make the interaction more engaging and interesting for staff, as they can see the logic behind the answers and feel more connected to the process.
- Understanding AI Logic: By seeing the prompts, users can learn how the AI processes information and generates responses. This insight helps users craft more effective and precise prompts, leading to better outcomes.
- Awareness of AI Capabilities: Viewing the prompts helps staff understand the strengths and limitations of the AI. This awareness can prevent unrealistic expectations and encourage users to ask questions that the AI is well-equipped to handle.
- Learning by Example: Staff can see examples of well-structured prompts, which can serve as a model for their prompt development. This can be particularly useful for those new to interacting with AI.
- Enhanced Critical Thinking: By analysing how different prompts affect the Copilots’s responses, staff (and students) can develop better critical thinking skills. They learn to evaluate the effectiveness of their questions and adjust them as needed.
- Improved Query Formulation: Staff can observe which types of prompts yield the best results. This knowledge can be applied to future interactions, making them more efficient and productive.
Conclusion
The ‘View prompts‘ feature in Copilot is a powerful tool that enhances user experience by providing transparency, personalisation, and educational value. By allowing staff and students to see and customise the prompts, Copilot empowers them to have more meaningful and productive interactions.

Introduction to the View Prompts feature in Microsoft Copilot
Enhancing User Experience and Educational Value with Microsoft Copilot’s new ‘View Prompts’ Feature
In the ever-evolving landscape of educational technology, tools that enhance both user experience and learning outcomes are invaluable. Microsoft Copilot, its generative artificial intelligence Chatbot has introduced a new innovative ‘View Prompts‘ feature. This feature provides transparency and new ways to customise workflows when using the tool. It improves how we interact with the tool which in turn provides significant educational benefits, particularly for academic staff.
The update offers the ability to see and tailor the very prompts that guide Copilot’s responses. This new level of insight and control can transform educators’ and academic’s engagement with the Copilot platform. By understanding the logic behind AI-generated answers to prompts, it is then possible to craft more effective prompts, leading to more precise and relevant information being generated. This feature will serve as an enhanced learning tool, helping staff (and students) develop better questioning techniques and a deeper understanding of AI capabilities.
Why do I need to read a blog on the View Prompts feature?
This blog post doesn’t have the answers to how to craft the perfect prompt post and many different frameworks have been developed by individuals (and universities) that involved different prompt engineering and design techniques. Instead, this blog post will look at how Microsoft Copilot can support and enhance the use of GenAI to efficiently provide meaningful prompt outputs.
Microsoft Copilot Functionality Update Part 2: View & Save Prompts
It was also identified that there was a problem with the embedded video in the previously released “Microsoft Copilot (GenAI Chatbot) feature update – November 2024” blog post. The embedded video can now be viewed via the HTML version of the blog post or directly here.
The following embedded video shows the new feature and its associated functionality. If viewing the blog post in email please use the attached link to view the video as the email client may automatically removed the embedded video code as a security precaution.

1. Searching for a pre-written prompt
Depending upon the complexity of the prompt, the amount of planning, time and effort (and text!) can be very resource-heavy. Rather than trying to develop a new prompt from scratch, there is now the option to view a repository of pre-created prompts within Microsoft Copilot via the new ‘View Prompts’ feature. This feature can be accessed within Copilot regardless of whether you are starting a new completely new conversation or are 15 prompts into the 30 prompt limit in a conversation.
To start, simply click on the ‘View Prompts’ button towards the bottom right corner of the screen.
A new ‘Prompts from Copilot Lab’ menu will appear. This menu includes a series of the most commonly used pre-written prompts that you can immediately select and use. There is also a ‘See all prompts’ option in the bottom right.
*NOTE The pre-written prompts available on Microsoft Copilot are by design relatively basic in nature.
It is also possible to refine your prompt search via the dropdown ‘Task’ menu box.
Once a prompt has been selected, the prompt is simply transferred to the prompt input area.
2. Saving a prompt to reuse
Developing the perfect prompt for a required output can be quite an undertaking, with this in mind it makes complete sense that you may want to save the prompt for future use (I previously saved prompts in notebook files in a directory on my computer) but now with the new ‘View Prompts’ feature in Copilot, it is possible to save a prompt directly into Copilot and provide details (Category, Name and description) to make searching for and retrieving these prompts in the future easier than ever.
To save a prompt you have developed and want to re-use in the future, hover the mouse pointer over the prompt in question and a small menu will appear in the top-right corner, select the ‘Save prompt’ option.
After clicking the ‘Save Prompt’ option a new Save Prompt dialogue menu will appear.
Enter an intuitive title to give to your prompt to allow you to easily locate it in the future (Max 35 characters). Complete the process by clicking the ‘Save’ button.
To re-use a saved prompt
Open Copilot and press the ‘View Prompts’ button.
Press the ‘Saved’ button and select the required previously saved prompt.
Deleting a previously saved prompt
To delete a previously saved prompt, hover the mouse icon over the blue ribbon in the bottom corner of the saved prompt and click to remove. Be aware that once the ribbon is clicked, no warning message appears and the prompt is immediately and permanently deleted.
In this example screenshot, only one previously created prompt has been saved and therefore is available.
How the View Prompts feature increases educational value
The ‘View prompts‘ feature significantly enhances user experience and increases the educational value of prompt design/engineering in several ways:
- Personalisation: Staff can customise and reuse prompts to better fit their specific needs and preferences. This leads to more relevant and satisfying interactions, as the AI can be tailored to respond in ways that are most useful to the user.
- Educational Value: Viewing the prompts will help staff learn how to ask better questions and understand the AI’s capabilities and limitations. This will make their interactions more efficient and productive.
- Feedback and Improvement: The feature encourages users to provide feedback on the prompts, which can be used to refine and improve the AI’s performance over time. This creates a continuous improvement loop, enhancing the overall quality of the service.
- Enhanced Engagement: Knowing how the AI generates responses can make the interaction more engaging and interesting for staff, as they can see the logic behind the answers and feel more connected to the process.
- Understanding AI Logic: By seeing the prompts, users can learn how the AI processes information and generates responses. This insight helps users craft more effective and precise prompts, leading to better outcomes.
- Awareness of AI Capabilities: Viewing the prompts helps staff understand the strengths and limitations of the AI. This awareness can prevent unrealistic expectations and encourage users to ask questions that the AI is well-equipped to handle.
- Learning by Example: Staff can see examples of well-structured prompts, which can serve as a model for their prompt development. This can be particularly useful for those new to interacting with AI.
- Enhanced Critical Thinking: By analysing how different prompts affect the Copilots’s responses, staff (and students) can develop better critical thinking skills. They learn to evaluate the effectiveness of their questions and adjust them as needed.
- Improved Query Formulation: Staff can observe which types of prompts yield the best results. This knowledge can be applied to future interactions, making them more efficient and productive.
Conclusion
The ‘View prompts‘ feature in Copilot is a powerful tool that enhances user experience by providing transparency, personalisation, and educational value. By allowing staff and students to see and customise the prompts, Copilot empowers them to have more meaningful and productive interactions.
This feature, along with other capabilities like real-time assistance, contextual understanding, and task automation, makes Copilot an invaluable learning companion.

Amidst the vibrant tech community, the summit gathered speakers for the keynote from some of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence. The keynote speakers included Dr Matt Wood, VP of AI at AWS, Chris Whyde, SVP, Engineering & Data Science at Lonely Planet, and Ken Lovell, Senior Vice President of Golf Technology at PGA TOUR. The speakers offered profound insights into the latest advancements in generative AI and their transformative potential across various industries.
The keynotes were a highlight for Dr Maryam, with speakers showcasing the newest advancements in generative AI models. The speakers demonstrated how these models have become more efficient, accurate, and applicable across diverse fields. The ability of generative AI to produce more natural and contextually relevant content was particularly fascinating, highlighting its growing importance in both creative and technical domains.
However, it wasn’t just the technological advancements that caught Dr Maryam’s attention; the emphasis on AI ethics and responsibility also struck a chord with her. The rapid emergence of generative artificial intelligence poses significant challenges, particularly in the education sector, affecting academic integrity. Whereas generative AI can also take form in ‘deepfakes’, created using machine learning and AI, manipulate accessible images, facial data, and audio clips to produce fake but realistic videos or images. With the ability to convincingly impersonate anyone, cybercriminals are becoming smarter and can orchestrate scams with precision, while also fostering a sense of confusion, scepticism, and the spread of misinformation. Dr Maryam stated, “There was a significant emphasis on the ethical considerations surrounding generative AI. The keynotes discussed the importance of developing AI responsibly, ensuring that models are transparent, unbiased, and secure. This resonated deeply, especially considering the risks associated with deepfakes and other malicious uses of AI in recent years.”
Dr Maryam was also impressed by the new integrations and enhancements unveiled by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for their AI and machine learning services, such as Amazon SageMaker. The machine-learning application helps data scientists and machine learning engineers build foundation models from scratch, evaluate and customise foundation models with advanced techniques. These updates promised to simplify the deployment and scaling of generative AI models, making it easier for businesses to adopt AI solutions without requiring extensive technical expertise.
Real-world applications of these technologies were illustrated through various case studies from companies such as, Ferrari, DoorDash, Smartsheet, Adobe, and PGA Tour. The case studies showcased how companies are leveraging generative AI to innovate in content creation, customer service, and user experience. With the rise of generative AI, companies are now leveraging software such as generative art tools such as Midjourney, and large language models such as ChatGPT to help generate ideas, create boundless copy, and experiment with different strategies. These programmes are only getting more sophisticated with GPT-4o offering multimodal reasoning and generating integrating text, voice and vision into a single model, as well as advanced capabilities in language and audio processing. Dr Maryam cited, “These examples demonstrated the tangible benefits such as streamlining processes and personalising experiences for users, while capitalising on ROI that generative AI can bring to various sectors”.
A standout experience for Dr Maryam was a hands-on session titled, ‘Building and Deploying Scalable Machine Learning Models’. This session was particularly impactful due to its interactive nature. Dr Maryam engaged in building a machine learning model from scratch and gained practical experiences with AWS tools like Amazon SageMaker and AWS Lambda. This practical experience allowed attendees like Dr Maryam to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world context.
The sessions were also enriched by the presence of industry experts who provided in-depth insights and personalised feedback which would help attendees understand the complex concepts and troubleshoot issues effectively. The collaborative environment fostered during this session was invaluable, enabling attendees to share ideas and learn from each other's experiences, thereby building professional connections and gaining diverse perspectives on AI challenges and solutions.
Another significant part of the summit for Dr Maryam was leading the Women in Cyber Security roundtable. Despite the growing cyber security workforce, according to the Women in Cybersecurity: Women in the Profession report published by ISC2 in April 2024, found that the percentage of women in the industry is likely in the range of 20% to 25%. The report underscores the persistent gender disparity within the field and highlights the importance of targeted initiatives to support and retain women in cyber security roles. This session profoundly influenced her perspective on creating diverse opportunities within the cyber security field. Dr Maryam remarked, “At the conference, I heard first-hand accounts from women in cyber security highlighting the specific challenges faced, such as gender bias, lack of mentorship, and limited access to professional development opportunities. This awareness is crucial for addressing these barriers effectively.”
By listening to first-hand accounts from women in cyber security, Dr Maryam gained a deeper understanding of the specific challenges faced in the sector, such as gender bias, lack of mentorship, and limited access to professional development opportunities. The discussions underscored the importance of mentorship programmes and support networks in empowering women and fostering their career growth. Dr Maryam reflected, “The roundtable reinforced my commitment to promoting inclusivity and diversity within the cyber security industry, by advocating for policies and initiatives that support underrepresented groups, together we can create a more equitable and innovative industry”.
The insights gained from the recent AWS Summit are poised to drive digital transformation on Staffordshire University London's computing courses. Dr Maryam plans to incorporate the latest advancements in generative AI and AWS technologies into the curriculum, ensuring that students are equipped with cutting-edge knowledge and skills. This includes offering specialised modules in our courses and hands-on practical’s focusing on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing. Dr Maryam’s vision is to emphasise the ethical considerations of AI development and deployment in the curriculum. Dr Mayam said, “The purpose is to prepare students to create responsible and fair AI solutions, cultivating a generation of tech professionals who prioritise societal impact and responsibility.”
Dr Maryam envisions strengthening partnerships with industry leaders like AWS to provide students with unparalleled access to industry expertise, internships, and job opportunities. By collaborating with such tech firms, the University can enhance practical learning and prepare students for successful careers.
AWS's commitment to supporting startups through programs like AWS Activate aligns perfectly with our goal of fostering a culture of innovation among students. By providing resources, credits, and mentorship, AWS empowers students to transform their ideas into thriving businesses. Additionally, AWS's comprehensive training and certification programs equip students with the in-demand cloud computing skills necessary to excel in the tech industry.

Fri 26 January, 2024A study undertaken by the University of Bedfordshire and the University of Cambridge, looking into teacher use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in language education, has revealed a growing trend among educators regularly using the technology.
Showcased in EL Gazette – a renowned news organisation for the English Language Teaching industry – the study was led by Dr Nahal Khabbazbashi from the University’s Centre for Research in English Language Learning & Assessment (CRELLA) and Dr Evelina Galaczi from the University of Cambridge.
As part of the study, the researchers surveyed more than 380 language teachers from 70 countries about their experiences using the technology and found that 51% said they are comfortable using AI and over a third (40%) use it on a weekly basis.
Amongst the most popular uses was assistance in creating lesson plans and assignment briefs, with many educators referring to AI as a ‘collaborator’. One teacher from Bosnia Herzegovina also told the study that it serves as a ‘second pair of eyes when reviewing materials’.
The research also revealed a high demand for more AI training as part of professional development. This included 25% of teachers believing that they would require ongoing monthly training.
However, some teachers also expressed concerns about the use of this technology and associated risks of plagiarism, misinformation, and unequal access to technology.
Following on from this research, academics at CRELLA are set to undertake a new project examining the use of AI among students from the so-called ‘Generation Z’ – those born between 1996 and 2010.
Speaking about this research, Dr Khabbazbashi said: “It is an exciting time to be working on research related to Generative AI in language education and I am so pleased that this joint study has received media attention. I am also delighted that our team has received additional funding to work on a follow-up research, this time examining Generation Z student experiences with AI, which should have important implications for our own students at the University of Bedfordshire. So watch this space!”

Mariia Tishenina et al, EHU – Walking together: weaving the tapestry of PGR community, research culture, and collective journey through the grass-roots collaborative Walk’n’Talk initiative
Mariia Tishenina, Chiara Colombo, Jessica Eccles-Padwick, Amelia Ernest, Matthew Greenhalgh, Tu Nguyen, Keisha Ann Stewart, Carrie-Anne Sturt, Delta Wright
Embarking on a journey through doctoral education is undoubtedly a fulfilling endeavour. However, such opportunity also bequests circumstances occasionally fraught with issues which potentially affect an individual’s health and mental wellbeing; as recognised by the Office for Students’ Catalyst fund – £1.5m investment in a programme aimed at supporting postgrads by enhancing the provision of targeted support services and activities, delivered across 17 higher education institutions.
Here at Edge Hill University, we (a group of Postgraduate Researchers, predominantly Graduate Teaching Assistants) have begun to explore this, from the ground up. By stepping out onto such ground – and the surrounding campus, blessed in nature – we are discovering a variety of benefits to sharing open discussion as we Walk ‘n’ Talk. Escaping the office and isolated working, we are curious to understand the psychological impact of open vs closed environments and the activity of walking as a medium which establishes rhythm, pace, and energy to our conversations, as well as our daily lives.
As part of this symposium, we will continue to consider how these ‘mini journeys’ are enhancing not only our overall experiences, but also developing our research, researcher identities, and a shared purposeful community. We will further unpick the sociological and psychological aspects of our joint venture, deliberate some physiological benefits, and philosophically enquire how we, as fellow travellers, occasionally align along parallel trajectories to overcome concerns around imposter syndrome and potentially interweave with others to develop our tapestry; a support net(work) and research culture which captures the ‘fabric’ of EHU.

Paul Lees and Nic Davis-Crane, Liverpool John Moores University – An exploration of the perception and utility of artificial intelligence within Liverpool Business School
Abstract
All presenters work extensively with degree apprenticeship learners within Liverpool Business School (LBS). The strong alignment between classroom-based learning and application within the workplace has encouraged reflection on the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) beyond academic boundaries. Whilst we acknowledge that higher education must be mindful of promoting correct usage, our research focusses upon three themes:
• How AI is used in an academic setting to support and promote learning.
• How apprentices currently use AI within their organisations and potential for future enhancement.
• How academic staff currently use AI and potential for future enhancement.
Our presentation will outline the results from a survey sent out to all current undergraduate and post graduate apprentices within LBS and compare and contrast this with the responses received from a survey sent out to academic staff who are currently engaged with apprenticeship learners.
Sturgess (2023) argues that business schools have a dual responsibility related to engagement. Firstly, to listen to the needs of the client, which in this case are the requirements of our learners and their organisations, and secondly to shape that demand through knowledge creation and dissemination.
Within LBS we view our academic staff, apprenticeship mentors, professional services staff, and learners as a community of practice. Our research and subsequent findings will enhance our delivery which in turn delivers an excellent learner experience. Alongside this, we will engage in meaningful knowledge exchange; listening to learner needs, developing capacity, and tailoring delivery to meet current and future demands.

John Brindle, EHU & Lancaster University – Do you feel safe? Creating digital safe spaces in higher education as a third space professional
Abstract
The creation of safe spaces in higher education is a contentious topic that has been both praised and criticised in the national press and academic literature. This empirical paper explores the concept of safe spaces from the position of third space professionals in higher education and acts as a pilot study in preparation for further thesis-study. Utilising critical digital pedagogy as a frame, Third Space Professionals were interviewed about their approach to, and thoughts on, creating safe spaces in the digital domain. This paper contributes the exploration of third space professionals’ thoughts and approaches to digital safe spaces concluding that the third space has much to contribute to this field, including experiences relating to scaffolding, back-channel usage, and critical approaches to digital safe space creation.

Rachel Wilcock, EHU – Co-designing student employability-focused knowledge exchange in education, mental health, and sport
Abstract
This study explores the co-design of a student employability-focused knowledge exchange opportunity linked to the sport- and art-based mental health literacy and education programme, Tackling the Blues (TtB).
TtB is a university-community collaboration between Edge Hill University, Everton in the Community and Tate Liverpool. Using the participatory action research (PAR) approach to explore employability and graduate outcome priorities for students, 38 Tackling the Blues student mentors from Edge Hill University engaged in workshops during the 2022-23 academic year. The data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis and generated two themes: 1) conceptualising employability, and 2) creating meaningful employability-related opportunities.
The findings provide insight into how participatory methods can be used to gain experiential knowledge of students’ lives to enhance employability and employment outcomes. Also highlighted are students’ perspectives on what employability means to them, and what they want to achieve from employability-related activity. The paper concludes by considering how data generated through participatory methods were used to shape the role of the Tackling the Blues student mentor with a particular focus on equality, diversity and inclusion, and wider higher education employability pedagogy and curriculum.

Dr Naomi Hodgson, EHU – Educational research, adisciplinarity, and the study of constitution
Abstract
In response to considerable critique of its rigour and relevance, the field of educational research has sought to prove its validity, both in terms of its scientific legitimacy and its relevance to policy and practice. One result of this seems to have been a heightened concern with methodology, to the extent that a form of methodolatry developed. In conjunction with wider changes in the governance of research, from disciplinary to thematic foci, educational research seems also prone to adisciplinarity. Critiques from philosophy of education of the privileging of gold standard methodologies point to the empiricism that characterises the field and overlooks questions of value and meaning. It is arguably not the empiricism as such that is problematic but its unmooring from the theoretical and the educational. The possibility of an anthropologically informed educational philosophy is explored as a way out of the impasse.
Dr Damien Shortt, EHU – Like a drunk at a dinner party: populist contributions to education policy-making
Abstract
Populist politicians and movements are sometimes seen as bringing to the surface of public debate those topics and issues of difference that, in the interests of maintaining a polite society, many would rather not acknowledge or discuss. In so doing, they force a society to confront the potentially divisive values and beliefs that a sometimes surprisingly large proportion of citizens hold.
This paper will survey and reflect upon the ways in which many different flavours of populism from around the world have influenced national education debates and policy-making.
I will conclude by considering the generally applicable lessons that can be learned from specific examples, and then reflecting upon the dilemmas facing education researchers in the face of populist politics.
Clara Kassam, Dr Sana Rizvi, Liverpool John Moores University – “I remember having a meeting and thinking this isn’t an education decision, it’s a business decision”: Narratives of academics delivering meaningful inclusion and disability courses amidst marketisation pressures
Abstract
Higher Education in the last four decades has been shaped by increasing marketisation and commodification of courses (Erickson et al, 2020). Courses once associated with critical thinking, individual learning, and societal progress are now impacted by performance metrics which determine the closure of courses and departments. Increasing managerialism has left academics feeling stuck in a cycle of constant change, becoming “shoe-fitters” (p.2143). Humanities, arts and social sciences appear to experience greater micromanagement that includes influencing the teaching of critical subjects such as inclusion and disability, often determining not only what is taught but also the value assigned (Haggis, 2006).
For this presentation, we report on the findings from a small-scale, qualitative study that utilised semi-structured interviews with 17 academics teaching across undergraduate and postgraduate courses in ‘red-brick’ and post-92 universities. The research aimed to explore academic narratives on how the changing educational and political landscape in the UK has shaped teaching and scholarship in inclusion and disability studies. We used thematic analysis to develop themes. We focus on one aspect of the findings which relates to how performance metrics and a business-model of the disability and inclusion discipline impacts academics’ professional identities and magnifies their vulnerabilities. Participants felt teaching on any inclusion or disability-related course was reduced to a numbers game, where ‘generic’ teaching was encouraged, critical content was slowly removed, and many iterations of the course were in place to maximise profits. Our presentation concludes on the future possibilities of teaching and scholarship of inclusion and disability studies.

Dr Karen Boardman, EHU – Is there a problem with forward facing pushchairs? Exploring the perceptions of parents, carers, families, and professionals in Early Years
Abstract
The varied and increasing debates surrounding communication, language and literacy development for babies and young children are already well established within policy (DfE 2023), literature (DfE 2023; Early Years Coalition 2021) and research (Boardman, 2024; Lally 2012; Larson and Marsh 2005; Smith and Vincent 2022).
The recent Covid pandemic has also heightened this renewed focus for policy makers. The suggestions offered to support families usually involve a catch-up or intervention solution delivered in nursery or schools. I suggest that we need to consider the whole context of very young children’s experiences and support parents, carers and families with every aspect of communication, language and literacy (CLL) development from birth, including the way we use our pushchairs.
The findings of a contemporary research study (Boardman 2023, 2024) exploring ways to support rising fives with their communication, language and literacy development unearthed an interesting trend highlighting that there may be a systematic problem with the way that we use our pushchairs. The study highlights that most families reposition their pushchairs from parent facing to forward facing from the ages of 6 months to 9 months. This study, whilst building on the work of Zeedyk and the National Literacy Trust in 2018 presents some new knowledge linked to the dilemma with forward facing pushchairs and supporting CLL development.
The research study suggest that we need to support families and early years professionals with some important decisions about pushchairs and how this may impact on children’s communication and language experiences from birth – as is their right as a child (UNCRC). In order to enable the critical two-way back and forth communication and the interactions necessary for babies and young children to develop their language, babies need to look at and see familiar faces all the time. If we turn our pushchairs to forward facing between 6 and 9 months old, this opportunity is completely lost. We know from a plethora of research studies, which include 1001 days Manifesto, 2024, that babies and young children need to be making eye contact, using facial gestures, pointing, noticing details, babbling and developing their communication from birth.
It is really difficult to talk to children if we cannot see them!

Jonathan Bursnall, EHU – Can £1455 per pupil per year compensate for the effects of austerity and decades of neo-liberal education policy?
Abstract
Superficially, the Pupil Premium Grant (PPG) is the epitome of a socially just education policy. £2.9bn in 2023 alone to support around 2.2 million pupils (Roberts 2023) this funding is given directly to schools and ring-fenced for them to spend as they see fit, with the sole objective of closing the disadvantaged attainment gap. However, if we look a little closer; at the design, implementation and evaluation of the policy and at the wider education and social policy landscape into which the PPG was launched in 2011 then, its social justice credentials look far less secure.
Framed within a definition of social justice proposed by Nandy (2012) this conceptual study seeks to position the PPG at the intersection of two critical policy arenas: austerity and the neo-liberal education agenda. It explores how the eligibility and accountability of the PPG collided with an education sector ‘based on the principles of market exchange and competition’ (Ball 2021:2). This policy intervention occurred when per pupil spending was cut by between 8% and 11% (Martindale 2022 & Smith 2019) and whilst the government was trying to fix the blame for the fiscal crisis on its predecessor (Wolf 2014 cited in Smith 2019). This left schools struggling to bridge the gap between education and society, something that as long ago as 1970, Bernstein had concluded they could not possibly do.

Nathan Workman, University of Bath – Fairness and Equity in International Education: An Analysis of the Predictors of Barriers to Entry in International Education
Abstract
For those who can access international opportunities, global tertiary education offers a wealth of potential practical and personal benefits. However, access to these opportunities remains highly constrained by significant financial, informational, cultural, and familial barriers, rendering many potential international students unable to fulfill their desires. Based on a large-scale study (n=476) of potential Chinese international students, this paper analyzes the predictive relationship between a student’s socioeconomic background and the challenges they perceive in studying abroad. The results showcase how the economic level of prospective migrants’ towns and peer groups has a greater predictive effect on the motivation to study abroad than individual family financial status. They also indicate that while there is a significant link between the perception of difficulties in embarking on educational migration and the financial resources of a student’s parents, the same is not true for their parents’ education level. The results suggest that educational administrations and researchers need to pay greater attention if international education is to be a force for greater global equity instead of a tool for entrenching existing inequalities.

Session F – Workshop
Dr Susie Marriott, EHU – Introducing colour to help neuro-diverse students in reading complex academic texts
Abstract
The abstract introduces a simple yet effective approach to reading and analysing academic papers and other documents for neuro-divergent students new to researching in higher education. While there is much in the literature about students completing their academic writing with support from books and videos, showing them how to successfully achieve this, there is little published research which outlines or helps students in reading, analysing or understanding academic resources and how to use them effectively. This can be particularly problematic for new students, particularly those who are neuro-diverse, with learning differences such as dyslexia. The discussion shows how a multi-sensory approach to the reading process helps dyslexic students by highlighting, consolidating, and organising information through colour-coding, responding to visual learning preferences. The multi-sensory method of visual cues to enhance the black and white text found in academic journal articles uses a colour pallet and coding system to help sequence information. This process of highlighting words, sentences, figures, and information of significance helps neuro-diverse students to navigate longer or more complicated texts and helps them to recognise patterns within their reading. This promotes a deeper understanding from their reading which can be seen in the quality of their written work. The process of using colour as an integral part of the reading process has proved particularly useful to students completing their first literature review. This has helped build confidence in their academic reading and developing clearer written work using academic sources.

Session A – Symposium
Mariia Tishenina et al, EHU – Walking together: weaving the tapestry of PGR community, research culture, and collective journey through the grass-roots collaborative Walk’n’Talk initiative
Mariia Tishenina, Chiara Colombo, Jessica Eccles-Padwick, Amelia Ernest, Matthew Greenhalgh, Tu Nguyen, Keisha Ann Stewart, Carrie-Anne Sturt, Delta Wright
Embarking on a journey through doctoral education is undoubtedly a fulfilling endeavour. However, such opportunity also bequests circumstances occasionally fraught with issues which potentially affect an individual’s health and mental wellbeing; as recognised by the Office for Students’ Catalyst fund – £1.5m investment in a programme aimed at supporting postgrads by enhancing the provision of targeted support services and activities, delivered across 17 higher education institutions.
Here at Edge Hill University, we (a group of Postgraduate Researchers, predominantly Graduate Teaching Assistants) have begun to explore this, from the ground up. By stepping out onto such ground – and the surrounding campus, blessed in nature – we are discovering a variety of benefits to sharing open discussion as we Walk ‘n’ Talk. Escaping the office and isolated working, we are curious to understand the psychological impact of open vs closed environments and the activity of walking as a medium which establishes rhythm, pace, and energy to our conversations, as well as our daily lives.
As part of this symposium, we will continue to consider how these ‘mini journeys’ are enhancing not only our overall experiences, but also developing our research, researcher identities, and a shared purposeful community. We will further unpick the sociological and psychological aspects of our joint venture, deliberate some physiological benefits, and philosophically enquire how we, as fellow travellers, occasionally align along parallel trajectories to overcome concerns around imposter syndrome and potentially interweave with others to develop our tapestry; a support net(work) and research culture which captures the ‘fabric’ of EHU.

Paul Lees and Nic Davis-Crane, Liverpool John Moores University – An exploration of the perception and utility of artificial intelligence within Liverpool Business School
Abstract
All presenters work extensively with degree apprenticeship learners within Liverpool Business School (LBS). The strong alignment between classroom-based learning and application within the workplace has encouraged reflection on the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) beyond academic boundaries. Whilst we acknowledge that higher education must be mindful of promoting correct usage, our research focusses upon three themes:
• How AI is used in an academic setting to support and promote learning.
• How apprentices currently use AI within their organisations and potential for future enhancement.
• How academic staff currently use AI and potential for future enhancement.
Our presentation will outline the results from a survey sent out to all current undergraduate and post graduate apprentices within LBS and compare and contrast this with the responses received from a survey sent out to academic staff who are currently engaged with apprenticeship learners.
Sturgess (2023) argues that business schools have a dual responsibility related to engagement. Firstly, to listen to the needs of the client, which in this case are the requirements of our learners and their organisations, and secondly to shape that demand through knowledge creation and dissemination.
Within LBS we view our academic staff, apprenticeship mentors, professional services staff, and learners as a community of practice. Our research and subsequent findings will enhance our delivery which in turn delivers an excellent learner experience. Alongside this, we will engage in meaningful knowledge exchange; listening to learner needs, developing capacity, and tailoring delivery to meet current and future demands.

John Brindle, EHU & Lancaster University – Do you feel safe? Creating digital safe spaces in higher education as a third space professional
Abstract
The creation of safe spaces in higher education is a contentious topic that has been both praised and criticised in the national press and academic literature. This empirical paper explores the concept of safe spaces from the position of third space professionals in higher education and acts as a pilot study in preparation for further thesis-study. Utilising critical digital pedagogy as a frame, Third Space Professionals were interviewed about their approach to, and thoughts on, creating safe spaces in the digital domain. This paper contributes the exploration of third space professionals’ thoughts and approaches to digital safe spaces concluding that the third space has much to contribute to this field, including experiences relating to scaffolding, back-channel usage, and critical approaches to digital safe space creation.

In this interactive session, Natalie talks about her journey of bringing Mindfulness sessions and the Mindfulness-Based-Stress-Reduction programme to staff and students at Edge Hill University, and this has developed into doctoral research project. Natalie trained as a Mindfulness-Based-Stress-Reduction teacher just after the Covid-19 Pandemic and now delivers Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Mindfulness sessions to students and staff, alongside her role as a Senior Lecturer in Education.
This session will include a series of guided mindfulness practices (ranging from 3-15mins) and opportunities to reflect and discuss applying this with students. Natalie shares the grassroots approach she has taken to establish a culture of Mindfulness. Starting from scratch, hear Natalie talk about the strategies and approaches she has used to embed Mindfulness and MBSR into everyday university life. Included in the talk will be an overview of Natalie’s doctoral research to date and the way she believes Mindfulness and MBSR can support the mental health and wellbeing of those in the teaching profession.
Session F – Workshop
Dr Susie Marriott, EHU – Introducing colour to help neuro-diverse students in reading complex academic texts
Abstract
The abstract introduces a simple yet effective approach to reading and analysing academic papers and other documents for neuro-divergent students new to researching in higher education. While there is much in the literature about students completing their academic writing with support from books and videos, showing them how to successfully achieve this, there is little published research which outlines or helps students in reading, analysing or understanding academic resources and how to use them effectively. This can be particularly problematic for new students, particularly those who are neuro-diverse, with learning differences such as dyslexia. The discussion shows how a multi-sensory approach to the reading process helps dyslexic students by highlighting, consolidating, and organising information through colour-coding, responding to visual learning preferences. The multi-sensory method of visual cues to enhance the black and white text found in academic journal articles uses a colour pallet and coding system to help sequence information. This process of highlighting words, sentences, figures, and information of significance helps neuro-diverse students to navigate longer or more complicated texts and helps them to recognise patterns within their reading. This promotes a deeper understanding from their reading which can be seen in the quality of their written work. The process of using colour as an integral part of the reading process has proved particularly useful to students completing their first literature review. This has helped build confidence in their academic reading and developing clearer written work using academic sources.

First, let’s set out what AI chatbots like GPT4 and Bard are. Each chatbot is a form of artificial intelligence known as a “large language model” (LLM). You can view it as supercharged predictive text. Given a series of words, it predicts what word is most likely to come next. To do this, AIs are “trained” from a huge collection of text data sources such as internet books, websites, blogs, etc. to capture as much human language as possible. In the case of ChatGPT3.5 and GPT4, the training only includes text up to 2021, so it doesn’t have any knowledge or information from after this date. Think about all the books and papers you’ve ever read, and conversations you’ve had – these influence how you think and what you’re going to say to someone in a conversation. In human terms, if you know someone well enough, you can probably predict what they will say next. This is what the AI is doing when you interact with it. After asking theLLMa question (or prompt),theyuse their training to predictwhichwords to respond withbased on all the words it has seen before.Duringan exchange,the AIcan recallwhat’s been saidearlierinthat specificchatand can use that information to guide the next prediction,making the interactions feel like a conversation.BydefaultLLMsdon’t“remember”the exchanged detailsbetween one conversation and the next;once trained, the modelsdon’t directlyupdate or learn from theirinteractions.Once the session ends, that information is no longer available to theLLM.

From Microsoft Office to the Amazon platform, AI underpins most of the software and technology that we use in everyday life.
We are continuously seeing advancements in AI – tech companies have invested heavily in exploring its capabilities; businesses are increasingly adopting AI-based systems and processes; and people eagerly await the next ‘big thing’.
As educators, we encourage our students and staff to experiment and innovate, our very purpose is to prepare graduates for the future world of work, so shouldn’t we be leading by example?
To date, much of the university sector discourse around AI has been focussed on the threats it poses, particularly relating to assessment; how can we monitor this? How can our current systems cope with it? And so, regrettably, most universities’ initial response was to incorporate AI into academic misconduct regulations, whereby, using it would be met with severe penalties.
Yet, this does not reflect the lived reality of people outside of the academic bubble, nor the natural curiosity of our students and staff and their freedom to explore – traits we claim to encourage. With AI so firmly integrated across many of our lives and developing at an extraordinary pace, wouldn’t we be failing in our duty as educators if we were to reject it out of hand?
At Teesside University, we believe that if we are to deliver education which is truly future facing, we need to be at the forefront of the discovery stage of new technologies, leveraging AI to enhance learning, teaching and, ultimately, the workplace.
The AI debate presents an opportunity to rebalance the focus of the learning journey. At Teesside, we have reviewed our learning processes, moving away from a single end-point assessment and towards a model that celebrates the learning journey, with assessment taking place in real-time as a dialogue.
We are making our assessments more relevant to skillsets which students will need in the workplace, like communication, teamwork, resilience and innovation.
The clinic system championed at Teesside University is a fantastic example of how we embed these skills within the curriculum. Whilst generative AI may be able to draft a complex legal contract, it is never going to be able to support or console a worried client. The Teesside Law Clinic, however, teaches students how to do just that, by offering them the opportunity to work with real people on live cases.
The benefits of this project-based assessment approach are twofold. Not only does it provide students with vital real-world skills, but it is also very difficult for an AI to replicate. For example, how will a computer program be able to understand the individual needs of a local business as effectively as a student who has worked directly with the individuals involved.
At Teesside University, we believe that if we are to deliver education which is truly future facing, we need to be at the forefront of the discovery stage of new technologies, leveraging AI to enhance learning, teaching and, ultimately, the workplace.
Alongside a robust assessment system, we need to understand how AI is going to impact the workplace once our students graduate and develop our curricula accordingly.
While AI is unlikely to result in the wholesale loss of jobs, there is little doubt that it will impact tasks that people might ordinarily do in the workplace. If we continue to teach those tasks in the same way we always have, we are not necessarily equipping our students with the skills that they will need in the future.
A prime example of this is coding. For many years coding has been a central tenet of education policy, with children being taught it from primary school age. Now AI technology means a lot of coding tasks can be done by simply typing in a command. While coding is still a vital skill, we need to understand how it will be applied with the advent of AI.
The complexity of AI means a one-size-fits-all approach is not the solution, and AI’s impact must be understood at a local level. This is true of all sectors and industries, not just education. At Teesside we are in the process of developing an AI policy. However, we fully expect this to be nuanced and implemented in different ways depending on the subject or sector. We must understand the tasks that AI can carry out in our business that people can’t, and where it can, or cannot, add value to what we do.
I have always been extremely positive about embracing technology where it can enhance learning and teaching, however we must also recognise its limitations and in some cases, threats, and ethical implications. We need to be aware of these less positive aspects and develop ethical frameworks in which to operate.
While it may be appropriate to use AI in developing a computer program or performing complex calculations, is it ethical to use in a subject such as photography? And, if so, how do we educate people to tell the difference between an AI generated image and one taken in life. If indeed it is possible. These are the questions we need to be asking and developing solutions and answers.
Whatever the organisation, an AI strategy needs to start with people and supporting them to understand the technology and its capabilities. It can seem complex and inaccessible but managed correctly it represents a real opportunity to significantly enhance the future of education and business.",1182,19.7,Teesside University,19.4,13.1,14085,1182,tees.ac.uk,19.6,314:24,,81.0,United Kingdom,"news, media, policy",4.352548618037808,0.4779735682819383,912,False,1182,"Understanding the impact of AI in education | Media centre | Teesside University

The AI debate presents an opportunity to rebalance the focus of the learning journey. At Teesside, we have reviewed our learning processes, moving away from a single end-point assessment and towards a model that celebrates the learning journey, with assessment taking place in real-time as a dialogue.
We are making our assessments more relevant to skillsets which students will need in the workplace, like communication, teamwork, resilience and innovation.
The clinic system championed at Teesside University is a fantastic example of how we embed these skills within the curriculum. Whilst generative AI may be able to draft a complex legal contract, it is never going to be able to support or console a worried client. The Teesside Law Clinic, however, teaches students how to do just that, by offering them the opportunity to work with real people on live cases.
The benefits of this project-based assessment approach are twofold. Not only does it provide students with vital real-world skills, but it is also very difficult for an AI to replicate. For example, how will a computer program be able to understand the individual needs of a local business as effectively as a student who has worked directly with the individuals involved.
At Teesside University, we believe that if we are to deliver education which is truly future facing, we need to be at the forefront of the discovery stage of new technologies, leveraging AI to enhance learning, teaching and, ultimately, the workplace.
Alongside a robust assessment system, we need to understand how AI is going to impact the workplace once our students graduate and develop our curricula accordingly.
While AI is unlikely to result in the wholesale loss of jobs, there is little doubt that it will impact tasks that people might ordinarily do in the workplace. If we continue to teach those tasks in the same way we always have, we are not necessarily equipping our students with the skills that they will need in the future.
A prime example of this is coding. For many years coding has been a central tenet of education policy, with children being taught it from primary school age. Now AI technology means a lot of coding tasks can be done by simply typing in a command. While coding is still a vital skill, we need to understand how it will be applied with the advent of AI.
The complexity of AI means a one-size-fits-all approach is not the solution, and AI’s impact must be understood at a local level. This is true of all sectors and industries, not just education. At Teesside we are in the process of developing an AI policy. However, we fully expect this to be nuanced and implemented in different ways depending on the subject or sector. We must understand the tasks that AI can carry out in our business that people can’t, and where it can, or cannot, add value to what we do.
I have always been extremely positive about embracing technology where it can enhance learning and teaching, however we must also recognise its limitations and in some cases, threats, and ethical implications. We need to be aware of these less positive aspects and develop ethical frameworks in which to operate.
While it may be appropriate to use AI in developing a computer program or performing complex calculations, is it ethical to use in a subject such as photography? And, if so, how do we educate people to tell the difference between an AI generated image and one taken in life. If indeed it is possible. These are the questions we need to be asking and developing solutions and answers.
Whatever the organisation, an AI strategy needs to start with people and supporting them to understand the technology and its capabilities. It can seem complex and inaccessible but managed correctly it represents a real opportunity to significantly enhance the future of education and business.",923,0.12175991,3.7442594,1

I enrolled in the LLM Transitional Justice and Conflict course in Sept 2020. I am happy with the quality of instructors I have come across in this programme. Instead of traditional test assessment, we were required to write essays and case studies and/or projects to be submitted at the end of the semester. I particularly enjoyed writing about issues and topics that were interesting to me. The instructors gave me helpful feedback during the semester. I had the opportunity to serve as a course rep and also to volunteer for the Centre of Human Rights in Conflict podcast. I feel prepared to enter the academic and professional world of transitional justice and conflict.’’

Ten more songs to make it through to the Grand Final on Saturday, with three more ‘Big 6’ performances. Interestingly this year, all ‘Big 6’ countries are singing in their native language. I’m sure this doesn’t happen very often? I’m a big fan of music not in the English language, so let’s take a look and listen…
01 Australia Milkshake Man – Go-Jo
We open (surprise surprise, Cilla) with an up-tempo song. No doubt it’s a catchy pop song, but OMG (and maybe this is me showing my age), I can do without the innuendo. Yes, the ESC needs levity, giddiness and some songs that are essentially novelty. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. How the heck Windows95man made it through to the GF last year for Finland, but it did! And then tanked in the Grand Final. Let’s file Australia’s song in a similar category – thinks it’s funny with all the innuendos about a man and his milk. I’m just not here for it – it all feels a bit juvenile. Or maybe I’m just grumpy! That said, this up-tempo pop song will get us going and let’s see if it gets to the GF…
02 Montenegro Dobrodosli – Nina Žižić
Aah, the familiar moody Eastern European vibes from Montenegro. Orchestral opening with breathless vocals, it all progresses quite nicely – except it really doesn’t go anywhere. It’s almost the instrumental as chorus, and before we know it the last 25 seconds feels like it’s going to crescendo, and then it doesn’t quite. Second in the draw, will it be early doors for Montenegro? Let’s see what the staging and performance can do…
03 Ireland Laika Party – EMMY
OK then, get your head around this. Ireland have sent a song to the ESC about Laika, a Soviet dog who was launched into space back in 1957 (3 November to keep the historians happy!). Awr. Stray dog goes to space – let’s write a song about that, right? Nope, let’s sugar coat the fact that she perished in space and hope that Laika is still alive, kids. I love the bonkers-ness of the lyrics, and I like the preposterous hope that she’s still alive! That said, this is an earworm of a bop, and I like it a lot. Again, retro vibes, but also easily singalong-able. I’m also quite fond of EMMY’s Aqua-esque vocals.
I have shared with you the Late Late Show recording of the song, as filmed in the Old Library in Trinity College Dublin. My dear friend and Eurovision bestie Dr (Dame) Brian Singleton (mentioned on the blog every year) is made up that he’s finally got to see Trinity College embrace the Eurovision. Brian will retire as Samuel Beckett Chair of Drama and Theatre later this year, so it’s fitting for him that that this brilliant performance has been staged in the Old Library.
I hope the kids get behind it and that it gets to the GF – just don’t tell them the dog is dead – you have to put them to bed, remember…
04 Latvia Bur man laimi – Tautumeitas
I find this a joyous song with an uplifting melody and jolly harmonies. And the chugging musical underscoring keeps the tempo going (I hope you are marvelling at my highly musicological description!). Can’t wait to see how the performance is staged…
05 Armenia Survivor – Parg
Will this be the curse of the song title for Armenia? Maybe not, as they’ve qualified for the past three years. It’s our first song in this semi-final with chanting in it. Probably that’s the saving grace for it? Must admit, I got a bit bored… does anyone need their drinks/snacks refreshing at this point?
06 Austria Wasted Love – JJ
And now for one of the biggies this year. This song has been tucked in behind Sweden in the betting odds for a while now. On first listen I wasn’t sold on it, but it a Eurovision grower, I’d say. A few listens in and I got it. I also get that it’s more than adjacent to The Code from last year. Surely a song that overlaps with the song that won last year can’t win this year? There are also flourishes on the chorus from Duncan Lawrence’s winning song Arcade for The Netherland in 2019. Lather, rinse, repeat, right? 😀
What we have here is a song very much in the ‘popera’ stylings we see from time to time @ the ESC. Remember Malena Ernman with La Voix for Sweden in 2009, Cezar’s It’s My Life for Romania in 2013, and Kate Miller-Heidke’s Zero Gravity for Australia in 2019. All mixing the pop with the opera vocals.
JJ’s countertenor vocal gymnastics are impressive. And this song goes to show that you can’t judge a song by the first two minutes and fifteen seconds, because the last thirty seconds is going to blow your mind (literally!). Can’t wait to see how it’s interpreted on stage…
**
‘Big 6’ time, UK styleeee…
United Kingdom What the Hell Just Happened? – Remember Monday
I know I am generalising here, but don’t we – every year – have a downer on our entry? Some years maybe with good reason, and with the receipts to prove why after the contest.
The first time I heard this song I just thought that the composers had used generative AI to put it together. You know “write a song that sounds like Sabrina Carpenter, Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, please”. I wasn’t impressed. Also, I thought we’d got over selecting failed talent show participants to be our entry? So, I was like ‘meh’ to it all.
Cut to me listening to all the songs over the last fortnight, and the curiosity of the bonkers structure of the song took hold. Structurally, it’s mad. But hey, mad can be good, right?
Shades of Billy Joel’s My Life on the melody on the verse (which bit you ask!). It’s there if you know that song. Also, shades of Sam Ryder with the rock vibe on the chorus. Overall, not so much of a hot mess as I first thought. The girls can deffo sing, and performance will be key. Currently sitting at 11th in the betting odds. Their interview with Graham Norton was really good – and they come across as a nice girl group (it’s on iPlayer if you missed it).
I have figured out that it reminds me of Girls Aloud’s Biology. Now * that * is a bonkers song, but it’s brilliant…
When all is said at done at the weekend, will it be Remember Monday, or forgotten by Tuesday? Time will tell…
**
07 Greece Asteromata – Klavdia
This is Greece’s musical Ronseal. They are staying in their lane – reassuringly so – and are doing pretty much what they say on the tin most years. They have sent this song to the ESC in previous versions, but I’m not mad at that as I’m glad to be transported to Greece metaphorically once a year…
08 Lithuania Tavo akys – Katarsis
Gosh, there’s not much rock in the Contest this year, so this will come as a welcome change of pace. Nothing else sounds like it, and with the grunge stylings it will have an audience…
09 Malta Serving – Miriana Conte
Australia might be able to get away with a song with milk innuendos. Malta’s song as performed at the national final didn’t make it to the ESC. At the national final, Miriana’s song was called Kant. No giggling at the back, let’s be grown up about this. The word kant in Maltese means singing. Fine, what’s wrong with that? Well, erm, you be the judge…
Yeah, the milk man is one thing, but to those unfamiliar with the Maltese language, people will not think Miriana is serving singing. So yes, it’s equally as juvenile as the Australian song, and probably as clever as it is imprudent. I gotta say though, in that version (I downloaded it months ago) it’s an infectious bop.
So, Kant got canned. The fans have other plans in the arena, apparently, but bless them – the EBU will overlay the audio so we don’t get served Kant at home. Deffo going through. I’m sure the pre-Eurovision version gets more plays and downloads. In the meantime on stage Miriana is simply Serving… with a whole load of body positivivy…
10 Georgia Freedom – Mariam Shengelia
Another switcheroo of a song, with a change of tempo between verse and chorus, and also a language change at the midway point. This song is giving emotional vocals, choral vibes, and unlike Montenegro, this actually builds to a crescendo on the chorus. I like it. Let’s see how it’s staged…
**
France maman – Louane
The next of the ‘Big 6’ is a lovely chanson song by chanteuse Louane. Fabulous vocals and one of the best ballads (the best?), I’d say. France’s entry last year sung by Slimane, Mon Amour, was a special moment. If this is staged as it should be, it could be another top ten, maybe even top five finish. I have to say that the ‘Big 6’ have all pulled it out of the bag this year. Maybe they should all sing in a native language every year! 😀
11 Denmark Hallucination – Sissal
We’re back in the generic pop banger zone. Snacks and nibbles may be calling. It’s pretty much underscored with what sounds like Loreen’s Tattoo. As RuPaul’s Drag Gace UK alumnus Tace would say…
Does someone need to call a lawyer? 😀
12 Czechia Kiss Kiss Goodbye – ADONXS
I think this is the best entry from Czechia in * years *. I hope it’s staged as dramatically as the song sounds. It’s in the top ten of the betting odds, so peeps must be liking what they see ands hear. Although it’s another song that is adjacent to The Code…
13 Luxembourg La Poupée Monte Le Son – Laura Thorn
Luxemboug return with some Poupée as they did when they won in 1965 with Poupée De Cire, Poupée De Son, sung by France Gall. Like her, Laura is serving energetic, youthful vibes in a frothy pop number…
Any excuse for a Eurovision classic (written by Serge Gainsbourg)…
Btw, when it won it was seen as the modernising of the ESC, after years of swooning, crooning, chanteuse-ing and generally music for mums and dads.
14 Israel New Day Will Rise – Yuval Raphael
One of the best ballads in the Contest this year. Seemingly in denial of the geopolitics playing out beyond the Eurovision bubble, a song with saccharin lyrics like this I can’t get on board with…
**
‘Big 6’ time again…
Germany Baller – Abor & Tynna
We’re back in the pop Tardis with more retro vibes. Techno vibes, pulsating rhythms and more fiddling. Love it (yes, I’m a pop boy!). Germany tends to occupy the bottom five fairly regularly, so I hope an army of people of a certain age lift it higher than that.
15 Serbia Mila – Princ
(I want to add an E to his name!)
As with the Greek entry, this is reassuringly Serbian. I know my bestie Rachel will be all over this. Coming towards the end of SF2, and pretty much standing out from any other male vocalist in this anthemic oeuvre, I hope Princ without and E gets through…
16 Finland Ich komme – Erika Vikman
And finally, the last song of this semi-final. Or as the Finns would say, Ja lopuksi semifinaalin viimeinen kappale. I know, right!
As we started this semi-final with some (in my view) juvenile shenanigans from Australia, there’s similar to follow from Finland. It feels like, post Käärijä, this is Finland’s tactic – seemingly provocative and risqué with a bit of a banger of a song, which it is. At the national final (which she won by a landslide), Erika straddled a canon whilst singing Ich komme. Classy.
Finland have been asked by the EBU to tone down the suggestive nature of the performance. Let’s see how that shakes down. The song will bring down the house, I’m sure. Sailing through to the final…
So, my fave five songs from this semi are…
Austria
Ireland
Germany
Latvia
Malta
How about you? Where will your votes go?
Enjoy the second semi-final tonight. I’ll be back tomoz with my take on all the action. ‘Citing!
Toodles,

I find this a joyous song with an uplifting melody and jolly harmonies. And the chugging musical underscoring keeps the tempo going (I hope you are marvelling at my highly musicological description!). Can’t wait to see how the performance is staged…
05 Armenia Survivor – Parg
Will this be the curse of the song title for Armenia? Maybe not, as they’ve qualified for the past three years. It’s our first song in this semi-final with chanting in it. Probably that’s the saving grace for it? Must admit, I got a bit bored… does anyone need their drinks/snacks refreshing at this point?
06 Austria Wasted Love – JJ
And now for one of the biggies this year. This song has been tucked in behind Sweden in the betting odds for a while now. On first listen I wasn’t sold on it, but it a Eurovision grower, I’d say. A few listens in and I got it. I also get that it’s more than adjacent to The Code from last year. Surely a song that overlaps with the song that won last year can’t win this year? There are also flourishes on the chorus from Duncan Lawrence’s winning song Arcade for The Netherland in 2019. Lather, rinse, repeat, right? 😀
What we have here is a song very much in the ‘popera’ stylings we see from time to time @ the ESC. Remember Malena Ernman with La Voix for Sweden in 2009, Cezar’s It’s My Life for Romania in 2013, and Kate Miller-Heidke’s Zero Gravity for Australia in 2019. All mixing the pop with the opera vocals.
JJ’s countertenor vocal gymnastics are impressive. And this song goes to show that you can’t judge a song by the first two minutes and fifteen seconds, because the last thirty seconds is going to blow your mind (literally!). Can’t wait to see how it’s interpreted on stage…
**
‘Big 6’ time, UK styleeee…
United Kingdom What the Hell Just Happened? – Remember Monday
I know I am generalising here, but don’t we – every year – have a downer on our entry? Some years maybe with good reason, and with the receipts to prove why after the contest.
The first time I heard this song I just thought that the composers had used generative AI to put it together. You know “write a song that sounds like Sabrina Carpenter, Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, please”. I wasn’t impressed. Also, I thought we’d got over selecting failed talent show participants to be our entry? So, I was like ‘meh’ to it all.
Cut to me listening to all the songs over the last fortnight, and the curiosity of the bonkers structure of the song took hold. Structurally, it’s mad. But hey, mad can be good, right?
Shades of Billy Joel’s My Life on the melody on the verse (which bit you ask!). It’s there if you know that song. Also, shades of Sam Ryder with the rock vibe on the chorus. Overall, not so much of a hot mess as I first thought. The girls can deffo sing, and performance will be key. Currently sitting at 11th in the betting odds. Their interview with Graham Norton was really good – and they come across as a nice girl group (it’s on iPlayer if you missed it).
I have figured out that it reminds me of Girls Aloud’s Biology. Now * that * is a bonkers song, but it’s brilliant…
When all is said at done at the weekend, will it be Remember Monday, or forgotten by Tuesday? Time will tell…
**
07 Greece Asteromata – Klavdia
This is Greece’s musical Ronseal. They are staying in their lane – reassuringly so – and are doing pretty much what they say on the tin most years. They have sent this song to the ESC in previous versions, but I’m not mad at that as I’m glad to be transported to Greece metaphorically once a year…
08 Lithuania Tavo akys – Katarsis
Gosh, there’s not much rock in the Contest this year, so this will come as a welcome change of pace. Nothing else sounds like it, and with the grunge stylings it will have an audience…
09 Malta Serving – Miriana Conte
Australia might be able to get away with a song with milk innuendos. Malta’s song as performed at the national final didn’t make it to the ESC. At the national final, Miriana’s song was called Kant. No giggling at the back, let’s be grown up about this. The word kant in Maltese means singing. Fine, what’s wrong with that? Well, erm, you be the judge…
Yeah, the milk man is one thing, but to those unfamiliar with the Maltese language, people will not think Miriana is serving singing. So yes, it’s equally as juvenile as the Australian song, and probably as clever as it is imprudent. I gotta say though, in that version (I downloaded it months ago) it’s an infectious bop.
So, Kant got canned. The fans have other plans in the arena, apparently, but bless them – the EBU will overlay the audio so we don’t get served Kant at home. Deffo going through. I’m sure the pre-Eurovision version gets more plays and downloads. In the meantime on stage Miriana is simply Serving… with a whole load of body positivivy…
10 Georgia Freedom – Mariam Shengelia
Another switcheroo of a song, with a change of tempo between verse and chorus, and also a language change at the midway point. This song is giving emotional vocals, choral vibes, and unlike Montenegro, this actually builds to a crescendo on the chorus. I like it. Let’s see how it’s staged…
**
France maman – Louane
The next of the ‘Big 6’ is a lovely chanson song by chanteuse Louane. Fabulous vocals and one of the best ballads (the best?), I’d say. France’s entry last year sung by Slimane, Mon Amour, was a special moment. If this is staged as it should be, it could be another top ten, maybe even top five finish. I have to say that the ‘Big 6’ have all pulled it out of the bag this year. Maybe they should all sing in a native language every year! 😀
11 Denmark Hallucination – Sissal
We’re back in the generic pop banger zone. Snacks and nibbles may be calling. It’s pretty much underscored with what sounds like Loreen’s Tattoo. As RuPaul’s Drag Gace UK alumnus Tace would say…
Does someone need to call a lawyer? 😀
12 Czechia Kiss Kiss Goodbye – ADONXS
I think this is the best entry from Czechia in * years *. I hope it’s staged as dramatically as the song sounds. It’s in the top ten of the betting odds, so peeps must be liking what they see ands hear. Although it’s another song that is adjacent to The Code…
13 Luxembourg La Poupée Monte Le Son – Laura Thorn
Luxemboug return with some Poupée as they did when they won in 1965 with Poupée De Cire, Poupée De Son, sung by France Gall. Like her, Laura is serving energetic, youthful vibes in a frothy pop number…
Any excuse for a Eurovision classic (written by Serge Gainsbourg)…
Btw, when it won it was seen as the modernising of the ESC, after years of swooning, crooning, chanteuse-ing and generally music for mums and dads.
14 Israel New Day Will Rise – Yuval Raphael
One of the best ballads in the Contest this year. Seemingly in denial of the geopolitics playing out beyond the Eurovision bubble, a song with saccharin lyrics like this I can’t get on board with…
**
‘Big 6’ time again…
Germany Baller – Abor & Tynna
We’re back in the pop Tardis with more retro vibes. Techno vibes, pulsating rhythms and more fiddling. Love it (yes, I’m a pop boy!). Germany tends to occupy the bottom five fairly regularly, so I hope an army of people of a certain age lift it higher than that.
15 Serbia Mila – Princ
(I want to add an E to his name!)
As with the Greek entry, this is reassuringly Serbian. I know my bestie Rachel will be all over this. Coming towards the end of SF2, and pretty much standing out from any other male vocalist in this anthemic oeuvre, I hope Princ without and E gets through…
16 Finland Ich komme – Erika Vikman
And finally, the last song of this semi-final. Or as the Finns would say, Ja lopuksi semifinaalin viimeinen kappale. I know, right!
As we started this semi-final with some (in my view) juvenile shenanigans from Australia, there’s similar to follow from Finland. It feels like, post Käärijä, this is Finland’s tactic – seemingly provocative and risqué with a bit of a banger of a song, which it is. At the national final (which she won by a landslide), Erika straddled a canon whilst singing Ich komme. Classy.
Finland have been asked by the EBU to tone down the suggestive nature of the performance. Let’s see how that shakes down. The song will bring down the house, I’m sure. Sailing through to the final…
So, my fave five songs from this semi are…
Austria
Ireland
Germany
Latvia
Malta
How about you? Where will your votes go?
Enjoy the second semi-final tonight. I’ll be back tomoz with my take on all the action. ‘Citing!
Toodles,
😀

Currently serving as the Vice-President of the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, Lord Justice Holroyde lived in the Ormskirk area for 40 years and was proud to be recognised by the University.
Speaking to graduands during their graduation ceremony, Lord Justice Holroyde said:
“Lancashire is home for me and it’s a real source of pride to me to become an honorary doctor of Edge Hill University, my local university. The University has provided opportunities for everyone, including those for whom going to university may not always have seemed the obvious course. To those of you who’ve done all that while maintaining a job or a family or both, I take my hat off to you.”
Lord Justice Holroyde has had an extensive legal career spanning several decades. Educated at Oxford, he qualified as a barrister in 1977 and spent nearly 30 years practising law in Liverpool and on the Northern Circuit.
He was appointed Queen’s Counsel in 1996, during which time he prosecuted and defended in numerous high-profile criminal cases.
He was leading counsel for the prosecution in the trial relating to the deaths of more than 20 Chinese cockle pickers caught by the incoming tide and drowned in Morecambe Bay in 2004.
As a judge of the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Holroyde has heard the appeals of those prosecuted and convicted based on evidence arising from the Post Office Horizon scandal.
His work on the Sentencing Council, for which he ultimately served as Chairman, has been instrumental in shaping sentencing guidelines across England and Wales.
Lord Justice Holroyde received the honorary doctorate during a ceremony attended by staff, students and their supporters celebrating the achievements of hundreds of Edge Hill graduates. Afterwards, students met with Lord Justice Holroyde for a Q&A and tour of campus facilities.
Abbie Worden, LLB Law graduate, said:
“With everything that Tim’s done and everything that he’s achieved in his life, to be able to actually be part of such a big moment for him was really special. For us to collect our degrees at the same time that he was awarded his honorary doctorate, and then to have the opportunity to speak with him, was an honour.”
Vice-Chancellor Dr John Cater said:
“We are delighted to honour Lord Justice Holroyde in this way. His distinguished career and unwavering commitment to justice have had a profound impact on the legal profession. Moreover, his strong ties to our community make this recognition even more special.”
Edge Hill’s Academic Board awards honorary degrees in recognition of the highest levels of personal achievement in academic, professional or public life.
The other 2024 recipients are:
- Chris Kirkland, former professional goalkeeper, a Liverpool FC player and winner of an England cap;
- Dame Louise Ellman, former Leader of Lancashire County Council and former Member of Parliament for Liverpool Riverside;

Here we are then on the ESC Grand Final day. It’s been a quick week, hasn’t it.
I didn’t post after the second semi-final as I was, to be frank, a bit bored by the end of the shenanigans on Thursday night. Some surprises once again in terms of who got through. I mean, Denmark? I was a bit sad that Ireland didn’t make it through, but then the staging let it down a little.
Where to start with Australia?! Oh my days, the milkshake man was certainly delivering. It was a bit filthy, wasn’t it. Shame about the song! C’ya Australia…
So here we are on the GF day, with a full line-up of 26 songs. As always, the EBU have scheduled songs in a running order that will give us light and shade. And they have popped some songs in the draw which will effectively kill them off.
(Source: EBU)
Once again, we have a run of songs opening proceedings with up-tempo pop vibes (Norway, Luxembourg, Estonia). Then we get Israel out of the way early doors. UK are up eight. Decent effort from the semi-final performance. It is all a bit music theatre-ey, but their harmonies are fab, and the singer in the blue dress in the middle has the best vocals. Let’s see what the hell happens… (I think we know…)
I am really enjoying the presenters this year. Hazel has been a revelation. Bonkers and brilliant in equal measure!
Will Céline Dion do what she needs to do and show up tonight? Well, she’s jetted in on her private jet, so that chances are that she will. Yay! Her just being there even if she doesn’t sing will be enough of a treat.
It’s still Sweden as favourite, and Austria in second place. I’d be happy with either winning, but as you know, I’m always team Sweden, and would be delighted if we’re back in Stockholm next year. As equally delighted if Austria win and we’ve back in Vienna.
Watch out for where the professional juries vote goes. If they back Sweden, then that’s that. If they prefer Austria, then that might well be that. All very exciting! We just have to get though three hours before the voting. The whole show is too long (as I’ve said), but hey – once a year we can make the best of it…
However you will be enjoying the ESC tonight, have a ball. To my Eurovision besties Dame Brian, Rachel, Paul, Rux, Carol, Joanna and Joe – and always fond memories of our Eurovision travels, Karen Ficker (Era Stupendo!) –lots of love and schlager shenanigans.
We will be travelling to another country to do what we’ve been doing all week. Let’s see where the journey takes us tonight…
Here we go then with the rundown for the second semi-final. Ten more songs to make it through to the Grand Final on Saturday, with three more ‘Big 6’ performances. Interestingly this year, all ‘Big 6’ countries are singing in their native language. I’m sure this doesn’t happen very often? I’m a big fan of music not in the English language, so let’s take a look and listen…
01 Australia Milkshake Man – Go-Jo
We open (surprise surprise, Cilla) with an up-tempo song. No doubt it’s a catchy pop song, but OMG (and maybe this is me showing my age), I can do without the innuendo. Yes, the ESC needs levity, giddiness and some songs that are essentially novelty. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. How the heck Windows95man made it through to the GF last year for Finland, but it did! And then tanked in the Grand Final. Let’s file Australia’s song in a similar category – thinks it’s funny with all the innuendos about a man and his milk. I’m just not here for it – it all feels a bit juvenile. Or maybe I’m just grumpy! That said, this up-tempo pop song will get us going and let’s see if it gets to the GF…
02 MontenegroDobrodosli – Nina Žižić
Aah, the familiar moody Eastern European vibes from Montenegro. Orchestral opening with breathless vocals, it all progresses quite nicely – except it really doesn’t go anywhere. It’s almost the instrumental as chorus, and before we know it the last 25 seconds feels like it’s going to crescendo, and then it doesn’t quite. Second in the draw, will it be early doors for Montenegro? Let’s see what the staging and performance can do…
03 IrelandLaika Party – EMMY
OK then, get your head around this. Ireland have sent a song to the ESC about Laika, a Soviet dog who was launched into space back in 1957 (3 November to keep the historians happy!). Awr. Stray dog goes to space – let’s write a song about that, right? Nope, let’s sugar coat the fact that she perished in space and hope that Laika is still alive, kids. I love the bonkers-ness of the lyrics, and I like the preposterous hope that she’s still alive! That said, this is an earworm of a bop, and I like it a lot. Again, retro vibes, but also easily singalong-able. I’m also quite fond of EMMY’s Aqua-esque vocals.
I have shared with you the Late Late Show recording of the song, as filmed in the Old Library in Trinity College Dublin. My dear friend and Eurovision bestie Dr (Dame) Brian Singleton (mentioned on the blog every year) is made up that he’s finally got to see Trinity College embrace the Eurovision. Brian will retire as Samuel Beckett Chair of Drama and Theatre later this year, so it’s fitting for him that that this brilliant performance has been staged in the Old Library.
I hope the kids get behind it and that it gets to the GF – just don’t tell them the dog is dead – you have to put them to bed, remember…
04 Latvia Bur man laimi – Tautumeitas
I find this a joyous song with an uplifting melody and jolly harmonies. And the chugging musical underscoring keeps the tempo going (I hope you are marvelling at my highly musicological description!). Can’t wait to see how the performance is staged…
05 Armenia Survivor – Parg
Will this be the curse of the song title for Armenia? Maybe not, as they’ve qualified for the past three years. It’s our first song in this semi-final with chanting in it. Probably that’s the saving grace for it? Must admit, I got a bit bored… does anyone need their drinks/snacks refreshing at this point?
06 AustriaWastedLove – JJ
And now for one of the biggies this year. This song has been tucked in behind Sweden in the betting odds for a while now. On first listen I wasn’t sold on it, but it a Eurovision grower, I’d say. A few listens in and I got it. I also get that it’s more than adjacent to The Code from last year. Surely a song that overlaps with the song that won last year can’t win this year? There are also flourishes on the chorus from Duncan Lawrence’s winning song Arcade for The Netherland in 2019. Lather, rinse, repeat, right? 😀
What we have here is a song very much in the ‘popera’ stylings we see from time to time @ the ESC. Remember Malena Ernman with La Voix for Sweden in 2009, Cezar’s It’s My Life for Romania in 2013, and Kate Miller-Heidke’s Zero Gravity for Australia in 2019. All mixing the pop with the opera vocals.
JJ’s countertenor vocal gymnastics are impressive. And this song goes to show that you can’t judge a song by the first two minutes and fifteen seconds, because the last thirty seconds is going to blow your mind (literally!). Can’t wait to see how it’s interpreted on stage…
**
‘Big 6’ time, UK styleeee…
United KingdomWhat the Hell Just Happened? – Remember Monday
I know I am generalising here, but don’t we – every year – have a downer on our entry? Some years maybe with good reason, and with the receipts to prove why after the contest.
The first time I heard this song I just thought that the composers had used generative AI to put it together. You know “write a song that sounds like Sabrina Carpenter, Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, please”. I wasn’t impressed. Also, I thought we’d got over selecting failed talent show participants to be our entry? So, I was like ‘meh’ to it all.
Cut to me listening to all the songs over the last fortnight, and the curiosity of the bonkers structure of the song took hold. Structurally, it’s mad. But hey, mad can be good, right?
Shades of Billy Joel’s My Life on the melody on the verse (which bit you ask!). It’s there if you know that song. Also, shades of Sam Ryder with the rock vibe on the chorus. Overall, not so much of a hot mess as I first thought. The girls can deffo sing, and performance will be key. Currently sitting at 11th in the betting odds. Their interview with Graham Norton was really good – and they come across as a nice girl group (it’s on iPlayer if you missed it).
I have figured out that it reminds me of Girls Aloud’s Biology. Now * that * is a bonkers song, but it’s brilliant…
When all is said at done at the weekend, will it be Remember Monday, or forgotten by Tuesday? Time will tell…
**
07 GreeceAsteromata – Klavdia
This is Greece’s musical Ronseal. They are staying in their lane – reassuringly so – and are doing pretty much what they say on the tin most years. They have sent this song to the ESC in previous versions, but I’m not mad at that as I’m glad to be transported to Greece metaphorically once a year…
08 Lithuania Tavo akys – Katarsis
Gosh, there’s not much rock in the Contest this year, so this will come as a welcome change of pace. Nothing else sounds like it, and with the grunge stylings it will have an audience…
09 MaltaServing – Miriana Conte
Australia might be able to get away with a song with milk innuendos. Malta’s song as performed at the national final didn’t make it to the ESC. At the national final, Miriana’s song was called Kant. No giggling at the back, let’s be grown up about this. The word kant in Maltese means singing. Fine, what’s wrong with that? Well, erm, you be the judge…
Yeah, the milk man is one thing, but to those unfamiliar with the Maltese language, people will not think Miriana is serving singing. So yes, it’s equally as juvenile as the Australian song, and probably as clever as it is imprudent. I gotta say though, in that version (I downloaded it months ago) it’s an infectious bop.
So, Kant got canned. The fans have other plans in the arena, apparently, but bless them – the EBU will overlay the audio so we don’t get served Kant at home. Deffo going through. I’m sure the pre-Eurovision version gets more plays and downloads. In the meantime on stage Miriana is simply Serving… with a whole load of body positivivy…
10 GeorgiaFreedom – Mariam Shengelia
Another switcheroo of a song, with a change of tempo between verse and chorus, and also a language change at the midway point. This song is giving emotional vocals, choral vibes, and unlike Montenegro, this actually builds to a crescendo on the chorus. I like it. Let’s see how it’s staged…
**
Francemaman – Louane
The next of the ‘Big 6’ is a lovely chanson song by chanteuse Louane. Fabulous vocals and one of the best ballads (the best?), I’d say. France’s entry last year sung by Slimane, Mon Amour, was a special moment. If this is staged as it should be, it could be another top ten, maybe even top five finish. I have to say that the ‘Big 6’ have all pulled it out of the bag this year. Maybe they should all sing in a native language every year! 😀
11 DenmarkHallucination – Sissal
We’re back in the generic pop banger zone. Snacks and nibbles may be calling. It’s pretty much underscored with what sounds like Loreen’s Tattoo. As RuPaul’s Drag Gace UK alumnus Tace would say…
Does someone need to call a lawyer? 😀
12 CzechiaKiss Kiss Goodbye – ADONXS
I think this is the best entry from Czechia in * years *. I hope it’s staged as dramatically as the song sounds. It’s in the top ten of the betting odds, so peeps must be liking what they see ands hear. Although it’s another song that is adjacent to The Code…
13 Luxembourg La Poupée Monte Le Son – Laura Thorn
Luxemboug return with some Poupée as they did when they won in 1965 with Poupée De Cire, Poupée De Son, sung by France Gall. Like her, Laura is serving energetic, youthful vibes in a frothy pop number…
Any excuse for a Eurovision classic (written by Serge Gainsbourg)…
Btw, when it won it was seen as the modernising of the ESC, after years of swooning, crooning, chanteuse-ing and generally music for mums and dads.
14 IsraelNew Day Will Rise – Yuval Raphael
One of the best ballads in the Contest this year. Seemingly in denial of the geopolitics playing out beyond the Eurovision bubble, a song with saccharin lyrics like this I can’t get on board with…
**
‘Big 6’ time again…
GermanyBaller – Abor & Tynna
We’re back in the pop Tardis with more retro vibes. Techno vibes, pulsating rhythms and more fiddling. Love it (yes, I’m a pop boy!). Germany tends to occupy the bottom five fairly regularly, so I hope an army of people of a certain age lift it higher than that.
15 SerbiaMila – Princ
(I want to add an E to his name!)
As with the Greek entry, this is reassuringly Serbian. I know my bestie Rachel will be all over this. Coming towards the end of SF2, and pretty much standing out from any other male vocalist in this anthemic oeuvre, I hope Princ without and E gets through…
16 FinlandIch komme – Erika Vikman
And finally, the last song of this semi-final. Or as the Finns would say, Ja lopuksi semifinaalin viimeinen kappale. I know, right!
As we started this semi-final with some (in my view) juvenile shenanigans from Australia, there’s similar to follow from Finland. It feels like, post Käärijä, this is Finland’s tactic – seemingly provocative and risqué with a bit of a banger of a song, which it is. At the national final (which she won by a landslide), Erika straddled a canon whilst singing Ich komme. Classy.
Finland have been asked by the EBU to tone down the suggestive nature of the performance. Let’s see how that shakes down. The song will bring down the house, I’m sure. Sailing through to the final…
So, my fave five songs from this semi are…
Austria
Ireland
Germany
Latvia
Malta
How about you? Where will your votes go?
Enjoy the second semi-final tonight. I’ll be back tomoz with my take on all the action. ‘Citing!
Our Swiss hosts wasted no time in making that point, announcing the Contest as a welcome home party. I hadn’t thought of it like that, but I guess it is. I know I mentioned yesterday that there wouldn’t be much faffing at the start of the show, but there was! The duo of presenters settled into their stride as the show went on, and their script was actually very funny in places. It did make me laugh that presenter Sandra looked like a highlighter pen, with the colour of her outfit in vivid yellow.
As Rylan Clark said during his BBC commentary last night, “It’s the best time of the year”. And yes Rylan, it really is!
What a great first semi-final last night. A tough call to whittle the songs down from fifteen to ten, I’d say. Some of the faves didn’t make the cut, which goes to show the strength of the field this year. Did your faves make it to the Gand Final?
Out of my fave five, only Azerbaijan didn’t make it through. Pity, but the song will stay on my playlist as it’s still groovy for me.
Overall, most of the songs seemed to be enhanced by the staging, or it matched the songs. There were a few dubious performances. Red Seb from Belgium, well fancied by many before last night, was very poor vocally when singing in his lower register. And I love me a theme, but it really was all a bit too red. Surprised to see it go out last night, but actually with that vocal, there’s a reason why.
Clearly some of the retro vibes were not resonating with the voters last night (Belgium, Azerbaijan), but how fab was the styling and staging from Ukraine. I loved the filter on the camera and the vibe of the lead singer (and band as a whole). Their performance was delightful.
There were some songs where it really didn’t look (sound) like the singer was doing the heavy lifting, vocally. That’s the thing with backing vocals now allowed on the backing track, some of the effort can be supported by the pre-recorded vocals.
Brian and I were in tears by the end of Slovenia. I know, we’re big softies, but it was proper moving, right? As I feared, the draw probably didn’t help, and actually, despite effective staging, it really is a bit of a buzzkill lyrically in some ways.
I was disappointed with Estonia. I thought the vocal was a bit thin, and don’t get me started on the beyond Trump sized red tie. What’s that about? Rather odd staging (I really didn’t get it), but Tommy is a huge personality on social media, so no doubt that helped him through.
Spain gave us the diva vibes that we were expecting, although with shades of a Home and Bargain Beyoncé. Fun though, but she ain’t no Chanel from 2022.
Ukraine continues their run of qualifying for every ESC they have competed in. The lead singer reminds me of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK’s alum, Scarlett Harlett. 😀
Sweden nailed it, as expected.
Slightly surprised that Norway got though, but then the young chap will have his fans and audience.
Italy’s singer was very much channelling David Bowie Ziggy Stardust vibes, with the nice interplay with the guitarist – a bit like Bowie and his guitarist Mick Ronson used to do. Nice touch there.
San Marino (yay, it got through) was very much lads, lads, lads, lager, lager, lager vibes.
The Netherlands used close camera work very effectively, I thought. I like it when performances in the arena are tilted to the telly viewers. Not much fun for those in the arena, like. Switzerland took a similar approach.
As I mentioned the other day, Croatia will not scale the giddy heights of the runners-up position as they did last year. They crashed out.
I am surprised that Cyprus went out, as they were being favourably received. Maybe too much faffing on stage with the building blocks? And it just goes to show that a handsome chap cannot always guarantee success…
Céline Dion made an appearance on video tape. Hopefully that’s just a teaser and she will show up in the Grand Final? We’ll see.
And what else did we learn from the first semi-final?
The stage is massive and very versatile…
Poland have sent a young Michelle Visage lookalike…
The interval act with the presenters was a bit cringe, until Petra Mede saved the day…
Lots of male performers were clearly channelling Harry Style fashion vibes…
The cover version of Céline’s Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi was dreadful…
The split screen results of the voting worked really well (if a little confusing as a country could only be shown three times)…
Chief supervisor Martin Osterdahl has been banished from the arena and was sitting in what looked like the stationary cupboard (probably for his own good after the booing he had to endure last year)…
The hosts were highly likeable, and well done to Hazel Brugger for clearly filling time in the green room segment by freestyling and going off script – something must have been happening behind the scenes…
So, that’s my view on last night.
On Thursday morning I will post my preview of the second-semi final, so check that out ahead of the semi-final tomorrow night.
Until then, continua a goderti la settimana dell Eurovision…
Just a quick post before the first semi-final tonight at 8pm UK time.
Watch out for a change in how the results are delivered at the end of the show, to see who has made it to the Grand Final. You will remember that in the past the ten countries were read out at random, and that was that. This year there will be split screen action, three countries at a time, with one selected as a finalist. They keep repeating this with the various combinations of countries until we have the magic 10. I like it when the EBU tweak the format – it keeps us on our toes and will make for better telly. I guess when it’s split screen we can shout at the screen which county we want to get through (like we have always done!).
Do you remember when the EBU changed the sequencing of the final public vote from least votes to most votes after the professional juries? It was all a bit weird the first time they did that, but looking at old Contests now, delivering the votes the old way is quite long winded.
Let’s see what we think of this change tonight…
No change at the top of the bookies betting odds. Sweden and Austria locked-in for first and second. Belgium on the rise, France falling back, Switzerland on the rise, the UK pretty static in twelfth place. It would be nice to be on the left hand side of the leaderboard in the final. Apparently the staging is a little underwhelming? We’ll see on Thursday when the UK take part in the second semi-final.
Geopolitcs is playing out on the fringes of the Contest, you’ll know why. Let’s hope for good vibes and good times for these semi-finals and, as is usually the case, we’ll have a cracking Grand Final on Saturday.
Tonight the broadcast will be straight down to business, so not too much faffing at the start of the broadcast. I always find the bloomin’ flag ceremony at the Grand Final a bit of a chore. There were promises last year that the producers were going to cut the airtime down. It still topped out at over four hours, which is far too long.
Anyhow, we’ve got two hours and twenty minutes of Eurovision to escape to tonight.
Brian and I had out first gin and Fanta when he arrived last night (a Eurovision tradition of ours as regular readers might remember). We’ll be pouring a g ‘n’ t soon, and I’ve got some spicy Nik Naks and sour cream and chive pretzels for us to nibble on. Here are the receipts from two years ago 😀 …
Get your house in order with snacks and beverages and enjoy the evening. I will be back on Wednesday with a review of ‘what the hell just happened’ (thanks Remember Monday!).
It’s finally here! Long anticipated by many, we’re one day away from the first semi-final.
Rehearsals began in Basel on what was our bank holiday weekend in the UK. In the first week there were technical rehearsals of the staging, lighting etc., with the use of stand-ins in place of the performers – who knew! Following that it was the turn of all the semi-finalists to do their rehearsals on stage in person over recent days. All culminating before the welcome ceremony on Sunday afternoon, on the turquoise carpet no less. If you missed the action, you can catch up via the link below…
From today it’s dress rehearsals and then we’re into the live action on Tuesday night.
This year the rehearsals have been held in private. For many years the eyes and the ears of fans (and others) were all over this stage of the preparations. Some comments were helpful and insightful, some bitchy and snipey. So, in a move to contain the coverage at this sensitive time for the performers, initially the EBU (European Broadcasting Union) released a review of each rehearsal, accompanied by three pictures.
What was hilarious is that some of the fan websites were critiquing the performances based on three photographs and a write up! Oh, the desperation to have something to say! I will have plenty to say once I’ve seen the semi-final on Tuesday.
That said, if you would like to preview all the performances the EBU have now posted lots of content and rehearsal footage via the ESC socials, webpage and YouTube. When I do my recaps on Wednesday and Friday I will have the full semi-final performances in my round-up.
With that in mind, here are my thoughts on the first crop of songs – what I think based on what I’m hearing and feeling (remember, I’ve not seen any performance footage yet). As always, there’s a smorgasbord of musical styles, tilting to styles of music we are already familiar with, and some, not so much.
As I have said to you in the past, a Eurovision winner is a song you have never heard before that you already know…
We start this semi-final with two up-tempo songs…
01IcelandRóa – Væb
A bit of a bop to get us started. Brothers Hálfdán and Matthías Matthíasson are serving youthful energy and galactic silver style. Sung with gusto, interspersed with Celtic fiddles as well as chants of “Hey” to get us involved – and a key change. Even though it’s sung in Icelandic, there’s enough of a hook in terms of melody and rhythm. Good start…
02PolandGaya – Justyna Steczkowska
More fiddling with the Polish song. Confident vocals with a thumping tempo and some nice harmonies. Maintains the vibe in the opening of this semi-final. I like it (btw, I like a lot of the songs this year!)…
03SloveniaHow Much Time Do We Have Left – Klemen Slakonja
Oh gosh, early doors introspection from Slovenia! There are a few song titles this year asking the more philosophical questions of life (we’ll get to the UK later), and this is one of them. How Much Time Do We Have Left is a nice change of pace from the first two songs. I like the timbre of the vocals and the melody. The song feels like a little hug. I hope it doesn’t get forgotten in the running order, but it might. The lyrics are heartbreaking, and the storytelling of the song resonates if you listen to the song. It makes me want to have a little euro-weep. Scratch that, it makes me want to have what Oprah Winfrey calls the ‘ugly cry’. If the professional juries were voting I’d be more confident of it getting through, but they only contribute to the Grand Final. Fingers crossed, but it might be a bit of a buzz kill…
04EstoniaEspresso Macchiato – Tommy Cash
One of the early faves in the betting odds. It has drifted recently, but for me this is one of the first songs that hooked me in this year, and one of the best. There a quite a few songs this year that flip between major and minor keys, or changes of tempo and language. This is one of them. I love it. It’s a bonkers earworm. Clearly riding on Sabrina Carpenter’s fabulous Espresso from last year. Tommy sees that, and raises it to Macchiato level. I would say this is sailing through to the Grand Final. Hopefully Tommy’s signature style and luscious locks won’t be a hindrance…
**
As with last year, all of the automatic qualifiers (the ‘Big 6’) perform in the semi-finals. First up is…
Spain Esa Diva – Melody
Pretty much in the oeuvre of Spain when they go all hi-energy dance vibes on us. Singer Melody is serving us sass, with a catchy song including familiar flamenco flourishes. You can also hear a bit of Loreen’s Tattoo on Melody’s vocal stylings (Melody’s melody, if you like!). I am sure that she will be styled in some kind of gem stoned body suit with a bevvy of male backing dancers? If I was a betting man…
**
05UkraineBird of Pray – Ziferblat
A delightful groovy song (baby). Shades of Sweet Dreams My LA Ex in the guitar riffs. And for some reason I’m getting Jesus Christ Superstar in the backing vocals. The groove is a departure from what Ukraine would ordinarily send. It will do well, for reasons we would rather not have to take account of in the Eurovision bubble, but also because it’s a good pop song…
06SwedenBara Bada Bastu – KAJ
Now then. Is this the ESC2025 winner in waiting? Well, it’s been number one in Sweden for the past 11 weeks, since it won the Swedish selection process, Melodifestivalen. It’s been favourite in the bookies betting odds since before it won Melodifestivalen (remembering that odds are based on where punters are putting their money).
Interesting to note that this is the first time since 1998 that Sweden will be singing in Swedish and not English. As of 1999 participating countries could sing in any language, prior to that it was only in their domestic tongue. Singing in Swedish doesn’t seem to have diminished the songs popularity. Why? Because it’s joyous, fun, a bit giddy and an earworm of a song – something we can all sing along with even though we don’t understand Swedish (us non-Swedes!).
It goes off script from what Swedeen would usually send – perfectly crated mainstream pop. This is perfectly crafted, but with the musical stylings of dansband in the mix it feels fresh and fun. And the song is one that, once you’ve got the hook, it’s easy to sing along with.
Oh, and – what’s that you say? Why is this blog post titled Finns can only get better? Well, that’s because the group KAJ are Finnish, so the Finns are doubling-up this year. KAJ seem on for the win and deffo top three in the Grand Final. It’ll be interesting to see what the professional juries make of it. See what you think…
07 Portugal Deslocado – NAPA
Mid-tempo guitar vibes from Portugal. Nice melody, with shades of The Beatles and Elton John to my ear. If it gets to the Grand Final, I am sure it will be popular with the professional juries. The first Portuguese song to catch my ear in quite a few years…
08NorwayLighter – Kyle Alessandro
An up-tempo pop song that you have heard before. It breaks down the tempo over the bridge. It’s OK, if a bit generic. Performance will be key. I hope they tweak the national final staging, I’m guessing they won’t. Maybe one to refill the snacks and beverage to…
09BelgiumStrobe Lights – Red Sebastian
He’s not just any Sebastian, he’s Red Sebastian. 😀
This is a europop banger. Over the recent past, Belgium has a habit of sending heavily inspired retro sounding songs (think Gustaph in Liverpool in 2023 with the 90s-tastic Because of You). Red Seb is giving us techno vibes on a plate, allowing those of us of a certain age to enter the Eurovision Tardis. File this under “this sounds a bit like 2Unlimited’s ‘No Limits’”. We have at least one of these songs every year. Consistently in the top ten betting odds, sure to make the final…
**
And so to the second of the ’Big 6’…
ItalyVolevo essere un duro – Lucio Corsi
Aah, another song that is a hug in the form of a song. Very much in the oeuvre of what Italy send to the ESC, and a style with which they consistently do well.
BTW, songs representing Italy @ ESC ordinarily have a route though the San Remo Music Festival. Each year the winner is invited to represent Italy. As with other countries over the years, some performers decline the opportunity to represent their country (which happened in Germany a few years back). And so it was this year that the winner of San Remo, singer Olli, declined to take the invitation. Unsurprisingly, when offered to runner-up, Lucio Corsi, the invitation was accepted – like you would!
For me it’s adjacent to the vibe of Portugal, but I like that too. I’m sure the professional juries will lap it up. And be sure to not judge a book by its cover, right…
**
10AzerbaijanRun With U – Mamagama
Ooh yeah. We’re back in the groove again. Love it. Deffo vibes from Daft Punk’s Get Lucky, and playing with falsetto on the vocal is effective. A few years back Azerbaijan hit the ground running when they debuted at ESC2008. A run of good results – and winning ESC2011 – has tailed off in recent years. Let’s see if they can reach their first Grand Final since 2022…
11San MarinoTutta L’Italia – Gabry Ponte
Keeping the good vibes coming, this song is adjacent to Sweden’s Bara Bada Bastu, in that there’s more chanting for us to get involved with, and more ‘speaking-singing’. Accordions in the mix on this one? It’s catchy, and I’d like to see it get though. It might get cancelled out by Sweden. Good job San Marino, it’s been hit and miss in the past. More of a hit for me this year…
12AlbaniaZjerm – Shkodra Elektronike
I often like the musical stylings of Albania, so it’s no surprise that I like this song. Very much staying in their lane. I love the orchestration and the lyrical hook of ‘Aman, miserere, Aman, miserere’, and the interplay of the female and male vocalists. It’s another song overlapping with another song – Poland this time. Looking at the ESC history books, Albania get through every other year, so if that’s the case, they should get though this year…
13The NetherlandsC’est La Vie – Claude
Don’t be fooled by the balladeering at the start of the song. Forty-four seconds in it’s * boom * – a pop banger! This is so going through and a possible top five finish in the Grand Final. Deffo top ten. A brilliant year for The Netherlands, for sure…
14CroatiaPoison Cake – Marko Bošnjak
There are often highs @ ESC, followed by lows. In other words, success or relative failure. The UK had it between 2022 and 2023, for example. Sam Ryder finished in second place in 2022, followed by Mae Muller in 25th place in 2023. France finished in second place in 2021, and then 24th in 2022.

H’loo! Here we are then on the ESC Grand Final day. It’s been a quick week, hasn’t it.
I didn’t post after the second semi-final as I was, to be frank, a bit bored by the end of the shenanigans on Thursday night. Some surprises once again in terms of who got through. I mean, Denmark? I was a bit sad that Ireland didn’t make it through, but then the staging let it down a little.
Where to start with Australia?! Oh my days, the milkshake man was certainly delivering. It was a bit filthy, wasn’t it. Shame about the song! C’ya Australia…
So here we are on the GF day, with a full line-up of 26 songs. As always, the EBU have scheduled songs in a running order that will give us light and shade. And they have popped some songs in the draw which will effectively kill them off.
(Source: EBU)
Once again, we have a run of songs opening proceedings with up-tempo pop vibes (Norway, Luxembourg, Estonia). Then we get Israel out of the way early doors. UK are up eight. Decent effort from the semi-final performance. It is all a bit music theatre-ey, but their harmonies are fab, and the singer in the blue dress in the middle has the best vocals. Let’s see what the hell happens… (I think we know…)
I am really enjoying the presenters this year. Hazel has been a revelation. Bonkers and brilliant in equal measure!
Will Céline Dion do what she needs to do and show up tonight? Well, she’s jetted in on her private jet, so that chances are that she will. Yay! Her just being there even if she doesn’t sing will be enough of a treat.
It’s still Sweden as favourite, and Austria in second place. I’d be happy with either winning, but as you know, I’m always team Sweden, and would be delighted if we’re back in Stockholm next year. As equally delighted if Austria win and we’ve back in Vienna.
Watch out for where the professional juries vote goes. If they back Sweden, then that’s that. If they prefer Austria, then that might well be that. All very exciting! We just have to get though three hours before the voting. The whole show is too long (as I’ve said), but hey – once a year we can make the best of it…
However you will be enjoying the ESC tonight, have a ball. To my Eurovision besties Dame Brian, Rachel, Paul, Rux, Carol, Joanna and Joe – and always fond memories of our Eurovision travels, Karen Ficker (Era Stupendo!) –lots of love and schlager shenanigans.
We will be travelling to another country to do what we’ve been doing all week. Let’s see where the journey takes us tonight…
Here we go then with the rundown for the second semi-final. Ten more songs to make it through to the Grand Final on Saturday, with three more ‘Big 6’ performances. Interestingly this year, all ‘Big 6’ countries are singing in their native language. I’m sure this doesn’t happen very often? I’m a big fan of music not in the English language, so let’s take a look and listen…
01 Australia Milkshake Man – Go-Jo
We open (surprise surprise, Cilla) with an up-tempo song. No doubt it’s a catchy pop song, but OMG (and maybe this is me showing my age), I can do without the innuendo. Yes, the ESC needs levity, giddiness and some songs that are essentially novelty. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. How the heck Windows95man made it through to the GF last year for Finland, but it did! And then tanked in the Grand Final. Let’s file Australia’s song in a similar category – thinks it’s funny with all the innuendos about a man and his milk. I’m just not here for it – it all feels a bit juvenile. Or maybe I’m just grumpy! That said, this up-tempo pop song will get us going and let’s see if it gets to the GF…
02 MontenegroDobrodosli – Nina Žižić
Aah, the familiar moody Eastern European vibes from Montenegro. Orchestral opening with breathless vocals, it all progresses quite nicely – except it really doesn’t go anywhere. It’s almost the instrumental as chorus, and before we know it the last 25 seconds feels like it’s going to crescendo, and then it doesn’t quite. Second in the draw, will it be early doors for Montenegro? Let’s see what the staging and performance can do…
03 IrelandLaika Party – EMMY
OK then, get your head around this. Ireland have sent a song to the ESC about Laika, a Soviet dog who was launched into space back in 1957 (3 November to keep the historians happy!). Awr. Stray dog goes to space – let’s write a song about that, right? Nope, let’s sugar coat the fact that she perished in space and hope that Laika is still alive, kids. I love the bonkers-ness of the lyrics, and I like the preposterous hope that she’s still alive! That said, this is an earworm of a bop, and I like it a lot. Again, retro vibes, but also easily singalong-able. I’m also quite fond of EMMY’s Aqua-esque vocals.
I have shared with you the Late Late Show recording of the song, as filmed in the Old Library in Trinity College Dublin. My dear friend and Eurovision bestie Dr (Dame) Brian Singleton (mentioned on the blog every year) is made up that he’s finally got to see Trinity College embrace the Eurovision. Brian will retire as Samuel Beckett Chair of Drama and Theatre later this year, so it’s fitting for him that that this brilliant performance has been staged in the Old Library.
I hope the kids get behind it and that it gets to the GF – just don’t tell them the dog is dead – you have to put them to bed, remember…
04 Latvia Bur man laimi – Tautumeitas
I find this a joyous song with an uplifting melody and jolly harmonies. And the chugging musical underscoring keeps the tempo going (I hope you are marvelling at my highly musicological description!). Can’t wait to see how the performance is staged…
05 Armenia Survivor – Parg
Will this be the curse of the song title for Armenia? Maybe not, as they’ve qualified for the past three years. It’s our first song in this semi-final with chanting in it. Probably that’s the saving grace for it? Must admit, I got a bit bored… does anyone need their drinks/snacks refreshing at this point?
06 AustriaWastedLove – JJ
And now for one of the biggies this year. This song has been tucked in behind Sweden in the betting odds for a while now. On first listen I wasn’t sold on it, but it a Eurovision grower, I’d say. A few listens in and I got it. I also get that it’s more than adjacent to The Code from last year. Surely a song that overlaps with the song that won last year can’t win this year? There are also flourishes on the chorus from Duncan Lawrence’s winning song Arcade for The Netherland in 2019. Lather, rinse, repeat, right? 😀
What we have here is a song very much in the ‘popera’ stylings we see from time to time @ the ESC. Remember Malena Ernman with La Voix for Sweden in 2009, Cezar’s It’s My Life for Romania in 2013, and Kate Miller-Heidke’s Zero Gravity for Australia in 2019. All mixing the pop with the opera vocals.
JJ’s countertenor vocal gymnastics are impressive. And this song goes to show that you can’t judge a song by the first two minutes and fifteen seconds, because the last thirty seconds is going to blow your mind (literally!). Can’t wait to see how it’s interpreted on stage…
**
‘Big 6’ time, UK styleeee…
United KingdomWhat the Hell Just Happened? – Remember Monday
I know I am generalising here, but don’t we – every year – have a downer on our entry? Some years maybe with good reason, and with the receipts to prove why after the contest.
The first time I heard this song I just thought that the composers had used generative AI to put it together. You know “write a song that sounds like Sabrina Carpenter, Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, please”. I wasn’t impressed. Also, I thought we’d got over selecting failed talent show participants to be our entry? So, I was like ‘meh’ to it all.
Cut to me listening to all the songs over the last fortnight, and the curiosity of the bonkers structure of the song took hold. Structurally, it’s mad. But hey, mad can be good, right?
Shades of Billy Joel’s My Life on the melody on the verse (which bit you ask!). It’s there if you know that song. Also, shades of Sam Ryder with the rock vibe on the chorus. Overall, not so much of a hot mess as I first thought. The girls can deffo sing, and performance will be key. Currently sitting at 11th in the betting odds. Their interview with Graham Norton was really good – and they come across as a nice girl group (it’s on iPlayer if you missed it).
I have figured out that it reminds me of Girls Aloud’s Biology. Now * that * is a bonkers song, but it’s brilliant…
When all is said at done at the weekend, will it be Remember Monday, or forgotten by Tuesday? Time will tell…
**
07 GreeceAsteromata – Klavdia
This is Greece’s musical Ronseal. They are staying in their lane – reassuringly so – and are doing pretty much what they say on the tin most years. They have sent this song to the ESC in previous versions, but I’m not mad at that as I’m glad to be transported to Greece metaphorically once a year…
08 Lithuania Tavo akys – Katarsis
Gosh, there’s not much rock in the Contest this year, so this will come as a welcome change of pace. Nothing else sounds like it, and with the grunge stylings it will have an audience…
09 MaltaServing – Miriana Conte
Australia might be able to get away with a song with milk innuendos. Malta’s song as performed at the national final didn’t make it to the ESC. At the national final, Miriana’s song was called Kant. No giggling at the back, let’s be grown up about this. The word kant in Maltese means singing. Fine, what’s wrong with that? Well, erm, you be the judge…
Yeah, the milk man is one thing, but to those unfamiliar with the Maltese language, people will not think Miriana is serving singing. So yes, it’s equally as juvenile as the Australian song, and probably as clever as it is imprudent. I gotta say though, in that version (I downloaded it months ago) it’s an infectious bop.
So, Kant got canned. The fans have other plans in the arena, apparently, but bless them – the EBU will overlay the audio so we don’t get served Kant at home. Deffo going through. I’m sure the pre-Eurovision version gets more plays and downloads. In the meantime on stage Miriana is simply Serving… with a whole load of body positivivy…
10 GeorgiaFreedom – Mariam Shengelia
Another switcheroo of a song, with a change of tempo between verse and chorus, and also a language change at the midway point. This song is giving emotional vocals, choral vibes, and unlike Montenegro, this actually builds to a crescendo on the chorus. I like it. Let’s see how it’s staged…
**
Francemaman – Louane
The next of the ‘Big 6’ is a lovely chanson song by chanteuse Louane. Fabulous vocals and one of the best ballads (the best?), I’d say. France’s entry last year sung by Slimane, Mon Amour, was a special moment. If this is staged as it should be, it could be another top ten, maybe even top five finish. I have to say that the ‘Big 6’ have all pulled it out of the bag this year. Maybe they should all sing in a native language every year! 😀
11 DenmarkHallucination – Sissal
We’re back in the generic pop banger zone. Snacks and nibbles may be calling. It’s pretty much underscored with what sounds like Loreen’s Tattoo. As RuPaul’s Drag Gace UK alumnus Tace would say…
Does someone need to call a lawyer? 😀
12 CzechiaKiss Kiss Goodbye – ADONXS
I think this is the best entry from Czechia in * years *. I hope it’s staged as dramatically as the song sounds. It’s in the top ten of the betting odds, so peeps must be liking what they see ands hear. Although it’s another song that is adjacent to The Code…
13 Luxembourg La Poupée Monte Le Son – Laura Thorn
Luxemboug return with some Poupée as they did when they won in 1965 with Poupée De Cire, Poupée De Son, sung by France Gall. Like her, Laura is serving energetic, youthful vibes in a frothy pop number…
Any excuse for a Eurovision classic (written by Serge Gainsbourg)…
Btw, when it won it was seen as the modernising of the ESC, after years of swooning, crooning, chanteuse-ing and generally music for mums and dads.
14 IsraelNew Day Will Rise – Yuval Raphael
One of the best ballads in the Contest this year. Seemingly in denial of the geopolitics playing out beyond the Eurovision bubble, a song with saccharin lyrics like this I can’t get on board with…
**
‘Big 6’ time again…
GermanyBaller – Abor & Tynna
We’re back in the pop Tardis with more retro vibes. Techno vibes, pulsating rhythms and more fiddling. Love it (yes, I’m a pop boy!). Germany tends to occupy the bottom five fairly regularly, so I hope an army of people of a certain age lift it higher than that.
15 SerbiaMila – Princ
(I want to add an E to his name!)
As with the Greek entry, this is reassuringly Serbian. I know my bestie Rachel will be all over this. Coming towards the end of SF2, and pretty much standing out from any other male vocalist in this anthemic oeuvre, I hope Princ without and E gets through…
16 FinlandIch komme – Erika Vikman
And finally, the last song of this semi-final. Or as the Finns would say, Ja lopuksi semifinaalin viimeinen kappale. I know, right!
As we started this semi-final with some (in my view) juvenile shenanigans from Australia, there’s similar to follow from Finland. It feels like, post Käärijä, this is Finland’s tactic – seemingly provocative and risqué with a bit of a banger of a song, which it is. At the national final (which she won by a landslide), Erika straddled a canon whilst singing Ich komme. Classy.
Finland have been asked by the EBU to tone down the suggestive nature of the performance. Let’s see how that shakes down. The song will bring down the house, I’m sure. Sailing through to the final…
So, my fave five songs from this semi are…
Austria
Ireland
Germany
Latvia
Malta
How about you? Where will your votes go?
Enjoy the second semi-final tonight. I’ll be back tomoz with my take on all the action. ‘Citing!
Our Swiss hosts wasted no time in making that point, announcing the Contest as a welcome home party. I hadn’t thought of it like that, but I guess it is. I know I mentioned yesterday that there wouldn’t be much faffing at the start of the show, but there was! The duo of presenters settled into their stride as the show went on, and their script was actually very funny in places. It did make me laugh that presenter Sandra looked like a highlighter pen, with the colour of her outfit in vivid yellow.
As Rylan Clark said during his BBC commentary last night, “It’s the best time of the year”. And yes Rylan, it really is!
What a great first semi-final last night. A tough call to whittle the songs down from fifteen to ten, I’d say. Some of the faves didn’t make the cut, which goes to show the strength of the field this year. Did your faves make it to the Gand Final?
Out of my fave five, only Azerbaijan didn’t make it through. Pity, but the song will stay on my playlist as it’s still groovy for me.
Overall, most of the songs seemed to be enhanced by the staging, or it matched the songs. There were a few dubious performances. Red Seb from Belgium, well fancied by many before last night, was very poor vocally when singing in his lower register. And I love me a theme, but it really was all a bit too red. Surprised to see it go out last night, but actually with that vocal, there’s a reason why.
Clearly some of the retro vibes were not resonating with the voters last night (Belgium, Azerbaijan), but how fab was the styling and staging from Ukraine. I loved the filter on the camera and the vibe of the lead singer (and band as a whole). Their performance was delightful.
There were some songs where it really didn’t look (sound) like the singer was doing the heavy lifting, vocally. That’s the thing with backing vocals now allowed on the backing track, some of the effort can be supported by the pre-recorded vocals.
Brian and I were in tears by the end of Slovenia. I know, we’re big softies, but it was proper moving, right? As I feared, the draw probably didn’t help, and actually, despite effective staging, it really is a bit of a buzzkill lyrically in some ways.
I was disappointed with Estonia. I thought the vocal was a bit thin, and don’t get me started on the beyond Trump sized red tie. What’s that about? Rather odd staging (I really didn’t get it), but Tommy is a huge personality on social media, so no doubt that helped him through.
Spain gave us the diva vibes that we were expecting, although with shades of a Home and Bargain Beyoncé. Fun though, but she ain’t no Chanel from 2022.
Ukraine continues their run of qualifying for every ESC they have competed in. The lead singer reminds me of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK’s alum, Scarlett Harlett. 😀
Sweden nailed it, as expected.
Slightly surprised that Norway got though, but then the young chap will have his fans and audience.
Italy’s singer was very much channelling David Bowie Ziggy Stardust vibes, with the nice interplay with the guitarist – a bit like Bowie and his guitarist Mick Ronson used to do. Nice touch there.
San Marino (yay, it got through) was very much lads, lads, lads, lager, lager, lager vibes.
The Netherlands used close camera work very effectively, I thought. I like it when performances in the arena are tilted to the telly viewers. Not much fun for those in the arena, like. Switzerland took a similar approach.
As I mentioned the other day, Croatia will not scale the giddy heights of the runners-up position as they did last year. They crashed out.
I am surprised that Cyprus went out, as they were being favourably received. Maybe too much faffing on stage with the building blocks? And it just goes to show that a handsome chap cannot always guarantee success…
Céline Dion made an appearance on video tape. Hopefully that’s just a teaser and she will show up in the Grand Final? We’ll see.
And what else did we learn from the first semi-final?
The stage is massive and very versatile…
Poland have sent a young Michelle Visage lookalike…
The interval act with the presenters was a bit cringe, until Petra Mede saved the day…
Lots of male performers were clearly channelling Harry Style fashion vibes…
The cover version of Céline’s Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi was dreadful…
The split screen results of the voting worked really well (if a little confusing as a country could only be shown three times)…
Chief supervisor Martin Osterdahl has been banished from the arena and was sitting in what looked like the stationary cupboard (probably for his own good after the booing he had to endure last year)…
The hosts were highly likeable, and well done to Hazel Brugger for clearly filling time in the green room segment by freestyling and going off script – something must have been happening behind the scenes…
So, that’s my view on last night.
On Thursday morning I will post my preview of the second-semi final, so check that out ahead of the semi-final tomorrow night.
Until then, continua a goderti la settimana dell Eurovision…
Just a quick post before the first semi-final tonight at 8pm UK time.
Watch out for a change in how the results are delivered at the end of the show, to see who has made it to the Grand Final. You will remember that in the past the ten countries were read out at random, and that was that. This year there will be split screen action, three countries at a time, with one selected as a finalist. They keep repeating this with the various combinations of countries until we have the magic 10. I like it when the EBU tweak the format – it keeps us on our toes and will make for better telly. I guess when it’s split screen we can shout at the screen which county we want to get through (like we have always done!).
Do you remember when the EBU changed the sequencing of the final public vote from least votes to most votes after the professional juries? It was all a bit weird the first time they did that, but looking at old Contests now, delivering the votes the old way is quite long winded.
Let’s see what we think of this change tonight…
No change at the top of the bookies betting odds. Sweden and Austria locked-in for first and second. Belgium on the rise, France falling back, Switzerland on the rise, the UK pretty static in twelfth place. It would be nice to be on the left hand side of the leaderboard in the final. Apparently the staging is a little underwhelming? We’ll see on Thursday when the UK take part in the second semi-final.
Geopolitcs is playing out on the fringes of the Contest, you’ll know why. Let’s hope for good vibes and good times for these semi-finals and, as is usually the case, we’ll have a cracking Grand Final on Saturday.
Tonight the broadcast will be straight down to business, so not too much faffing at the start of the broadcast. I always find the bloomin’ flag ceremony at the Grand Final a bit of a chore. There were promises last year that the producers were going to cut the airtime down. It still topped out at over four hours, which is far too long.
Anyhow, we’ve got two hours and twenty minutes of Eurovision to escape to tonight.
Brian and I had out first gin and Fanta when he arrived last night (a Eurovision tradition of ours as regular readers might remember). We’ll be pouring a g ‘n’ t soon, and I’ve got some spicy Nik Naks and sour cream and chive pretzels for us to nibble on. Here are the receipts from two years ago 😀 …
Get your house in order with snacks and beverages and enjoy the evening. I will be back on Wednesday with a review of ‘what the hell just happened’ (thanks Remember Monday!).
It’s finally here! Long anticipated by many, we’re one day away from the first semi-final.
Rehearsals began in Basel on what was our bank holiday weekend in the UK. In the first week there were technical rehearsals of the staging, lighting etc., with the use of stand-ins in place of the performers – who knew! Following that it was the turn of all the semi-finalists to do their rehearsals on stage in person over recent days. All culminating before the welcome ceremony on Sunday afternoon, on the turquoise carpet no less. If you missed the action, you can catch up via the link below…
From today it’s dress rehearsals and then we’re into the live action on Tuesday night.
This year the rehearsals have been held in private. For many years the eyes and the ears of fans (and others) were all over this stage of the preparations. Some comments were helpful and insightful, some bitchy and snipey. So, in a move to contain the coverage at this sensitive time for the performers, initially the EBU (European Broadcasting Union) released a review of each rehearsal, accompanied by three pictures.
What was hilarious is that some of the fan websites were critiquing the performances based on three photographs and a write up! Oh, the desperation to have something to say! I will have plenty to say once I’ve seen the semi-final on Tuesday.
That said, if you would like to preview all the performances the EBU have now posted lots of content and rehearsal footage via the ESC socials, webpage and YouTube. When I do my recaps on Wednesday and Friday I will have the full semi-final performances in my round-up.
With that in mind, here are my thoughts on the first crop of songs – what I think based on what I’m hearing and feeling (remember, I’ve not seen any performance footage yet). As always, there’s a smorgasbord of musical styles, tilting to styles of music we are already familiar with, and some, not so much.
As I have said to you in the past, a Eurovision winner is a song you have never heard before that you already know…
We start this semi-final with two up-tempo songs…
01IcelandRóa – Væb
A bit of a bop to get us started. Brothers Hálfdán and Matthías Matthíasson are serving youthful energy and galactic silver style. Sung with gusto, interspersed with Celtic fiddles as well as chants of “Hey” to get us involved – and a key change. Even though it’s sung in Icelandic, there’s enough of a hook in terms of melody and rhythm. Good start…
02PolandGaya – Justyna Steczkowska
More fiddling with the Polish song. Confident vocals with a thumping tempo and some nice harmonies. Maintains the vibe in the opening of this semi-final. I like it (btw, I like a lot of the songs this year!)…
03SloveniaHow Much Time Do We Have Left – Klemen Slakonja
Oh gosh, early doors introspection from Slovenia! There are a few song titles this year asking the more philosophical questions of life (we’ll get to the UK later), and this is one of them. How Much Time Do We Have Left is a nice change of pace from the first two songs. I like the timbre of the vocals and the melody. The song feels like a little hug. I hope it doesn’t get forgotten in the running order, but it might. The lyrics are heartbreaking, and the storytelling of the song resonates if you listen to the song. It makes me want to have a little euro-weep. Scratch that, it makes me want to have what Oprah Winfrey calls the ‘ugly cry’. If the professional juries were voting I’d be more confident of it getting through, but they only contribute to the Grand Final. Fingers crossed, but it might be a bit of a buzz kill…
04EstoniaEspresso Macchiato – Tommy Cash
One of the early faves in the betting odds. It has drifted recently, but for me this is one of the first songs that hooked me in this year, and one of the best. There a quite a few songs this year that flip between major and minor keys, or changes of tempo and language. This is one of them. I love it. It’s a bonkers earworm. Clearly riding on Sabrina Carpenter’s fabulous Espresso from last year. Tommy sees that, and raises it to Macchiato level. I would say this is sailing through to the Grand Final. Hopefully Tommy’s signature style and luscious locks won’t be a hindrance…
**
As with last year, all of the automatic qualifiers (the ‘Big 6’) perform in the semi-finals. First up is…
Spain Esa Diva – Melody
Pretty much in the oeuvre of Spain when they go all hi-energy dance vibes on us. Singer Melody is serving us sass, with a catchy song including familiar flamenco flourishes. You can also hear a bit of Loreen’s Tattoo on Melody’s vocal stylings (Melody’s melody, if you like!). I am sure that she will be styled in some kind of gem stoned body suit with a bevvy of male backing dancers? If I was a betting man…
**
05UkraineBird of Pray – Ziferblat
A delightful groovy song (baby). Shades of Sweet Dreams My LA Ex in the guitar riffs. And for some reason I’m getting Jesus Christ Superstar in the backing vocals. The groove is a departure from what Ukraine would ordinarily send. It will do well, for reasons we would rather not have to take account of in the Eurovision bubble, but also because it’s a good pop song…
06SwedenBara Bada Bastu – KAJ
Now then. Is this the ESC2025 winner in waiting? Well, it’s been number one in Sweden for the past 11 weeks, since it won the Swedish selection process, Melodifestivalen. It’s been favourite in the bookies betting odds since before it won Melodifestivalen (remembering that odds are based on where punters are putting their money).
Interesting to note that this is the first time since 1998 that Sweden will be singing in Swedish and not English. As of 1999 participating countries could sing in any language, prior to that it was only in their domestic tongue. Singing in Swedish doesn’t seem to have diminished the songs popularity. Why? Because it’s joyous, fun, a bit giddy and an earworm of a song – something we can all sing along with even though we don’t understand Swedish (us non-Swedes!).
It goes off script from what Swedeen would usually send – perfectly crated mainstream pop. This is perfectly crafted, but with the musical stylings of dansband in the mix it feels fresh and fun. And the song is one that, once you’ve got the hook, it’s easy to sing along with.
Oh, and – what’s that you say? Why is this blog post titled Finns can only get better? Well, that’s because the group KAJ are Finnish, so the Finns are doubling-up this year. KAJ seem on for the win and deffo top three in the Grand Final. It’ll be interesting to see what the professional juries make of it. See what you think…
07 Portugal Deslocado – NAPA
Mid-tempo guitar vibes from Portugal. Nice melody, with shades of The Beatles and Elton John to my ear. If it gets to the Grand Final, I am sure it will be popular with the professional juries. The first Portuguese song to catch my ear in quite a few years…
08NorwayLighter – Kyle Alessandro
An up-tempo pop song that you have heard before. It breaks down the tempo over the bridge. It’s OK, if a bit generic. Performance will be key. I hope they tweak the national final staging, I’m guessing they won’t. Maybe one to refill the snacks and beverage to…
09BelgiumStrobe Lights – Red Sebastian
He’s not just any Sebastian, he’s Red Sebastian. 😀
This is a europop banger. Over the recent past, Belgium has a habit of sending heavily inspired retro sounding songs (think Gustaph in Liverpool in 2023 with the 90s-tastic Because of You). Red Seb is giving us techno vibes on a plate, allowing those of us of a certain age to enter the Eurovision Tardis. File this under “this sounds a bit like 2Unlimited’s ‘No Limits’”. We have at least one of these songs every year. Consistently in the top ten betting odds, sure to make the final…
**
And so to the second of the ’Big 6’…
ItalyVolevo essere un duro – Lucio Corsi
Aah, another song that is a hug in the form of a song. Very much in the oeuvre of what Italy send to the ESC, and a style with which they consistently do well.
BTW, songs representing Italy @ ESC ordinarily have a route though the San Remo Music Festival. Each year the winner is invited to represent Italy. As with other countries over the years, some performers decline the opportunity to represent their country (which happened in Germany a few years back). And so it was this year that the winner of San Remo, singer Olli, declined to take the invitation. Unsurprisingly, when offered to runner-up, Lucio Corsi, the invitation was accepted – like you would!
For me it’s adjacent to the vibe of Portugal, but I like that too. I’m sure the professional juries will lap it up. And be sure to not judge a book by its cover, right…
**
10AzerbaijanRun With U – Mamagama
Ooh yeah. We’re back in the groove again. Love it. Deffo vibes from Daft Punk’s Get Lucky, and playing with falsetto on the vocal is effective. A few years back Azerbaijan hit the ground running when they debuted at ESC2008. A run of good results – and winning ESC2011 – has tailed off in recent years. Let’s see if they can reach their first Grand Final since 2022…
11San MarinoTutta L’Italia – Gabry Ponte
Keeping the good vibes coming, this song is adjacent to Sweden’s Bara Bada Bastu, in that there’s more chanting for us to get involved with, and more ‘speaking-singing’. Accordions in the mix on this one? It’s catchy, and I’d like to see it get though. It might get cancelled out by Sweden. Good job San Marino, it’s been hit and miss in the past. More of a hit for me this year…
12AlbaniaZjerm – Shkodra Elektronike
I often like the musical stylings of Albania, so it’s no surprise that I like this song. Very much staying in their lane. I love the orchestration and the lyrical hook of ‘Aman, miserere, Aman, miserere’, and the interplay of the female and male vocalists. It’s another song overlapping with another song – Poland this time. Looking at the ESC history books, Albania get through every other year, so if that’s the case, they should get though this year…
13The NetherlandsC’est La Vie – Claude
Don’t be fooled by the balladeering at the start of the song. Forty-four seconds in it’s * boom * – a pop banger! This is so going through and a possible top five finish in the Grand Final. Deffo top ten. A brilliant year for The Netherlands, for sure…
14CroatiaPoison Cake – Marko Bošnjak

The University of East London (UEL) held its annual Student and Partner Celebration at the University’s Stratford Campus on 13 June 2024, showcasing the achievements of students who have prospered with the support of UEL’s industry partners.
This event reflects UEL’s Vision 2028 strategy, which has as one of its key aims the promotion of social mobility and the creation of inclusive career opportunities for students.
The Student Celebration Awards honoured students for their exceptional contributions and achievements in various categories, including Intern of the Year, Volunteer of the Year, Freelancer of the Year, Mentee of the Year, Entrepreneur of the Year, and Placement Student of the Year.
Hosting the event, Professor Paul Marshall, Pro-Vice Chancellor of Careers, Enterprise, and Talent Gateway at UEL, expressed his gratitude to the partners and students. He said,
We honour our partners who work with us on social mobility programmes, diversifying early talent pipelines, and providing career-enhancing opportunities to our students and graduates.
We also celebrate our talented students who have not only participated in our flagship programmes but have also taken proactive steps in their career development, engaging with our industry partners and serving as excellent ambassadors for the University.
Our success is built on collaboration and a shared commitment to creating inclusive, accessible, and aspirational career paths for our students. We strive to be a leading careers-focused university, transforming lives through education and driving social mobility.""
Laman Suleymanli, who’s studying for an MBA in Sustainable Energy, won Placement Student of the Year in the Student Celebration Awards. Speaking after being presented with her award by Professor Marshall, she said, “I’m so thrilled to be here. This placement was part of my MBA course, at the International Business Times, an online newspaper. My role was marketing and business development associate.
“Before coming here from Azerbaijan, I wanted to reskill myself in sustainable energy. I searched lots of universities in the UK and chose UEL because of the available courses. I particularly loved the MBA Sustainable Energy course which was available only at UEL. I’m very happy to be here.”
Professor Marshall also took the opportunity at the event to announce two new career programmes at UEL: the Integrated Career Development Pathway and the Graduate Success Service.
The Integrated Career Development Pathway will provide students with hands-on experience by working directly with industry partners in real-world applications and to industry standards. This initiative is supported by five sponsors: Siemens, Barts Health, Enterprise, Skyscanner, and ExCeL.
An executive from one of those companies, Simon Burgess, Head of Sales and Solutions Development at Siemens, noted how pleased his company was to be working with the University on programmes like the pathway. He said,
I am always blown away by the activities that UEL does to support its students and connect them with employer partners. At Siemens, we have recently taken on seven interns from UEL and they have made a really important contribution to our business. We’re really proud of our partnership with UEL and hope to continue working together for many years.""
The other new careers programme, the Graduate Success Service, will be launched on 1 July 2024 and is designed to offer additional support to graduates once they leave the University. “When our students transition to graduation, we continue to support them in those critical first few years post-graduation,” Dr Marshall explained, “the Graduate Success Service aims to increase the visibility of these activities.”
The service will also enhance support for UEL’s large Indian alumni community by appointing a careers advisor based in India.
Professor Marshall said, “UEL is dedicated to the long-term success of its graduates, both locally and internationally, ensuring they have access to the necessary resources and support throughout their careers.”
Before the awards, Olympic champion Christine Ohuruogu MBE delivered an inspiring keynote address, sharing her journey from being a young girl growing up in Newham, through her success as a professional athlete to her current career in sports arbitration and consulting.
Christine said, “Newham serves as a reminder of my roots. Growing up, it was important to excel despite negative perceptions about Newham and east London. UEL’s efforts to positively impact the community demonstrate the power of innovation and creativity.”
As a visiting ambassador for UEL, Christine praised the University’s work within the Newham community, particularly its Sport in your Future programme which offers local schoolchildren the chance to try out a diverse range of sports and activities.
She said,
I’ve just spent a fun morning with the Sport in your Futures programme. There were around 450 youngsters trying out wheelchair basketball, breakdancing, skateboarding, and seated volleyball. These are young people who never would have had the opportunity to try these sports. It’s a real credit to UEL for thinking outside the box.
I’m really happy that UEL is trying to make a positive impact in the community. We are really seeing legacy in motion, so it’s a real privilege to join UEL in this way.""
This year, the celebration took place as part of the University’s Innovation and Enterprise Summer Festival, a cornerstone event of the University’s Year of Science.
With this in mind, the Student and Partner Celebration began with a panel discussion entitled “Can AI be the Great Equaliser for Inclusivity in Recruitment?”
Experts from diverse fields explored how artificial intelligence can transform recruitment to make it more equitable and inclusive. The panel featured insights from Nicky Garcea (Cappfinity), Anthony Malumbe (Accenture), Dr Julie Wall (University of West London), Dr Mohammad Hossein Amirhosseini (UEL), Tracey Dawes (Reed Talent Solutions), Alexander Maxwell-Cole (UEL), and Sandy Tung (Greater London Authority).

Tue 27 July, 2021Luton Poet Laureate and double Law graduate from the University of Bedfordshire, Mary Emeji, has been crowned ‘Adult Achiever’ in the Luton’s Best Awards, which highlight the incredible work that individuals perform to improve the town.
This Luton’s Best award adds to Mary’s plethora of achievements that she has gathered over her twelve years as a successful author – from publishing eight poetry collections to an International Performance Poet Award.
Mary was delighted to be awarded for her hard work in the community. She said: “It’s been an amazing journey working with the Luton community to inspire poetry in our beautiful town. We now have more authors than ever before!
“I love Luton and it's a delightful honour to win the Adult Achiever award. I enjoy working with the community of poets in our beautiful town.”
Mary’s work within the community includes founding Luton’s first Poetry Society in 2011 which she continued to run during the Covid-19 pandemic, hosting online meetings and providing members with support throughout the lockdowns. Twelve members of the Poetry Society have since become published authors.
Reflecting on the journey of the society, she said: “I founded the very first Luton Poetry Society ten years ago in 2011. I love performing poetry and so I thought about having a group recital with a few friends, then my friends became many!
“Today we have a wonderful community of poets who inspire each other. We have very much grown and enhanced the Luton community with our regular poetry readings and workshops.”
As the sponsor of Luton’s Best Adult Achiever award, the University of Bedfordshire takes pride in supporting its local community at every opportunity. However, it was an additional honour that a Beds graduate collected the award.
Upon hearing the latest of Mary’s achievements, the University’s Corporate Events Manager Rosie Munro said: “The University is a longstanding partner and sponsor of the Luton’s Best Awards and it is always fantastic to see some inspiring local figures get the recognition they deserve.
“It is, of course, even more special for us when somebody linked with the University wins an award. Mary is a real star graduate who is making a tangible difference to the Luton area, setting a standard for how creativity and talent can be a driving force for change.
“Congratulations Mary and all the other Luton’s Best winners.”
Since graduating with a Distinction in her LLM, Mary has returned to the University of Bedfordshire as a guest speaker and recited her award winning poetry. She continued: ""It's always wonderful to be back at the University and I enjoy my poetry workshops with the students. There is so much talent here at Beds and I look forward to even more students becoming authors.""
Although the Luton’s Best Awards ceremony has taken place this year, the award winners will be regarded as 2020 winners due to last year’s ceremony being postponed as the country was subjected to numerous lockdowns. In partnership with Love Luton, the Luton’s Best Awards have finally been able to commend all the truly inspirational work individuals and businesses have continued to carry out in a year like no other.
Along with Mary, there were many other award winners on the celebratory night. Award categories included: Young Achiever, Best Fundraiser, Lifetime Achievement and Environmental Achievement.
The full list of nominees and winners is available to view on the Luton's Best Awards website.

We're interested in how it is currently used and could be used in the near future. Here is our quick overview for anyone interested in how it relates to their studies or research.
AI can mean a lot of different things to many different people so we're going to particularly focus on two aspects of AI that you may have come across in the last year or so - Generative AI and Retrieval Augmented Generation.
Gen AI is a part of an AI system that has the ability or function to generate new content (such as words, images, video, audio) autonomously. You may have used Gen AI in an app such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing or used it to generate entirely new images using software such as Midjourney. Gen AI encourages the use of prompts/questions to engage with any software that integrates with it to produce a desirable outcome.
RAG combines Gen AI with existing sources of knowledge (such as PDFs of journal articles or datasets). In a two-step process it retrieves information for sources and then produces a Gen AI summary directly based on the sources. This is said to increase accuracy of the outcome of using AI as what is generated has less ways it could hallucinate or produce wrong facts. You may have used RAG based AI to 'chat with a PDF' or have used it to prompt from a knowledge base where you have at least some pre-existing experience with the information, data or processes.
With such new (and powerful) technology there is always the need to be aware of some key facts and considerations:
We are actively looking at AI where it relates to our collections and services. We are currently involved in 'community of practice' initiatives to share knowledge, co-create and analyse the impact of new tools and platforms.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) will replace jobs but create a wide range of ones ‘we don’t yet know exist’, that’s according to Professor John Murray, Academic Dean of the Faculty of Business and Technology at the University of Sunderland.
Following the launch of Chinese AI app DeepSeek, Professor Murray shares his thoughts about the recent advancement of AI and how it could impact people and businesses across the world.
“I get asked the question a lot whether I think these AI models are going to replace jobs.
Humanity has always innovated; we are always developing. The whole nature of innovation is looking at how we do things quicker, smarter, cheaper, more effectively and ultimately that will replace jobs.
A great example of this was when the personal computer started to arrive in the 70s. People said it’s going to put people out of work, and it absolutely did.
But what we also saw was it created far more jobs than it ever replaced; new jobs that didn’t exist before the computer that outweighed the number of jobs it took.
AI is a similar thing – it’s going to replace jobs but also create new opportunities that we have never thought of - jobs that we don’t yet know exist.
We can already see this in how people are using AI to innovate. For example, consider someone who might not have the artistic skills to get into the field of graphic design but have a creative flare.
These individuals have found a new way of using generative AI to augment their skills and skillsets to help them create new entrepreneurial businesses to generate new marketing materials.
AI will help push us forward in our development as a society and as a people, no doubt about it.
This innovation recently accelerated after DeepSeek found a way of developing a new algorithm that needs less processing power and less powerful graphics cards that are needed to run AI models.
But now people are saying, if you can deliver such a model on low end graphics cards, what can you deliver with this model on high-end ones. That’s making people quite excited about the potential of this.
If you go back two or three years ago, organisations and businesses had access to chatbots then, but these were very basic and simplistic, it was easy to tell they were AI.
When OpenAI launched ChatGPT, that saw a massive shift on how real the conversations between you and the chatbot felt.
But then people started to find issues with it. We found that it made up, or ‘hallucinated’ information, so it wasn’t as reliable as people first thought. AI models lacked critical analysis and couldn’t rationalise information.
DeepSeek might be able to do that and that’s where the next advances might be. But because it’s so new and no one has tested it, that’s still open to debate.
Whether it’s a Sputnik event, I’m not sure, but it’s definitely another steep step in the development of technology.”",1446,42.1,University of Sunderland,16.0,9.9,13320,1446,sunderland.ac.uk,18.2,237:36,,71.6,United Kingdom,news,4.425142314845512,0.5805168986083499,517,False,1446,"Prof John Murray on AI | The University of Sunderland

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has had an extraordinary journey. From the early days of the Turing test and symbolic reasoning – which rose to prominence in the 1950s – to the 21st century’s cutting-edge advancements in deep learning and neural networks, the field of AI has witnessed remarkable progress.
Today, AI is embedded in our lives in a myriad of ways – across both business processes and people’s daily routines – and experts agree that emerging areas of artificial intelligence, such as generative AI, will further cement its role in society.
But to better understand the future, it can help to first look back. Exploring and understanding the historical approaches to AI highlight how they paved the way for the modern approaches that are shaping the landscape of AI now. And by understanding the foundations and evolution of AI, we can better appreciate its transformative potential for the years ahead.
Historical approaches to artificial intelligence
The quest for creating intelligent machines dates back to the early days of computer science. In the mid-20th century, the focus was on developing algorithms and formal logic to simulate human intelligence.
This era saw the emergence of symbolic AI, which aimed to represent knowledge and solve problems using rules and logical operations. First-order logic and knowledge representation played pivotal roles in this approach, allowing AI systems to reason and make decisions based on logical inference, and pseudocode and early programming languages like LISP were used to implement AI algorithms.
As AI research progressed, the limitations of symbolic AI became apparent, especially in dealing with uncertain knowledge and complex real-world scenarios. To tackle these challenges, probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian approaches – based on the mathematical theorem of Thomas Bayes – gained prominence. Other advances included probabilistic graphical models, such as hidden Markov models, which enable AI systems to handle uncertain data and make informed decisions under probabilistic constraints.
Modern developments in artificial intelligence
Machine learning and neural networks
One of the most significant breakthroughs in AI came with the advent of machine learning and neural networks.
Machine learning revolutionised the practice of artificial intelligence by enabling systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time.
Neural networks, meanwhile, are inspired by the human brain, making connections between computer nodes the way the human brain makes connections between neurons.
These technologies have formed the backbone of deep learning, which is a sub-area of machine learning and neural networks, one that aims to train AI models with multiple layers and enable machines to learn in a way similar to human beings. In this way, AI can identify and extract complex patterns and representations from data.
The paradigm shift created by machine learning and neural networks has allowed AI systems to tackle a wide range of problem-solving tasks, from search algorithms to computer vision and natural language processing.
Computer vision and natural language processing
Computer vision, a subfield of AI, has witnessed tremendous advancements in recent years. By leveraging deep learning techniques and neural networks, computer vision systems can now accurately interpret and understand visual data, enabling applications such as object detection, image recognition, and autonomous driving.
Natural language processing, meanwhile, teaches AI systems to understand semantics and generate human language. From chatbots to language translation, natural language processing has opened up new frontiers in human-computer interaction.
Reinforcement learning and decision making
Reinforcement learning, a branch of machine learning, takes inspiration from behavioural psychology to train AI agents through interactions with their environments. By rewarding desirable actions and penalising undesirable ones, reinforcement learning algorithms can learn optimal decision-making strategies.
This approach has proven to be instrumental in developing AI systems that excel in complex decision-making tasks, such as playing games like chess and Go, or controlling autonomous vehicles.
Multi-agent systems and AI collaboration
The notion of intelligent agents working together in a collaborative manner has been gaining traction in the field of AI. Multi-agent systems aim to develop algorithms and frameworks that enable multiple AI agents to interact, communicate, and coordinate their actions in order to achieve common goals. This approach has broad applications, ranging from distributed robotics to supply chain optimisation, where multiple agents must cooperate to solve complex problems efficiently.
Future directions and challenges
As AI continues to evolve, new frontiers and challenges emerge. Probabilistic programming, for instance, aims to combine the power of probabilistic reasoning with traditional programming, opening up opportunities for building AI systems that can reason and make decisions in uncertain conditions. Additionally, the field of AI ethics is gaining prominence, addressing concerns related to bias, fairness, and accountability in AI algorithms and systems.
Today, society stands at the forefront of AI research and implementation. By embracing modern approaches to AI, people and organisations can harness its potential to tackle both simple decisions and complex decisions, improve problem-solving capabilities, and advance various fields, from health care to environmental sustainability.

- Respect for human dignity
- Freedom
- Democracy
- Equality
- The rule of law
- Respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.
As one of the key values – and underpinning all of the values – EU law is critical to how the Union is designed and how it functions. The values are based on protecting fundamental rights – especially basic human rights. Detailed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the rights, freedoms and principles include aspects such as: the right to life; prohibition of slavery and forced labour; the right to education; the right to asylum; non-discrimination; state aid; the right to vote; and free movement within the EU.
How does European law work?
The EU – which has 27 member states – is based on the rule of law.
According to the European Commission, this means that “every action taken by the EU is founded on treaties that have been approved democratically by its members. EU laws help to achieve the objectives of the EU treaties and put EU policies into practice.”
These treaties form the basis of how the EU is structured and governed. Any legislation, change to legislation, or disputes regarding legislation, is handled by the:
- European Commission, who proposed the laws
- European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, who pass the proposals
- Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), who deal with disputes regarding their interpretation. Based in Luxembourg, the CJEU ensures that EU law is interpreted, applied, and abided by, the same in every EU country.
The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) is one of two main treaties that form the basis of EU law.
The adoption of the majority of EU laws follows a routine legislative process: the European Parliament, together with the Council of the EU – which features representatives from all 27 countries – have equal say and must agree on any proposal for it to become EU law. Throughout the member states, national parliaments all receive the legislative proposals and can react with opinions. In some cases, national parliaments can advise whether they deem action to be more effective at national or regional level.
Types of EU law
EU law is separated into two main types – primary (treaties) and secondary (regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations and opinions):
- Treaties. These are the fundamental laws governing the EU and set out the rules for how EU institutions function. Each treaty must be passed and agreed – i.e. ratified – by EU member states. Any expansion and development of the EU, much like its founding, is underpinned by treaty agreements among all member states in the European community.
- Regulations. These are laws applying to all member states and form part of national law. As they come into force, they can be enforced through national courts.
- Directives. These are goal-setting laws that member states must implement, usually accompanied by a deadline. However, directives do not dictate the decision-making and means by which a state must implement the law. Each state can introduce laws that transpose directives into national law.
- Decisions. These are laws that are only relevant to specified bodies, and have a direct effect on either the country or organisation that the decision relates to.
- Recommendations and opinions. These comprise non-binding recommendations or advice that member states can choose to follow if they wish to.
Access to justice within the EU
The European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) was established to ensure that EU governments did not dehumanise and abuse people’s rights with impunity. It protects the human rights of those in countries that belong to the Council of Europe.
If a member of the European community’s rights are violated – by an individual or anyone else – they have the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal. In EU law, particular attention is paid to specific groups of victims, including: victims of trafficking; children; and victims of terrorism.
For those who are either suspects or accused in criminal proceedings, the Charter also demands the right to a fair trial. This means they must receive minimum procedural safeguards within EU member states.
What is the difference between EU law and international law?
While EU law is technically a specific form of international law, there do exist some key differences within its main body. For example, EU citizens have the ability to invoke rights that are guaranteed by EU law before courts in European Union member states. Generally, under international law, laws must be transposed into national law before citizens are able to plead them.
Often, EU law prevails over the law of the individual member states.
How does EU law affect the United Kingdom?
Since Brexit, the United Kingdom (UK) is no longer a member of the EU. European Union Law and legislation – as it directly or indirectly applied to the UK on 31 December 2020 – is now part of UK domestic legislation, known as ‘retained EU legislation’. As per the European Union (Withdrawal) Act (2018), “any remaining EU rights and obligations, including directly effective rights within EU treaties, continue to be recognised and available in domestic law after exit.”
Further Acts uphold the relationship, and the arrangements, between the UK and the EU. This includes aspects such as security procedures regarding the exchange and protection of classified information, trade and cooperation, and nuclear cooperation.

The House of Commons Library elaborates on these primary interests, stating that, “there can also be less obvious third-party interests, for instance: covenants, easements, minor and overriding interests. In respect of any one property, these different interests can co-exist and interact.” Issues that arise in land law often involve:
- Tracing the ownership of registered and unregistered land
- Resolving boundary disputes
- Enforcing or discharging restrictive covenants on freehold land
- Understanding private rights of way
What are the sources of land law?
Ownership of land came out of the feudal system which was established by William the Conqueror in the 11th Century. This may seem like a long time ago, but much of current land ownership in England can be charted back to the events following 1066, when the land was divided amongst gentry. For example, the Grosvenor family, which owns a large proportion of some of the most valuable real estate in London, arrived with William the Conqueror. Originally the family only owned land in Cheshire, but it was Sir Thomas Grosvenor’s marriage in 1677 to Mary Davies that changed that. Mary had inherited the “swampy meads” which became Mayfair, Park Lane, and Belgravia and so they became part of the Grosvenor Estate (Thomas Grosvenor is an ancestor of the Duke of Westminster).
Incidentally, it wasn’t until 1870 that the Married Women’s Property Act was passed, which treated any money that a woman earned as her own property. This law was then extended in 1882 to include inheritance or ownership of a piece of land as property, and not exclusively chattels, such as jewellery or furniture (chattels can also be attached to a piece of land and are then called fixtures). The Law of Property Act 1922 enabled husband or wife to inherit each other’s property, but it wasn’t until 1926 that legislation was passed that permitted women to own land and dispose of property on the same terms as men.
The content of English land law relates to property rights that have been derived from the old courts of common law, equity, and the registration system. For this reason, much of the language around land law is relatively archaic and requires knowledge of the vocabulary. Key legislation that has been built upon these ancient principles includes the Law of Property Act 1925, the Settled Land Act 1925, the Land Charges Act 1972, the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996, and the Land Registration Act 2002.
Surprisingly, approximately 15% of land in England and Wales remains unregistered. Although The Land Registry came into being in 1862, it wasn’t until 1990 that compulsory registration came into force across the whole of England and Wales. Solicitors charge more for unregistered title conveyances because it requires the searching through of old deeds.
What are the basic laws of the land?
“Law of the land” as a phrase primarily refers to all of the laws enforced within a country. It comes from the Latin lex terrae and was used in the Magna Carta (1215). It is also a phrase used in the United States Constitution of 1787. The fundamental law of the land in its entirety is indeed a constitution.
When we’re referring to laws to do with land usage and ownership, the term that is used is land law. This sector of law is fairly complex and so cannot be boiled down to basics or explained without going into detail.
What is the difference between property law and land law?
Also known by the name law of real property, land law is principally concerned with acquiring or protecting land, and settling disputes or conflict around people’s rights, both legal and equitable, in land. The European Convention on Human Rights was brought into English law by the Human Rights Act 1998. This means that governments cannot take property away from lawful owners for public use – relevant at any point in time, but particularly so during times of war or conflict.
The highest possible form of ownership in land law is known as a fee simple absolute. This means that there are no limitations on land use and the property is real property held without any time limit, so permanently, making it freehold not leasehold.
Property law is referred to as real estate law in some quarters. It deals with residential and commercial property and related transactions, as well as specialist areas including property finance, mortgage lending, and social housing. Property law is concerned with tenancies, leases or licences, easements, mortgages, and adverse possessions, however, it overlaps with land law on matters of transfer of land, ownership of land, and disputes over land.
The five basic principles of property law are:
- The right of possession
- The right of control
- The right of exclusion
- The right to derive income
- The right of disposition
What is the right to roam?
Sometimes referred to as freedom to roam, right of public access to the wilderness, or everyman’s right, the right to roam allows the general public access to privately owned land, lakes, and rivers for reasons of recreation and exercise. However, over 92% of England’s land is privately owned, so not available to access, and 97% of rivers are inaccessible to the public. This includes many green, open spaces that could benefit people’s mental and physical health.
During the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, more people were visiting sites of interest such as national parks and common land, for example, land under the stewardship of the National Trust. It became apparent then that not much of the land in England is available for all. But also that many were littering or misusing the land that they could access. It brought up issues of how we treat the land, with some arguing that without true access, it is difficult for the public to appreciate the land and so care for it accordingly.
In 2021, Chris Packham campaigned for the 615,000-acre portfolio of real estate belonging to the royal family, known as the crown estate, to be rewilded. This proposal for a change of land use would include Balmoral and Sandringham, and although discussions with the crown estate have been positive, they are ongoing. This question of land use in relation to environmentalism is set to become more prevalent with the introduction of laws that give living entities, which support the ecosystem, the same rights as human beings.

- The right of control
- The right of exclusion
- The right to derive income
- The right of disposition
What is the right to roam?
Sometimes referred to as freedom to roam, right of public access to the wilderness, or everyman’s right, the right to roam allows the general public access to privately owned land, lakes, and rivers for reasons of recreation and exercise. However, over 92% of England’s land is privately owned, so not available to access, and 97% of rivers are inaccessible to the public. This includes many green, open spaces that could benefit people’s mental and physical health.
During the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, more people were visiting sites of interest such as national parks and common land, for example, land under the stewardship of the National Trust. It became apparent then that not much of the land in England is available for all. But also that many were littering or misusing the land that they could access. It brought up issues of how we treat the land, with some arguing that without true access, it is difficult for the public to appreciate the land and so care for it accordingly.
In 2021, Chris Packham campaigned for the 615,000-acre portfolio of real estate belonging to the royal family, known as the crown estate, to be rewilded. This proposal for a change of land use would include Balmoral and Sandringham, and although discussions with the crown estate have been positive, they are ongoing. This question of land use in relation to environmentalism is set to become more prevalent with the introduction of laws that give living entities, which support the ecosystem, the same rights as human beings.

Design; Disruption; Divergence will be available to view in person at TheGallery on AUB Campus, and, in a first for the University, also in a virtual exhibition space for the duration.
The exhibition will explore Generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence used to create new content. It'll also explore identity politics in digital representation and creative AI, authenticity, diversity, and ownership in digital spaces.
Jennifer Anyan, Director of the University's School of Arts, Media, and Creative Industries Management, curated the exhibition.
“Design; Disruption; Divergence doesn’t just showcase what AI can make,"" she explains. ""It interrogates what AI means for the act of making itself.
“There's been a surge in the Generative AI technology that's available to the general public; if artificial intelligence can generate ideas that have so far been the preserve of creative people, what does this mean for the practice of creatives, of designers, for artists?”
Alongside photography, film, fashion, textiles, and object-based work, the exhibition’s headline act is a communicative hologram of Shudu Gram, one of the world’s first digital supermodels and newly announced Industry Patron for AUB, the University’s first AI Industry Patron.
Shudu was created in 2017 by fashion photographer, AUB alumnus and MA Digital Fashion Innovation visiting tutor Cameron-James Wilson, she has her own Instagram and has already been on the front cover of Vogue.
“Shudu will be there in hologram form,"" says Jennifer. ""We’ve also been working in collaboration with Cameron and using Generative AI to enable her to communicate with visitors – it will be quite the show!”
In addition to the physical exhibition in TheGallery on site at AUB, staff and students have also developed a virtual exhibition space so people with access to a VR headset can visit remotely.
Jennifer continues, “We’ve invited those engaging with Generative AI through their own creative practice, to look at what the opportunities are, what the ethical dilemmas are and how we understand and explore this new tool.”
Lisa Moro, a graduate of both BA (Hons) Fine Art and MA Fine Art at AUB, is exhibiting her work, The English Dragon Snake, at Design; Disruption; Divergence. She explains how she used AI tools to recreate the memory of a friend:
“I used AI to translate the fragmented recollections of childhood games shared by Vietnamese friends into animation and sound, filtered through my English understanding.
“Using Gravity Sketch in VR, I visualised AI-generated imagery derived from translated game descriptions. The AI’s surreal distortions—figures floating or morphing unexpectedly—highlighted the slippages in cultural translation.
“For sound, I used AI-generated lyrics in both Vietnamese and English, transformed into song with word-to-vocal software, reinforcing the theme of linguistic mediation. This process underscored AI’s role not as a direct translator but as an unpredictable collaborator in reshaping memory.”
Jennifer adds, “In a time when algorithms are part of our everyday world, this exhibition is all about how AI collaborates with human imagination. AI emerges here as more than just an assistant; it’s a mirror reflecting our hopes and anxieties about the future of creativity in the digital age.
“These works illustrate AUB’s proactive engagement with AI and its impact on creative industries, underscoring the need for human guidance and design thinking in shaping its role in artistic practice.""

One starting point is to find out where you are with your own knowledge and the Jisc discovery tool can assist with this.
The discovery tool, which was introduced to UON in 2020, is a developmental tool that students and staff can use to self-assess their digital capabilities, identify their strengths, and highlight opportunities to develop skills. The tool has been recently updated to include a question set for both staff and students on their capability and proficiency with AI and generative AI tools.
The question sets for students and staff have been developed with assistance from Jisc and aligns with the latest AI advice and AI guiding principles developed by Jisc and the Russell Group on the responsible and equitable use of AI to enhance learning and teaching.
How the discovery tool helps students and teachers
The new question sets provide users with a basis to self-assess their skills and knowledge of what AI is and how it could, or should, be used in the context of their studies or role.
Once users complete the question set, they can then access a personalised report with a confidence rating which will vary from ‘developing’ through ‘capable’ to ‘proficient’ depending on their experience. The report also provides recommendations and courses on how to advance knowledge around AI.
Users can repeat any of the discovery tool’s question sets at any point and therefore keep a dynamic view of their confidence levels.
Where can I access the tool?
Click here to log straight into the discovery tool and the AI question set, or copy and paste the link below into your address bar.
How can I Support Students?
To assist students in enhancing their digital skills and their knowledge and understanding of AI, we have put together a student guide which can be found here. It may also be helpful to add a link to this guide, or to the discovery tool itself, within NILE courses.
What if I would like to know more?
For more information about how to use the discovery tool, see: 
For further information about the AI design assistant in NILE or Padlet’s new AI features, please get in touch with your Learning Technologist.

Whilst we are getting familiar with different technologies, we don’t always step back and have a look at the big picture of our digital capability profile. Doing this allows us to pick out areas where we may need to spend a bit more time for self improvement – working smarter and not harder.
The University has just subscribed to a tool which allows all staff and students to complete a simple set of questions and be directed to useful resources depending on the answers provided. This builds on requests in recent staff and student questionnaires for a way in which people could identify their current skills and areas for improvement.
Whilst the results are personal to the individual completing the questions – there is an opportunity to export the results to share with others during discussions (such as line manager or personal tutor).
In order to access the tool then:
Log in at with these details:
Put the Organisation as ‘University of Northampton
Login with your normal staff or student account.
If this is the first time you have logged in then just complete the registration information.
For staff, from the home page on the left click onto “Explore your overall digital capabilities”
For students, from the home page on the left click onto “New students” or “Current students” depending on your status.
Once you have completed the questions (approx 10 mins) then a report will be generated to show areas where you are strong or need to improve on 15 different dimensions:
Below the chart will be a list of suggested links to develop your skills in each of the areas shown.
You can redo the questions at any point to update your profile.
Having a good Digital fitness or capability can also help to enhance your employability prospects and help to develop your employability skills.

You have 30,000 days on Earth. Here’s how to decide how to spend yours
When I finished my MBA at London Business School back in 2007, I found myself in a world strikingly similar to the one graduates face today. 2007 was a moment of jolting economic uncertainty. True, Lehman Brothers had yet to collapse (that was September 2008), but the global financial crisis was already brewing – the signs were there, especially in the US subprime mortgage market. The S&P 500 would go on to lose over half its value between October 2007 and March 2009. Today, graduates are confronted by a similar type of financial uncertainty – in addition to surging geopolitical instability, persistent inflation and the onrush of AI that is already reshaping the world of work.
Back in 2007, the iPhone had just been launched, bringing with it the start of the mobile and social media revolution. In 2025, graduates are attempting to decode what Generative AI will mean for their careers and the skills they’ll need to succeed. Globalization and the rise of the Internet economy meant the job market in 2007 was changing rapidly, with traditional, linear career paths slowly being replaced by ‘zigzag’ careers and the need for continuous learning. If anything, today's job market is even less predictable. From the gig economy, remote and hybrid work, to portfolio careers, project-based work and side hustles, there is no longer a single definition of work, which is disorientating yet exciting for ambitious graduates.
And that’s pretty much where the similarities end. Today’s graduates face a world that is going through technological and economic upheaval that is, if anything, accelerating, with global challenges – including political polarization, multifaceted global conflicts as well as climate change – that are arguably more complex than at any point in history.
I opted to do an MBA because I wanted to expand the peripheral vision of my career – and it ultimately became the catalyst for me moving to Silicon Valley, where I would go on to be part of the early days at Uber and Dropbox, before returning to Europe and joining Balderton Capital, and later co-founding my own venture capital firm. Back in 2007, the job market appeared in dire straits, and I wish I’d had someone to give me practical and clear-eyed career advice at the time. For those of you deciding what to do next, I want to be that person for you today.
“There is no longer a single definition of work, which is disorientating yet exciting for ambitious graduates”
Thinking strategically about your career from the start can save you years of trial and error, especially in the world of fast-growing startups which have always been at the heart of my journey. It’s a path that has taken me from being an operator and entrepreneur to the boardroom, before evolving into an angel investor, and ultimately a venture capitalist. Here are my ten key takeaways from those whirlwind decades.
Never fly blind – always be aware of the macro trends that are shaping the world around you and therefore the job market. Currently there are four growth areas. The first and most significant is AI, specifically the rise of Generative AI, which is changing the world of work and jobs arguably at a faster rate than any technology in history. What does that mean for you? AI literacy will be non-negotiable. Make familiarizing yourself with the major GenAI tools out there, and understanding the structure of the wider ecosystem, your top priority. Every industry will require AI-related skills. Stay informed, experiment, and be ready to adapt.
Other key areas to deep dive within include Sustainability & Climate – while VCs are investing less in that field versus pre-2021, it is still a high-demand area and will be a major driver of future jobs and opportunity. Go where the action is – look for emerging innovation hubs and red-hot sectors which correlate with global trends. For example, geopolitical turbulence and global rearmament is seeing multiple billions being poured into defense and defense-tech. The same goes for deeptech and future industries such as quantum computing – an area I’m really excited about – space-tech, drug discovery and biohacking. The overarching theme, however, is AI, and I predict we will soon see the first company created by a single founder with no employees cross the billion-dollar valuation threshold, simply using AI APIs. The boundaries are stretching.
Ikigai is a Japanese idea meaning ‘Reason for being’. Your career should align with four key factors: What you love; What you’re good at; What the world needs; and What you can be paid for. When you find this balance, work feels meaningful, and success flows naturally. Now is the moment to take a step back and go through these exercises. Really get to know yourself. It’ll help you avoid certain landmines later. (You can explore Ikigai further here and here.).
Similarly, use strategic business principles to develop a life strategy. You have 30,000 days on Earth, give or take, and you’ll want to spend them wisely. And if you drill down further – as I’ve argued before – you really only have about the span of two Olympic Games cycles to establish yourself. That’s eight years to really understand your values, interests and ambition – and what you excel at – to peak perform during those two cycles.
One of the best hacks I’ve come across for doing that is Strategize Your life™ devised by Rainer Strack, Senior Partner Emeritus at Boston Consulting Group. Rainer adapted the model for strategic thinking that they use with corporate clients to help people design better futures for themselves. The model involves seven steps with each guided by a question: How do I define a great life? What is my life purpose? What is my life vision? How do I assess my life portfolio? What can I learn from benchmarks? What portfolio choices can I make? How can I ensure a successful, sustained life change? As Rainer says this isn’t a “golden path to happiness or life satisfaction”, but a way to figure out your life strategy. (Learn more about it here.)
The Enneagram is a personality test (see image above) which is incredibly powerful for building an uncannily accurate profile of how you think, feel and act – the results feel like they come from someone who has known you your whole life, It helps you understand what your beliefs are, your values, goals and what you really want (aka your personal North Star) – and that level of self-awareness is key for making more conscious choices about our actions, which direction to go in etc. It’s particularly useful when you’re thinking about the culture of a firm you’re considering joining – whether you’ll fit in there, how you’ll manage your relationships and so on. This stuff really matters, so I urge you to take it.
“You really only have about the span of two Olympic Games cycles to establish yourself”
When you start your job/opportunity search, you need to be clear about your appetite for risk. What is your personality type (see #4)? With, for example, debts to pay off from your studies, are you someone who may be more comfortable with the stability, salary and benefits a large corporation can offer – not to mention the ability to climb the ladder? Or are you a risk-taker, comfortable with the fluidity and uncertainty that comes with founding or joining a startup, and taking a low salary alongside equity with the potential for enormous upside?
Understanding your tolerance for risk is fundamental for helping you navigate career decisions – whether that’s jumping on board an early-stage company, joining a Big Tech or legacy tech firm or indeed breaking into venture capital. The last thing you want is to be a year into your new journey and realize you made the wrong choice for reasons you could have predicted by doing your homework, ahead of taking the leap.
To minimize risk, I would go as far as to say that if you want to found your own startup, first go and join a company with momentum – and learn from them. However, if we start with the premise that you want to work for a technology company (venture-backed startup, scale-up or established corporate), begin by mapping out the tech landscape using a worksheet: on the x-axis you’ll cover categories such as ‘Geography’ (i.e. where a company’s based), ‘Industry sector’, ‘Upside/risk’ (i.e. your risk appetite), ‘Salary & stock’, ‘Company size’, ‘Culture’ (I always think of this as the company’s ‘blood type’ – either it matches with yours or it doesn’t), ‘Brand’ (joining a company with a strong brand will always open doors for you), ‘Momentum’, ‘Funding stage’ and so on, including how you would rate a company against your personal North Star. Then along the y-axis list the top VCs (ideally you want to join a company with strong investors) and pick the portfolio companies that are performing well that interest you – then cross-reference them with each category.
Now take that process a step further and write an investment memo (or offering memo) for, say, the three companies you most want to work for in the form of a pitch deck that provides a comprehensive overview and all the key metrics as if written for investors. Approach it as if you were making the case for investing your own money into this company. That will help you understand its value proposition and market position, and ensure you stand out as a candidate. When I invest in early-stage companies, I broadly look across four key themes: ‘Team’, ‘Product’, ‘Monetization’ and ‘Timing’. You can read more about that here. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, however, and typically VCs and angels have different methodologies. The one thing everyone can agree on though is that luck plays a big part in success.
VC is often seen as something you get into only if you want to become an investor. But there are actually three types of jobs in VC. The first and most obvious is indeed investing (see the image above), with roles ranging from General Partner to an entry-level Analyst. Next there’s the Platform team, covering Talent, Marketing, Sales & Business Development and so on. Finally, Operations encompasses fields such as Finance, Legal and Communications. Working in VC can mean working in any of them, and even if you want to become an investor, your entry point doesn’t need to be an investing role. Whether it’s an operational, finance, or a portfolio support role, getting your foot in the door is what matters. Once inside, opportunities will open up. If you do decide that nothing will stop you from becoming an investor, a great way to break in is to get experience as an angel investor or as a scout, build your contacts among startups, and bring VCs deal flow.
Once again, my strong suggestion here is that you map out the VC universe, detailing the key firms, partner profiles, where they are located, the categories they specialize in, their breakout portfolio companies, their own fund raises, their exits, etc. And then do a deep dive into what people – especially founders – say about them in media coverage and on social media, review sites such as Glassdoor, and then rate all of these against your personal North Star. Once you’ve narrowed your choices down to, say, half a dozen firms then track down alumni on LinkedIn and start building relationships. Read more from my former Partner at Balderton, Suranga Chandratillake here.
Arguably a lot of success comes from specialization and branding – pick an important niche that you love, focus on it and aim to be the best in that area. However, just as we often refer to the TAM (total addressable market) in venture capital, ensure your niche is large. This will always set you apart in competitive industries and focus your story and reputation. In my case, I became obsessed with large impact deal-making and business development – especially new types of deals that could be measured and patented. Filing patents always made me feel like a digital explorer. There are invariably jobs going at VC firms and technology companies, even if they are not advertised publicly. Being among the best in your field is your fast-track in.
If a company doesn’t align with your goals or values, or it isn’t taking you in the direction you want to go in – or you just feel stuck – do not hesitate to leave. Remember: you have two Olympic cycles to make an impact. Staying too long in the wrong environment or role can seriously hamper your career and personal growth, and it potentially hurts your employer. As Steve Jobs said in his 2005 Stanford commencement speech: “For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”
However, this isn’t about moving on as soon as you experience a bump or two in the road. Always remember we grow most facing adversity. Make sure you are patient and prioritize the right things. For example, don’t be dazzled by a job title, instead prioritize your co-workers, the value of the work you do and results you achieve, as a team. Remember: your colleagues are your strongest advocates. Similarly, always keep in mind what’s best for the company – which should be your North Star on the job. If you find that on too many occasions your personal North Star is not aligned with what’s best for your employer, then make adjustments or move on.
Many of the most successful entrepreneurs, investors and business leaders have faced multiple setbacks along the way. Failure, per se, doesn’t matter. Learning from your mistakes, rebounding and iterating quickly does. In a world of increasing technological change and shifting career paths, resilience is one of the most valuable skills you can develop. So don’t let fear of failure prevent you from taking risks, exploring new opportunities or pushing yourself far beyond your comfort zone.
I learned this firsthand when I was laid off from VoiceSignal. At the time, I didn’t understand why it had happened to me. It was disorienting, and I was left questioning my next steps. However, that unexpected event set off a chain reaction that would shape the rest of my career. It led me to join Dropbox, which then opened the door to joining Uber, and so on…
What seemed like a setback at the time propelled me on a path towards something even bigger. Later, I discovered that VoiceSignal had been mired in a lawsuit with Google, and that was the real reason for my layoff – something entirely out of my control. So take the big swings. If you fail, fail fast, learn, and keep going. Your biggest breakthroughs often come from your biggest challenges.
However always remember, a meal is only as good as the last bite. First impressions land the interview, but lasting impressions land your next dream job.

The Enneagram is a personality test (see image above) which is incredibly powerful for building an uncannily accurate profile of how you think, feel and act – the results feel like they come from someone who has known you your whole life, It helps you understand what your beliefs are, your values, goals and what you really want (aka your personal North Star) – and that level of self-awareness is key for making more conscious choices about our actions, which direction to go in etc. It’s particularly useful when you’re thinking about the culture of a firm you’re considering joining – whether you’ll fit in there, how you’ll manage your relationships and so on. This stuff really matters, so I urge you to take it.
“You really only have about the span of two Olympic Games cycles to establish yourself”
When you start your job/opportunity search, you need to be clear about your appetite for risk. What is your personality type (see #4)? With, for example, debts to pay off from your studies, are you someone who may be more comfortable with the stability, salary and benefits a large corporation can offer – not to mention the ability to climb the ladder? Or are you a risk-taker, comfortable with the fluidity and uncertainty that comes with founding or joining a startup, and taking a low salary alongside equity with the potential for enormous upside?
Understanding your tolerance for risk is fundamental for helping you navigate career decisions – whether that’s jumping on board an early-stage company, joining a Big Tech or legacy tech firm or indeed breaking into venture capital. The last thing you want is to be a year into your new journey and realize you made the wrong choice for reasons you could have predicted by doing your homework, ahead of taking the leap.
To minimize risk, I would go as far as to say that if you want to found your own startup, first go and join a company with momentum – and learn from them. However, if we start with the premise that you want to work for a technology company (venture-backed startup, scale-up or established corporate), begin by mapping out the tech landscape using a worksheet: on the x-axis you’ll cover categories such as ‘Geography’ (i.e. where a company’s based), ‘Industry sector’, ‘Upside/risk’ (i.e. your risk appetite), ‘Salary & stock’, ‘Company size’, ‘Culture’ (I always think of this as the company’s ‘blood type’ – either it matches with yours or it doesn’t), ‘Brand’ (joining a company with a strong brand will always open doors for you), ‘Momentum’, ‘Funding stage’ and so on, including how you would rate a company against your personal North Star. Then along the y-axis list the top VCs (ideally you want to join a company with strong investors) and pick the portfolio companies that are performing well that interest you – then cross-reference them with each category.
Now take that process a step further and write an investment memo (or offering memo) for, say, the three companies you most want to work for in the form of a pitch deck that provides a comprehensive overview and all the key metrics as if written for investors. Approach it as if you were making the case for investing your own money into this company. That will help you understand its value proposition and market position, and ensure you stand out as a candidate. When I invest in early-stage companies, I broadly look across four key themes: ‘Team’, ‘Product’, ‘Monetization’ and ‘Timing’. You can read more about that here. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, however, and typically VCs and angels have different methodologies. The one thing everyone can agree on though is that luck plays a big part in success.
VC is often seen as something you get into only if you want to become an investor. But there are actually three types of jobs in VC. The first and most obvious is indeed investing (see the image above), with roles ranging from General Partner to an entry-level Analyst. Next there’s the Platform team, covering Talent, Marketing, Sales & Business Development and so on. Finally, Operations encompasses fields such as Finance, Legal and Communications. Working in VC can mean working in any of them, and even if you want to become an investor, your entry point doesn’t need to be an investing role. Whether it’s an operational, finance, or a portfolio support role, getting your foot in the door is what matters. Once inside, opportunities will open up. If you do decide that nothing will stop you from becoming an investor, a great way to break in is to get experience as an angel investor or as a scout, build your contacts among startups, and bring VCs deal flow.
Once again, my strong suggestion here is that you map out the VC universe, detailing the key firms, partner profiles, where they are located, the categories they specialize in, their breakout portfolio companies, their own fund raises, their exits, etc. And then do a deep dive into what people – especially founders – say about them in media coverage and on social media, review sites such as Glassdoor, and then rate all of these against your personal North Star. Once you’ve narrowed your choices down to, say, half a dozen firms then track down alumni on LinkedIn and start building relationships. Read more from my former Partner at Balderton, Suranga Chandratillake here.
Arguably a lot of success comes from specialization and branding – pick an important niche that you love, focus on it and aim to be the best in that area. However, just as we often refer to the TAM (total addressable market) in venture capital, ensure your niche is large. This will always set you apart in competitive industries and focus your story and reputation. In my case, I became obsessed with large impact deal-making and business development – especially new types of deals that could be measured and patented. Filing patents always made me feel like a digital explorer. There are invariably jobs going at VC firms and technology companies, even if they are not advertised publicly. Being among the best in your field is your fast-track in.
If a company doesn’t align with your goals or values, or it isn’t taking you in the direction you want to go in – or you just feel stuck – do not hesitate to leave. Remember: you have two Olympic cycles to make an impact. Staying too long in the wrong environment or role can seriously hamper your career and personal growth, and it potentially hurts your employer. As Steve Jobs said in his 2005 Stanford commencement speech: “For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”
However, this isn’t about moving on as soon as you experience a bump or two in the road. Always remember we grow most facing adversity. Make sure you are patient and prioritize the right things. For example, don’t be dazzled by a job title, instead prioritize your co-workers, the value of the work you do and results you achieve, as a team. Remember: your colleagues are your strongest advocates. Similarly, always keep in mind what’s best for the company – which should be your North Star on the job. If you find that on too many occasions your personal North Star is not aligned with what’s best for your employer, then make adjustments or move on.
Many of the most successful entrepreneurs, investors and business leaders have faced multiple setbacks along the way. Failure, per se, doesn’t matter. Learning from your mistakes, rebounding and iterating quickly does. In a world of increasing technological change and shifting career paths, resilience is one of the most valuable skills you can develop. So don’t let fear of failure prevent you from taking risks, exploring new opportunities or pushing yourself far beyond your comfort zone.
I learned this firsthand when I was laid off from VoiceSignal. At the time, I didn’t understand why it had happened to me. It was disorienting, and I was left questioning my next steps. However, that unexpected event set off a chain reaction that would shape the rest of my career. It led me to join Dropbox, which then opened the door to joining Uber, and so on…
What seemed like a setback at the time propelled me on a path towards something even bigger. Later, I discovered that VoiceSignal had been mired in a lawsuit with Google, and that was the real reason for my layoff – something entirely out of my control. So take the big swings. If you fail, fail fast, learn, and keep going. Your biggest breakthroughs often come from your biggest challenges.
However always remember, a meal is only as good as the last bite. First impressions land the interview, but lasting impressions land your next dream job.

Commerce, finance, culture and.. yes, technology! The global technological industry’s centre of gravity gathers and evaluates the biggest chunk of the world’s data. For this reason, San Francisco, respectively Silicon Valley, has been one of the leading Global Experience locations with some of the highest numbers of interest and attendees.
George Berezhnov, who is part of the Sloan 2023 generation, described in more detail below his experience and the profound learnings and insights Silicon Valley offered.
Could you please tell us a little bit about your background and what were your motivations before you started the Sloan programme.
George: I have an academic background in artificial intelligence and an MBA from another business school. My career spans different functions and sectors, including healthcare and automotive. My speciality is driving innovation & new ventures in established organisations – I create strategies, partnerships and discovery systems that enable large companies to create new business models. Most recently, I established a strategic innovation unit at one of the world’s leading healthcare companies to reimagine the future of healthcare. It allowed us to change how we work and create a new pipeline of healthcare solutions, providing access to care to thousands of patients.
I decided to do Sloan because I was curious, I wanted to grow and challenge myself and I wanted to get to know myself better. For me, it was a rare opportunity to explore unfamiliar career paths at a mid-career stage and dive headfirst into a challenging and dynamic setting. Despite the risks involved, it offers a spectrum of experiences that, I believe, are key to discovering your best self and, most importantly, fostering incredible friendships that will last a lifetime.
What is the Global Experience, what location did you choose and why, and who was part of your group?
George: Global Experience is a signature experiential module at LBS, designed to broaden your horizons by exploring some of the world’s most vibrant cities. Each journey is themed around a key business concept such as corporate strategy, private equity, or digital innovation, for example, allowing students to delve into these areas in dynamic global contexts. It’s a chance to engage directly with leading organizations – big and small, gain new perspectives and forge international connections.
The global experience took me to Silicon Valley, aligning perfectly with my background in innovation, transformation, and AI. This destination was an obvious choice given its status as a leading tech hub and the disruption we are seeing in the AI space today. Our group comprised a diverse mix of EMBA and SLOAN participants, all sharing a keen interest in tech, innovation, and venture capital. This trek offered a deep dive into the region’s cutting-edge digital advancements. We engaged with a range of companies and thought leaders, exploring how AI is shaping business strategies and models. For me, the experience felt a little bit like witnessing the dawn of the internet – an excitement and a glimpse into the future of digital innovation. It also was highly practical as could engage with practitioners in the same field and discuss real-world case studies and evidence-based strategies.
How was the week structured?
George: Our week in Silicon Valley was a dynamic blend of company visits, VC panels, guest speakers, workshops, debates, and social events. The programme was designed to fully immerse us in Silicon Valley life and culture. We had the flexibility to personalize our journey, choosing to engage with organizations across various facets of digital innovation, including AI, cybersecurity, and data privacy. You also get a chance to learn about disruptive strategies from both established companies’ and start-ups’ perspectives. This comprehensive structure provided a holistic view of the venture capital scene, the current digital landscape and AI’s myriad challenges and opportunities. Finally, there’s always time to explore San Francisco and the area, we even visited one of the wineries and caught a beautiful sunset over Sonoma Valley.
What kind of events did you attend and what companies/ stakeholders did you interact with? Do you remember any key speakers that you met during the Global Experience?
George: The Global Experience module offered me the flexibility to design a personalized journey, enabling visits to a diverse array of organizations. This included industry giants such as Electronic Arts, pioneers like OpenAI, innovation hubs like Plug and Play, and several remarkable start-ups. A standout experience was my visit to AIXplain, an innovative start-up dedicated to democratizing AI development. There, founder Hassan Sawaf and his team provided deep dives into the life of an early-stage company, strategies for market entry, and tactics for outpacing competitors.
Equally memorable was our engagement with OpenAI, where discussions with Arka Dhar (Sloan Fellow) delved into the ethical considerations, risks, and expansive potential of generative AI technology. These discussions were enlightening, exploring the vast capabilities of AI, its biases and ethical implications in depth. Overall, my Global Experience encompassed a broad spectrum of topics, from the future of gaming and ethical dilemmas in AI to the intricacies of venture capital, creating a comprehensive and enriching learning and certainly a very memorable week.
What were the main takeaways from this memorable learning experience?
George: For me, the trip was an immersion into generative AI space and its potential as a powerful equalizer. This week opened perspectives on how such technologies can be applied at scale and enable a diverse range of individuals with varying backgrounds and abilities to engage in fields like research or coding, thus democratizing access to tech advancements and dramatically accelerating productivity across all functions and sectors. Another learning is that we are only scratching the surface – some of the early-stage projects we’ve seen are mind-blowing and we’ll certainly see the next generation of AI that will be even more powerful and accessible, now we need to understand how to use it responsibly and cope with the pace of transformation. Next, it broadened my toolkit in terms of managing digital disruption – we talked a lot about navigating risks, prioritising use cases, hiring talent and building solutions.
Finally, GE gave me a deeper understanding of how Silicon Valley serves as a global innovation and entrepreneurship epicentre. It is such a magnet for world-class talent, ideas, and capital. It thrives on a unique mix of a highly skilled workforce, a risk-taking culture, openness, strong academic institutions, and a robust investment ecosystem. However, it also faces significant challenges like ethical dilemmas that we still need to learn how to solve. This experience has broadened my perspective on Silicon Valley’s ecosystem and the ever-evolving nature of the digital landscape.
What advice would you have for the upcoming Sloan candidates?
George: First and foremost, if you have the chance to do it, absolutely seize the opportunity! Sloan is a truly unique programme with an exceptional, diverse cohort and distinguished faculty. You will find yourself in the company of remarkable people, from whom you will learn a great deal and with whom you are sure to become very good friends. It is an excellently designed program that encourages you to explore and think differently and my advice would be to embrace your authenticity, be curious and open-minded and use this time to embark on unfamiliar paths.

In this blog post, CROWC's Dr Fergus Bolger considers the possible consequences of increased automation in the workplace.
Growing pains
The rapid recent developments in AI have raised questions about the consequences for future employment (see, for example, reports from McKinsey, Forbes magazine, Deloitte and others). These reports suggest both winners and losers but, in contrast to most previous technological innovations, most disruption is expected amongst relatively high-paid knowledge workers such as data analysts and content creators.
However, there is a second technological revolution in the wings – advances in robotics could also have a profound impact on labour, and in this case the brunt of change is likely to fall on more traditional physical work, particularly in manufacturing.
Symbiosis
Of course, the ongoing generative AI revolution is linked with the putative robotics one – robots can do more things if they are smarter (e.g., autonomous drones on the battlefield) – so advances in AI, and computing more generally (e.g., edge computing), are drivers of advances in robotics.
Other drivers are technological developments in materials and engineering that could potentially transform robotics (e.g., battery innovations, artificial muscles, and new additive manufacturing techniques). Despite these drivers, most of the technology applied to robotics remains in the lab, with the majority of commercial robots showing only small advances in functionality from robots of the 1950s.
The Advance Research and Invention Agency (ARIA), established in 2022 by the UK government to fund “high-risk, high-reward” research, is hoping – through one of its first major programmes – to kickstart the robotics revolution in the UK by putting millions into moving new robot-relevant tech out of the lab. But to what end?
In the funding call for the current programme, the stated goal is to “release the bottlenecks in robotic dexterity and create vastly more capable and useful machines” that will lead to increased productivity at the same time as the number of able-bodied workers declines.
The stated belief underlying this goal is: “A world where robots free humanity from physical labour is not only possible... it is imperative if we wish to boost longevity and prosperity”. I think this belief needs examining in more detail.
Is this what we really want?
First, do we really want to “free humanity from physical labour”? There are well-established benefits to exercise for healthy minds and bodies. Also, many people enjoy working with their hands (e.g., the growth of “Maker Culture”).
So, perhaps we don't we want to eliminate physical labour altogether, just take the unpleasant parts out – this would imply robotics that are integrated with, and enhance, human activity (e.g., wearables, prosthetics, exoskeletons) rather than autonomous machines as is commonly envisaged. Thus, we need to consider what kind of physical labour is harmful, and which is not, and also, most of all, what people enjoy doing and what they do not.
Secondly, I question whether “prosperity” is the right goal here – yes, we want to boost productivity (i.e., improve efficiency of production) and, through this, quality of life, but do we really need more material wealth? Both productivity and well-being may be related to prosperity, but not necessarily. For example, increased productivity could mean we have the same stuff in less time, while increasing the amount of stuff we have has a marginally decreasing effect on well-being.
So, we need, as a society, to seriously consider what we want to maximise with robotics and other technological advances. AI and robotics seem to have great potential to add to human capabilities as well as to replace them, and I propose that we should concentrate our resources on the former rather than the latter.
Accepting ARIA’s premise that we need more robots, in addition to needing a clearer plan of what we want robots to do for us than ARIA seems to have, we also need to think about how we want to manage the robot revolution. For example, ARIA argues for ‘ubiquitous’ robots and, while recognising that to be ubiquitous, robots also need to be affordable, there is no mention of sustainability.
Ubiquitous robots implies using lots of resources to make them – where will these resources come from, and how will making robots impact other important goals such as reducing poverty and negative effects on climate and biodiversity? For example, will next-generation robots be competing with electric cars for minerals that may be unsustainably and/or exploitatively sourced?
Stopping to think
A robot revolution in the near-to-medium term seems probable, particularly given the efforts of agencies such as ARIA – already influential in the US through various advanced research project activities (ARPAs), and central to Mario Draghi’s recent blueprint for a more competitive EU.
Such a technological revolution, like others before it, will likely bring both costs and benefits to society. It seems to me that we have the opportunity to actively manage this particular revolution to maximise the societal benefits and minimise the costs.
As it currently stands, although not completely unprincipled, the strategy is incoherent. Pumping lots of public money into developments of technologies potentially useful for making ‘better’ robots will most likely lead to a transfer from the public coffers to the hands of tech companies and their bosses – and billionaires such as Bezos and Musk already have their fingers in the robot pie.

In this interview, Dr Lawrence Jones-Esan explains why he is an advocate of authentic assessment and explains the approach he has taken to introducing authentic assessment in Global Healthcare Management at YSJ London.
What is Authentic Assessment?
Lawrence explains that authentic assessment is a more practical approach to assessment: “Students are asked to perform tasks and demonstrate a meaningful application of essential knowledge and skills”, ready for life after university. He references John Mueller’s work to describe authentic assessment as a type of vocational learning that “bridges the gap between theory and practice”. The idea is that these assessments include a task for students to perform, allowing teachers to assess what the student can do, as opposed to merely assessing how much information the student can recall. Example tasks could be giving a presentation, creating an information sheet or conducting an experiment. For Lawrence, anything practical that utilises knowledge for a greater purpose is an authentic way of assessing students.
Authentic Assessment in Practice
Lawrence explains that he, together with colleagues, set an assignment in which they “asked students to develop a breast cancer research project where they had to learn about cancer, go out and raise funds, interview cancer patients, and see how they [could] work towards the [early] identification of breast cancer.” Students would have to consider how to use and share their knowledge suitably for the target audience and encourage people to self-check and attend scheduled tests. As Lawrence reports, with this approach, students would not only have to learn about the issue, but would also need to find ways to apply their knowledge towards a purpose: increasing awareness of how to spot the early stages of breast cancer and of where people can go for support. Through the assessment, students develop skills in relation to fundraising, working with external organisations like the NHS to gather information, and interviewing patients. Lawrence now hopes to extend this model of assessment to include other medical issues – for example, prostate cancer.
The Benefits of Authentic Assessment
Lawrence shared his reasons behind championing authentic assessment. The key benefits he reports are:
- They can mitigate against the use of GenAI in written submissions: The practicality of the types of assessment Lawrence describes is difficult to replicate using GenAI. Even if GenAI was used to write up the assignment, the progress the student makes comes entirely from their practical experiences, which cannot be replicated with a computer. He says that GenAI becomes completely insufficient as a means for writing such assessments as “there has to be some correlation between the work and its presentation”.
- It enables students to appreciate their personal progress: As Lawrence explains, the way that authentic assessment bridges the gap between theory and practice “exposes all the processes that the students went through to achieve their goal”, thus providing them with an opportunity to reflect and build confidence in their skills.
- Students develop transferable skills: Authentic assessment bolsters student readiness for the world beyond university as they learn how to utilise their knowledge, gaining experience of critical thinking and project management, as well as having opportunities to present their ideas for critical feedback.
- It gives their work purpose: With Lawrence’s model, students develop ideas that can be used to help others. In the example of the breast cancer activity above, the assessment helped people to identify cancer, spreading awareness of the importance of knowing the signs. In addition, students were able to raise funds for the cause. Students are able to get excited about their work, developing a passion for making a difference. Lawrence is a firm believer that these opportunities mean that students are bound to put more effort into their work, leading to better assessment outcomes.
- Such experience is great for job applications: Students can use their university work as evidence of their capacity to fulfil certain roles in the workplace. Lawrence explains that being given the chance to utilise knowledge to create something beneficial for society is a great way to improve student employability, making students more ready for the world of work.
Challenges, Adjustments and Recommendations
There are, of course, some challenges where authentic assessment is concerned, which must be taken into consideration when developing new tasks. Lawrence gives his thoughts on these below.
- Students may struggle to adjust: Lawrence notes that many students are used to the traditional assessment formats of essays and exams – particularly the international students with whom he works predominantly. However, with the traditional mode, there is no emphasis on meaning or use for an assignment once it’s over. He argues that many students feel, therefore, that they can forget about their work once it is complete. So, he believes the adjustment to a new mode of working is worth it.
- Making accommodations for students’ needs: Related to the previous point, Lawrence explains that students do not always have the skills to complete redesigned assessments – for instance, they may not know how to create a digital poster. He has overcome this limitation by putting on additional workshops to develop students’ skills. This can be tough and time-consuming, but it is rewarding, as again, it is an opportunity for students to gain authentic, transferable skills.
Conclusion
For Lawrence, the benefits of authentic assessment absolutely outweigh the drawbacks. While the examples he gives are specific to his subject area, he believes there are many possibilities for creating similar approaches within different disciplines. The core principle lies in adding meaning and practical applications to every assignment. Even with traditional assessment types like essays, you can create a broader use – for example, work could be published or shared for other students’ or researchers’ benefit. Similarly, leaflets, posters and presentations can be added to assessment requirements and used to reach a particular target audience either within or beyond the university.
Lawrence emphasises that he has received a lot of positive feedback from students since implementing authentic assessment strategies, and has also noticed a marked improvement in students’ assignment results. Due to his and his colleagues’ successes, authentic assessment is now being rolled out more broadly across the YSJ London campus. He hopes that use of such forms of assessment will continue expand both at YSJ and across the sector.

Research Interests
Nestor's research delves into two areas. The first has a focus on cultural ecologies, particularly in relation to bats, their cultural associations and narrative portrayals in cinema and literature. The second deals with the exploration of historical archives in combination with AI technologies, to investigate possible human-machine collaborations in the production of stories, and explore inherent opportunities and ethical challenges.
Through his explorations, he engages in collaborations with scientists and technologists to promote knowledge exchange, critical thinking and lifelong learning. Projects are research based, focusing on the increasing necessity for critical engagement with contemporary and emerging issues related to ecology and technology. To facilitate this Nestor uses worldbuilding and speculative design methods and frameworks. Narratives are expressed through moving image, illustration and prop/object design, to create multimedia installations aiming at involving visitors actively and critically with the narrative and issue presented.
Practice
In parallel to teaching and research, Nestor is a practicing multimedia artist, working in the intersection between digital and physical materiality. His artistic practice incorporates digital fabrication technologies such as 3D printing and CNC, combined with digital animation, film, sound, and interactive media. He is also a digital designer, specialising in UX/UI and digital animation, and has experience working as a design researcher, employing collaborative worldbuilding methods for future thinking. Organisations that he has worked with include Superflux, IKEA, King’s College London and Science Gallery London.

Current and Recent Projects
The Bats Project: New Dark Aesthetics
2022 (ongoing)
Bats are keystone and indicator species. They regulate insect populations and offer valuable insights into ecosystem health. Despite their ecological benefits, bats are often socially stigmatised, partly due to their nocturnal habits and storytelling portrayals.
The Bats Project delves into the intricacies of the climate crisis, cultural ecologies and aesthetics. It aims to explore and disseminate a deeper understanding of bats, shifting current negative perceptions, contributing to the development of positive dark aesthetics and stories akin to their nocturnal habits.
Arquivista AI
2021 (ongoing)
This project delves into the overlaps between archives and the complex virtuous and vicious cycles of AI technologies, such as GPT. Such technological innovations allow us to immediately access vast amounts of information, and enable rapid explorations across diverse subjects, revolutionising the way we gather knowledge. However, the reliance on these technologies also raises ethical concerns, emphasising the need for responsible integration to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the information obtained.
Arquivista AI is a research platform of sorts that creatively explores the relationships between gaps in historical knowledge and artificial intelligence. Through archival research, historical gaps are identified and filled in with possible histories, deliriums and glitches generated by artificial intelligence. This process allows for the exploration of new storytelling methods in collaboration with AI and creates opportunities to imagine how different our present lives could be by tweaking past events.

Location: TheGallery, AUB Campus; and in a virtual exhibition space
TheGallery, The Library, and the Innovation Studio working in partnership with the Schools of Arts, Media, and Creative Industries Management, Arts and Communications, and Design and Architecture, Graduate School, and AUB Outreach and Alumni Office, present Design; Disruption; Divergence – an exhibition that looks at how Generative AI is impacting on artists’ practice.
This exhibition and the associated events explore identity politics in digital representation and creative AI, contributing to important and current conversations around, authenticity, diversity, and ownership in digital spaces.
Overview
Design; Disruption; Divergence opens the door to the evolving relationship between imagination and innovation. This exhibition doesn’t just showcase what AI can make – it interrogates what AI means for the act of making itself. In a time when algorithms are part of our everyday world, this is all about how AI collaborates with human imagination. From hyperreal avatars to surreal designs that dissolve the line between the real and the virtual, you’ll discover the many ways AI can be utilised in creative practice. AI emerges here as more than just an assistant; it’s a mirror reflecting our hopes and anxieties about the future of creativity in the digital age. These works illustrate AUB’s proactive engagement with AI and its impact on creative industries, underscoring the need for human guidance and design thinking in shaping its role in artistic practice.
Artists across the UK are finding new uses for AI, inspiring works ranging from uncanny AI kittens at Somerset House to deepfake drag cabarets at the V&A. This exhibition builds on these advancements, showcasing how AI-assisted art is reshaping cultural discussions and redefining what's conceivable in artistic practice. However, alongside this are deeper questions about the ethical, environmental, and social perils of these tools. We must foster a realistic understanding of the limitations and risks of AI. So, while looking at these works, we also invite the question: What does this technology cost us?
So, wander through the fragmented realities, let yourself be drawn into alternate histories, and confront impossible futures. But most importantly, ask questions. This exhibition is as much about discovery as it is about dialogue – between humans, machines, and the possibilities yet to come.
This exhibition can also be viewed from the comfort of your own home, school, or college via a VR headset in our virtual exhibition space.

When I first signed up for the Breakthrough Technologies Global Experience in Austin, I expected robots, self-driving cars, and maybe a dramatic Elon Musk cameo. While that didn’t happen (I wish!), what I did get was even better: a deep understanding of how finance and innovation are no longer operating separately. They’re colliding, converging, and co-creating the future.
Austin, often dubbed Silicon Valley’s cooler cousin, is a city where deep tech, weird ideas, and world-changing companies flourish against a backdrop of live music and Tex-Mex.
But before we dive into 3D-printed houses and rocket-building startups, let’s ask the obvious: what exactly is a breakthrough technology?
What Even is a Breakthrough?
At first, breakthrough technology felt like one of those buzzwords you hear in tech blogs and VC decks. But on the very first day of our GE in Austin, I learned it’s much more than that. It’s not just about improvement, it’s about transformation.
Some breakthroughs are born from years of meticulous R&D. Google’s moonshot projects are textbook examples. Others happen almost by accident. Think Alexander Fleming discovering penicillin, or Donald Stookey overheating glass to 900°C and inventing Chemcor, which eventually became Gorilla Glass for iPhones. The formula? Deep expertise, insatiable curiosity, and sometimes a Petri dish left out a little too long.
Why Finance Needs to Care?
The real challenge, though, isn’t just coming up with big ideas. It’s scaling them. This is where the “Valley of Death” comes in. It’s that painful stage between invention and commercialisation where many promising technologies die out. Not because they’re bad ideas, but because the capital risk is too high and the path to profitability too uncertain.
That’s when finance steps in, not just as a funder but as an enabler of innovation. The future of finance depends on our ability to assess risk based not only on historical data but on what might be possible.
The Austin Experience
Over a packed week, we got a front-row seat to how innovation looks in real life. From sleek mobility startups to old-school giants pushing boundaries, the variety was eye-opening.
I still remember how our group collectively geeked out when we matched with a Waymo as our Uber during a commute. Yes, Waymo, Google’s self-driving car. It wasn’t just the futuristic tech that impressed us, but the questions it raised: if cars can drive themselves, what happens to car loans, auto insurance, traffic fines, even personal injury law? Suddenly, every part of the financial system looks different and as future leaders in finance, we’ll need to understand them better than ever.
Our company visits in Austin did just that for us. At Siemens, we discovered how this 175-year-old giant is quietly revolutionising everything from high-speed rail (they built the Eurostar e320!) to smart factory automation, and even working with Pfizer and RedBull Racing.
Firefly Aerospace, with its mission to make space more accessible using lightweight launch vehicles and reusable rocket engines, showed us the high-stakes world of space tech. Capital Factory, Austin’s buzzing startup incubator, demonstrated how essential early-stage finance is in turning ideas into impact. These sessions made it clear: innovation may start with a big idea, but it only scales with the right capital, timing, and partnerships, and understanding that balance is where finance becomes a true catalyst for the future.
Why LBS is the Perfect Launchpad
This trip didn’t just make me think differently. It made me appreciate how London Business School has been preparing us all along to think at that intersection of finance and innovation.
At LBS, we’re encouraged not just to understand markets but to challenge them. Whether it’s through finance, strategy, or entrepreneurship modules, the learning goes beyond textbook models and digs into real-world uncertainty.
Electives like Generative Artificial Intelligence, Innovation and Technology Strategy, and Digital for Impact dive deep into these intersections. Add to that the student-led Tech & Media Club, Entrepreneurship Club, and our startup incubator at the Institute of Entrepreneurship and Private Capital, and you’ve got a campus that doesn’t just talk about innovation but lives it.
Final Thoughts
The Global Experience in Austin reaffirmed what I suspected all along: the future of finance won’t just be about numbers. It’ll be about imagination, timing, and conviction. It’ll be about those brave enough to bet on a sketchy-looking prototype today because they see a billion-dollar market tomorrow.",2333,,London Business School,20.2,,2125,2333,london.edu,,0:00,,,United Kingdom,media,4.54966405912443,0.6331034482758621,751,False,2333,"A Global Experience week in Austin: How Finance Powers… – Student and Admissions Blog - London Business School

Saul Klein, a leading venture capitalist, joins Gary Dushnitsky, Associate Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship at London Business School, to explore London’s rise as a global tech powerhouse. Klein reflects on the evolution of the UK’s innovation ecosystem over the past two decades, positioning London as the ""New Palo Alto"" and highlighting its distinctive approach to values-driven entrepreneurship.
The discussion touches on key growth sectors such as AI, biotech, and fintech, as well as the importance of talent diversity and pro-innovation regulation in shaping London’s future.
Michael G Jacobides, Sir Donald Gordon Professor of Entrepreneurship and Innovation; Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship at London Business School, and Yuri Romanenkov, Academic Director of Next Generation Digital Strategy, London Business School delve into the transformative impact of generative AI (genAI) on industries and private equity.
Professor Ilya A Strebulaev shares insights about his research on Corporate Venture Capital in conversation with Gary Dushnitsky at the Private Capital Symposium 2022 hosted by the Institute of Entrepreneurship and Private Capital at LBS.
Are venture capitalists just good at picking companies that will ultimately be successful? Or do they actually help them become successful through their value-added work.

Should this response be signalling caution to the rest of the world, or is ChatGPT just another exciting new tool for organisations to exploit?
Technology brings innovation, speeding up and simplifying complex activities for the user, but the ethical implications are often an afterthought. ChatGPT is the latest manifestation of an accelerating digital transformation that can feel at times both uncontrolled and alarming. In this article we will demystify some of the hype and identify the ethical concerns that ChatGPT should be flagging for organisations.
What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot. It is designed to hold a conversation in a natural way and it can complete language-based tasks, such as answering a question or writing an article, poem or song. The technology works by taking ‘large language models’ that utilise huge data sets to generate natural language using a ‘Generative Pretrained Transformer’ (GPT) process.
GPT technology was created by OpenAI, a USA-based research company founded in 2015 by Elon Musk (owner of Tesla and Twitter) and a cohort of other tech leaders with a strong pedigree in the digital space:
- Sam Altman (Y Combinator, a venture capital firm),
- Greg Brockman (Stripe payment processing),
- Dr Ilya Sutskever (Google Brain),
- Dr John Schulman,
- Dr Wojciech Zaremba (NVIDIA graphics firm, Google Brain, Facebook AI).
Musk left in 2018 to focus on his other businesses[1] and in the same year OpenAI published a paper on their original GPT. The launch of ChatGPT in 2023 is the most recent and most sophisticated iteration of the technology.
AI and machine learning
AI has been in our lives for years and we’re already using it in many settings:
- At home: When you ask Siri, Alexa or Bixby about the weather, the name of that celebrity that you can’t remember, or to play music, the response is based on AI.
- At work: Gmail and Outlook complete sentences for you as you start to create or respond to an email.
- On the road: With satnav your car learns and adapts to your preferred routes.
- In healthcare: Thousands of MRI images are assessed every day by AI applications that offer a fast and cost-effective diagnostic solution[2].
In these examples, the machines are learning based on your feedback which is a core part of AI. The machine – your voice assistant, email client, satnav or MRI scanner - gathers and analyses data, and from this it can generate responses, which is why it’s described as ‘generative’.
Feedback is given to the machines when you rephrase the question for your voice assistant or say it’s wrong, you ignore or correct the predictive text, you ignore the satnav directions or request alternatives, or when physicians check the scans and note the image interpretation as being accurate or not.
Why is ChatGPT different?
You may wonder if ChatGPT is different. The real answer is that it’s not.
All the tech companies are working on GPT products with systems that are trained on large data sets, and the chat variations are trained on large language models. Google’s Bard is competing in the same marketplace as ChatGPT, albeit somewhat less successfully at present, and Microsoft has invested in OpenAI to power its search engine Bing.
All languages have structures; our sentences follow an order (grammar), some words are written in a formal style, some are spoken in a conversational style. These are easy to replicate using existing tools such as dictionaries, thesaurus and grammar guides. The GPT systems are programmed using these tools as data, but they are also constantly learning from the feedback users provide.
We’ve been using large language models for years. For example Grammarly, the plug-in writing checker, is based on AI and gains big data from its 30 million users which means it is constantly learning and updating options to improve grammar, punctuation and spelling¹.
In the same way, users might provide ChatGPT with a scenario such as ‘Write an essay for me on market segmentation’, and a response is generated based on the available data. If you don’t like the response you ask the GPT to revise its content, and this feedback provides learning points and contributes to the ever-growing dataset.
Why are we worried about ChatGPT?
These examples of machine learning are a type of AI known as unsupervised learning. The machines check their rules (algorithms) and launch without the need for human supervision. This is leading to concerns about:
- Who is checking the material;
- The type of material produced;
- How this may impact content creators or authors;
- Issues with copyright and plagiarism;
- Accuracy of the machine-generated content.
Many users have reported that the ChatGPT responses are ‘vanilla’; they lack depth and detail, and the context may be missing too. In time the language models will learn, but at present they generate content rather than creating it by stealing material from other people’s contributions (whether from within the GPT system or from other online sources) without providing any new ideas about the content.
To create content requires different skills. You need to know the audience, their location, education level and the real purpose of the material. The singer-songwriter Nick Cave understandably responded acerbically to a fan who asked ChatGPT to create a song ‘written in the style of Nick Cave’[3]. The system may have generated the song, but it lacks the passion, feeling and meaning embedded in the creative mind. Songwriters often have a thread running through several songs that represents genuine human emotions. The machines can’t yet produce this.
In many instances, the material generated is also inaccurate. Worryingly, as Tim Harford writing in the Financial Times[4] observed, the content seems realistic and has a degree of plausibility, even though it’s not accurate.
In an academic setting, going back to our example ‘Write an essay for me on market segmentation’, ChatGPT may provide a basic overview. But for students it won’t support the notion of critical thinking; deeply considering a subject, reviewing its meaning, conducting research and formulating a response supported with relevant and reliable evidence. When asked to support the arguments with references, ChatGPT will refine the essay and provide a range of outdated texts (segmentation has moved on a lot in the last 10 years), which raises further questions about whether the platform owner is paying for, or circumnavigating, access to the materials cited.
A bigger issue is that because the material seems credible, it could become a major channel of disinformation, where users believe the content produced is valid. It’s easy to add incorrect material online which could then be incorporated into a ChatGPT response. Think about the singer-songwriter James Blunt, who edited his own Wiki page to say he had played the organ at a royal wedding; it was totally untrue but believed by many[5]. This serves as an example of online disinformation and highlights the issue that a source-checking facility is not yet available in GPTs.
Why organisations should create policy
The race to adopt ChatGPT demonstrated the ‘bandwagon effect’ as organisations rushed to trial and explore how the system could save time and money. Yet they failed to consider the strategic implications of these actions. If the product is free, you are the product. So organisations freely gave away their thoughts, ideas and plans. Imagine two advertising agencies are bidding for a pitch with a client; they both use ChatGPT and the best-case scenario is that they present each other’s ideas, or worse-case – the same material.
There are other big issues to consider, including the notion of bias in the material. GPTs could perpetuate hate-speech or generate biased content that impacts different groups. It could be misused with significant material being added which is inappropriate. While this could be programmed out, you will know from any spam email you’ve ever received that there are ways around this, with hundreds of variations on words that you think are blocked, such as Viagra (e.g. V1agra, Vi@gra, V1*gra).
Security is another concern. As ChatGPT rushed to release its latest version, they missed some security processes, resulting in a data breach where ‘due to a bug in an open-source library which allowed some users to see titles from another active user’s chat history. It’s also possible that the first message of a newly-created conversation was visible in someone else’s chat history if both users were active around the same time.’[6] So that’s all your confidential thoughts being shared with other people.
Google’s GPT version is known as Bard[7], which it describes as :
Meet Bard: your creative and helpful collaborator, here to supercharge your imagination, boost your productivity, and bring your ideas to life.
Bard is an experiment and may give inaccurate or inappropriate responses. You can help make Bard better by leaving feedback.
There have been widely reported ethical concerns about releasing Bard too early, but in the land grab to get into the GPT space, Google has gone ahead and launched the system. Yet releasing software before it’s ready always means that it includes bugs. The users are then the beta testers, flagging issues as they arise.
Ethical considerations for organisations
The key questions organisations need to ask themselves are:
- What procedures are in place to avoid biased or inaccurate material being generated?
- If they secure products or services with intellectual property (IP) legislation, are they protected when using online third-party systems like ChatGPT?
- How can they avoid plagiarising or stealing other people’s work and fall foul of IP legislation?
- Are they happy to give confidential information to a machine that can share it with others who ask that question?
- What governance is in place to ensure staff creating client material don’t opt for the fast ChatGPT approach which could result in embarrassment or lost clients?
As tech heavyweights including Elon Musk publicly acknowledge their concerns about AI, whilst the systems continue to develop and evolve, we will need stronger ethical codes to ensure we understand the impact of their use and protect against misuse.

From the facial recognition technology used to blur the background in portrait photos taken on our phones, to predictive messaging, autonomous vacuum cleaners and music recommendations, not to mention the recent advancements and uptake of large language model (LLM) technologies, such as ChatGPT.
Soon we will start to see AI integrated more into automation and robotic systems, with a particular use case for this being in manufacturing or supply chain management. But, as governments, organisations, and individuals, are we prepared for this innovative technology and how can we ensure that it is designed, developed, deployed and used in the right way?
Beyond efficiency: the human cost of algorithmic bias
In 2015, Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), discovered that facial recognition technologies tended to perform less well on females with darker skin colour (BBC News, 2017). This was due to the training set that had been used to create the facial recognition technologies predominantly only containing data about white males: the AI had developed its model of ‘a face’ based upon the data it had been presented with, which happened to be predominantly white males.
At the time, this illustrated a major issue with AI technologies, giving rise to the term ‘AI bias’, referring to the issue whereby AI decision-making systems display prejudice towards/against a certain demographic, usually due to the training data involved in the creation of the AI model being unrepresentative of its user group. AI bias has been shown to be present in AI systems making decisions about whom to give a job, whom to give a loan, and even in physical autonomous systems such as driverless cars that are dependent upon AI decision-making.
Human-centred AI: designing for ethical and inclusive outcomes
Such issues made AI ethics a driving imperative, with various institutions and bodies being established to look at topics such as bias, privacy, transparency and fairness when AI systems are being designed and implemented. However, with the introduction of AI into sectors such as manufacturing and supply chains, where it is being used alongside automation and robotics, we have a new ethical paradigm whereby we not only have to be conscious of the ethical risks surrounding the AI software, but new risks arising from its physical embodiment.
For instance, how does bias impact a physical system that is reliant upon AI for its decision-making, and how can we mitigate these risks? How can we ensure that these new physical autonomous systems are being used in the right way, and in the context of manufacturing and supply chains, that their implementation complements the needs of the human workforce, as opposed to increasing risk or making interesting jobs redundant?
There are significant ethical considerations and assessments that must be addressed as AI and physical autonomous systems are embedded even more into our lives, and we all have some responsibility for having awareness for what these are. At a government level, we need to assess what regulatory frameworks are needed to ensure that the operation of physical autonomous systems sits in line with safety standards and that they are used fairly, without discrimination. Organisations need to ensure that the newly embedded physical autonomous systems are equitable for all stakeholders, in particular, employees and broader society. At an individual level, we need to be aware of the limitations of such technologies and be cognisant of the ethical risks, to challenge those developing and commissioning the technologies to do so in a way that is conducive to everyone.
Questions for leaders
Given the complexity of the ethical landscape when it comes to AI and physical autonomous systems, how can leaders whose operations, functions or organisations adopt these technologies ensure best practice in this area? Rather than prescribing static answers, we suggest asking yourselves the following questions, and reflecting on the implications on your own practice.
1. How does my organisation currently address the ethical implications presented by these technologies?
2. What new governance frameworks could my organisation develop to best incorporate embodied artificial intelligences, such that ethical considerations are appropriately addressed?
3. How can I further educate myself, my teams and my peers about ethics in Artificial Intelligence?

By the end of the session, you'll leave equipped with practical skills and creative strategies to empower students through immersive learning.
3. Incorporating AI in assessment
Final year students in the School of Psychology were required to use ChatGPT to prepare two assignments. This session describes the experience of this form of assessment from teacher and student perspectives, and considers the implications for future living with generative AI in higher education settings.
4. Engagement. What do we mean?
This session will seek to explore and problematise the term student engagement. We will set the context through a case study (PG Cert Teaching in HE), then we'll collectively define what engagement means, and share suggestions for improving student engagement.
5. Cracking the Code: Personalised Learning Powered by Collective & Artificial Intelligence
A presentation that introduces the future of education. The Modern Method of Education is conceptual educational theory where international cross-institution collaboration breaks down barriers and builds curricula and knowledge from culturally diverse perspectives. Through the use of innovative technology, collective teaching and learning enables diversity of thought empowering students to embark on a fully personalised journey of lifelong learning.
6. Why are they so happy? Reflecting on excellent MES results in Children’s Book Illustration
In tri 1 of 23/24 the module Illustration and Audience: The Paradox scored some of the best MES results in the university. After reviewing the MES feedback, an informal critical reflection of the approach to teaching was conducted to identify how these results were achieved. This suggested that they were due to the positive effects of establishing a strong studio culture, which allows for regular staff-student interaction, a collaborative group mentality, good communication and a balance between independent working and structured activities.
7. In at the Deep End: Education for Sustainability as an immersive experiential learning experience
Education for sustainability is holistic and transformational learning, engaging the head, heart and mind of learners. It addresses the ways in which learners think, the ways in which they do things and the ways they feel. In this presentation we provide some examples of the learning which took place as a group of staff and students took a deep experiential dive into the complexities of sustainable development as part of ARU’s International Community Experience Programme Sustainable Sainji.
8. Celebrating Live Briefs and identifying next steps
Live Briefs are a curriculum-based approach to engage students in a form of professional development by assessing their learning using current, real-world activities devised and presented by employer partners in collaboration with academic staff. We celebrate the work of academic colleagues who will share examples of good practice from Live Briefs they have taught. We will also introduce interdisciplinary Live Briefs which will facilitate students from different disciplines to collaborate on a work-integrated learning project. Attendees will be able to share their own ideas for interdisciplinary Live Briefs through a collaborative activity making Live Brief representations using Playmobil.
9. 360° Thrive: Mastering Video Creation & Integration for Dynamic Learning
Embark on an exhilarating journey of immersive learning at Engage! In this electrifying 30-minute session, we'll unlock the secrets of creating and editing captivating 360-degree videos using cutting-edge technology. Dive into the world of 360 cameras as we demonstrate how to capture the essence of any environment in stunning detail. Learn the art of storytelling through dynamic editing techniques that bring your videos to life. But that's not all – we'll show you how to seamlessly upload your masterpiece to Yuja for effortless integration into Canvas, revolutionising the way you engage learners. Get ready to unleash your creativity and transform education like never before!
10. Celebrating widening participation: how can we encourage equity in education?
Widening participation in higher education is something to be celebrated, but how can we best meet the needs of a non-traditional student body? Join us for an interactive workshop where we will explore student needs and barriers to success. By sharing experiences from ARU London’s diverse student body, and identifying actions that improved their student journeys, we will celebrate the resilience of our students and examine how our academic community can encourage equity in education.
11. Embedding Employability in the Curriculum
Both speakers are involved in sabbatical projects related to employability. Shell is an RA on a project led by Sebastian Rasinger evaluating extra-curricular activities with external partners, and Sarah is exploring ways of embedding employability in the curriculum. In this session we will briefly introduce some of our key findings. We will be asking participants to reflect on some of the barriers to students taking up internships and similar opportunities – and on strategies to address these barriers. We will then be inviting participants to try out a classroom activity designed to embed employability into a Level 4 English Literature module.
12. Celebrating your Research - how the Public Engagement Team can support you
The Public Engagement Team exists to facilitate many forms of engagement with the public. This includes but is not limited to:
- Running and promoting events such as the Cambridge Festival, Inaugural Lectures and Chelmsford Science Festival
- Supporting and advising academic colleagues who are running their own events
- Working with local community groups
We would like the opportunity to give an overview of the ways we can help to celebrate and communicate the research of our academic colleagues to the public.
13. ""My culture, your culture, our story"" - keeping EDI learning active for 500+ students online using peer learning
Learning about EDI and practising inclusively is essential for students in HeMS who are taking professional courses. This has traditionally been delivered online to over 500 students. As our students are themselves from a diverse range of backgrounds, we introduced peer learning in break out rooms for one hour during an Interprofessional Learning day. ""My Culture, Your Culture, Our Story"" celebrates differences, with active sharing of experience between peers and some sessions led by students. Impact has included greater understanding of peers as well as transferable knowledge for practice. Students said ""lively, fun, interactive, informative, educative"".
14. How you can create an interprofessional learning opportunity to increase student satisfaction
In response to the action following the last NSS (child nursing) outcomes, where the student voice scored 63%, especially relating to ‘staff have made the subject interesting’, we organised and delivered an innovative co-curricular activity. Listening to feedback from students who felt their child nursing identity is not clear within the course, the focus was ‘What happens after the death of a child’. We worked in collaboration with the medical school/ anatomy suite and external speakers. This day promoted interprofessional learning, aimed to provide a link to ‘real world’ practices for students and showcased a successful partnership within ARU and external agencies.
15. ""You Can Auto-mate!"" community
Introducing the ""You Can Auto-Mate!"" community, bringing together everyone in ARU - staff and students, to harness the power of technology to make daily work-related tasks easier. A community where the experts, amateurs and novices around the university can share best practices, ideas for simple automation and help each other where needed.
16. Supporting students' professional development and engagement with ARUCPD
The Faculty of Business and Law introduces ARUCPD, an innovative co-curricular programme designed to support students’ professional development. Accredited by ARU, not only enhances students' transcripts but also equips students with knowledge and skills essential for today's and future workplace.
ARUCPD's impact on employability and student engagement is undeniable and has been recognised internally and externally. With over 2500 participants in the first two trimesters of 2023/2024 alone, ARUCPD is attracting interest from students and staff across all Faculties at ARU.
Our workshop will explain the ARUCPD's framework and guide participants in designing their own student-focused professional development modules. The activity will also foster dialogue on how these modules can potentially be integrated within the ARUCPD programme in the future.
17. Empowering Your Students through Digital Fluency
Developing your student’s digital fluency will help them to engage in their learning and will develop their employability as an outcome of their learning experience. Using the Developing Digital Fluency Workbook, the session we give you space to develop approaches for integrating digital experiences into your teaching to foster fluency. The workshop will also introduce the researched-informed approach being taken by the project team as we work with employers, academics, students, and other universities to develop our understanding of digital fluency and its critical importance to student success.
18. Decolonising and diversifying STEM education: Insights from the Unlearning Away Days
Decolonising and diversifying higher education is a concept and movement aimed at rectifying historical biases, ongoing inequalities, and prevalence of Eurocentric perspectives within the sector. Its overarching objective is to cultivate a more inclusive, diverse, and equitable higher education landscape by challenging established paradigms. In this workshop, we will provide a forum for debate on decolonisation or diversification followed by reflections on what we learnt from the Race Equality Away Day offered in the school level in two different faculties (HEMs and FSE). These events were used to explore structural racism using relevant data for each School, followed by interactive presentations. This presentation includes some key learning points and reflections from our Race Equality Away Days to share good practices, stimulate thinking with peers across ARU and connect people to support continuation with work on enhancing inclusive practices.
19. International Cultural Competence
Research (Aisha, and Mulyana, 2020; Dagus, et al., 2024; Garside et al., 2023; Safari, McKenna, and Davis, 2022.) has shown that International students from different countries experience almost the same communication issues and culture shock. There is also a concerning mismatch between their expectations and experience in the UK. Evidence (Gopal et al., 2023; Noltensmeyer, Bloom, and Rush, 2024) has also highlighted the importance of preparing lecturers to facilitate adequate adaptation through cultural awareness, knowledge, and sensitivity. This interactive session is meant to raise awareness about cultural understanding and elements contributing to culture shock experienced by international students and highlight some strategies for coping mechanisms.
20. Our students' favourite learning experiences
The ARU Active Learning Network gathered case studies from ARU students to find out their favourite learning experiences, in the form of videos, written pieces and more.
21. Approaches to drive student engagement and success through innovative, inclusive, and impactful bespoke interventions: The development of the Centre for Student Success at Anglia Ruskin University
Established in 2023, the Centre for Student Success (CfSS) in the Faculty of Business and Law aims to improve student engagement, success rates, and inclusivity. Collaborating with different stakeholders across the faculty, the CfSS developed a method of targeted interventions at specific points of the academic cycle: students’ registration, weekly engagement, and the enhancement of personal development tutoring (PDT). Student engagement, whether online or on campus, was monitored weekly, and students were directed to the most appropriate support based on their circumstances. The CfSS monitored data and measured the impact of the interventions, and these findings will be presented to serve as guidance for other institutions to adopt.
22. Impact achieved and future prospects: an overview of FSE ""Succeeding"" 2024
""Succeeding"" 2024 was the inaugural employability and careers event for Science and Engineering students. Attendees will gain insights into the event’s impact on student engagement and employability, and can use this knowledge to organise similar career-enhancing initiatives in their own contexts.",2659,,Writtle University College,7.5,,675,2659,aru.ac.uk,,0:00,,,United Kingdom,"events, media",4.628486096170333,0.4366679345758844,2584,False,2659,"Annual Conference 2024 - ARU

In this session we will briefly introduce some of our key findings. We will be asking participants to reflect on some of the barriers to students taking up internships and similar opportunities – and on strategies to address these barriers. We will then be inviting participants to try out a classroom activity designed to embed employability into a Level 4 English Literature module.
12. Celebrating your Research - how the Public Engagement Team can support you
The Public Engagement Team exists to facilitate many forms of engagement with the public. This includes but is not limited to:
- Running and promoting events such as the Cambridge Festival, Inaugural Lectures and Chelmsford Science Festival
- Supporting and advising academic colleagues who are running their own events
- Working with local community groups
We would like the opportunity to give an overview of the ways we can help to celebrate and communicate the research of our academic colleagues to the public.
13. ""My culture, your culture, our story"" - keeping EDI learning active for 500+ students online using peer learning
Learning about EDI and practising inclusively is essential for students in HeMS who are taking professional courses. This has traditionally been delivered online to over 500 students. As our students are themselves from a diverse range of backgrounds, we introduced peer learning in break out rooms for one hour during an Interprofessional Learning day. ""My Culture, Your Culture, Our Story"" celebrates differences, with active sharing of experience between peers and some sessions led by students. Impact has included greater understanding of peers as well as transferable knowledge for practice. Students said ""lively, fun, interactive, informative, educative"".
14. How you can create an interprofessional learning opportunity to increase student satisfaction
In response to the action following the last NSS (child nursing) outcomes, where the student voice scored 63%, especially relating to ‘staff have made the subject interesting’, we organised and delivered an innovative co-curricular activity. Listening to feedback from students who felt their child nursing identity is not clear within the course, the focus was ‘What happens after the death of a child’. We worked in collaboration with the medical school/ anatomy suite and external speakers. This day promoted interprofessional learning, aimed to provide a link to ‘real world’ practices for students and showcased a successful partnership within ARU and external agencies.
15. ""You Can Auto-mate!"" community
Introducing the ""You Can Auto-Mate!"" community, bringing together everyone in ARU - staff and students, to harness the power of technology to make daily work-related tasks easier. A community where the experts, amateurs and novices around the university can share best practices, ideas for simple automation and help each other where needed.
16. Supporting students' professional development and engagement with ARUCPD
The Faculty of Business and Law introduces ARUCPD, an innovative co-curricular programme designed to support students’ professional development. Accredited by ARU, not only enhances students' transcripts but also equips students with knowledge and skills essential for today's and future workplace.
ARUCPD's impact on employability and student engagement is undeniable and has been recognised internally and externally. With over 2500 participants in the first two trimesters of 2023/2024 alone, ARUCPD is attracting interest from students and staff across all Faculties at ARU.
Our workshop will explain the ARUCPD's framework and guide participants in designing their own student-focused professional development modules. The activity will also foster dialogue on how these modules can potentially be integrated within the ARUCPD programme in the future.
17. Empowering Your Students through Digital Fluency
Developing your student’s digital fluency will help them to engage in their learning and will develop their employability as an outcome of their learning experience. Using the Developing Digital Fluency Workbook, the session we give you space to develop approaches for integrating digital experiences into your teaching to foster fluency. The workshop will also introduce the researched-informed approach being taken by the project team as we work with employers, academics, students, and other universities to develop our understanding of digital fluency and its critical importance to student success.
18. Decolonising and diversifying STEM education: Insights from the Unlearning Away Days
Decolonising and diversifying higher education is a concept and movement aimed at rectifying historical biases, ongoing inequalities, and prevalence of Eurocentric perspectives within the sector. Its overarching objective is to cultivate a more inclusive, diverse, and equitable higher education landscape by challenging established paradigms. In this workshop, we will provide a forum for debate on decolonisation or diversification followed by reflections on what we learnt from the Race Equality Away Day offered in the school level in two different faculties (HEMs and FSE). These events were used to explore structural racism using relevant data for each School, followed by interactive presentations. This presentation includes some key learning points and reflections from our Race Equality Away Days to share good practices, stimulate thinking with peers across ARU and connect people to support continuation with work on enhancing inclusive practices.
19. International Cultural Competence
Research (Aisha, and Mulyana, 2020; Dagus, et al., 2024; Garside et al., 2023; Safari, McKenna, and Davis, 2022.) has shown that International students from different countries experience almost the same communication issues and culture shock. There is also a concerning mismatch between their expectations and experience in the UK. Evidence (Gopal et al., 2023; Noltensmeyer, Bloom, and Rush, 2024) has also highlighted the importance of preparing lecturers to facilitate adequate adaptation through cultural awareness, knowledge, and sensitivity. This interactive session is meant to raise awareness about cultural understanding and elements contributing to culture shock experienced by international students and highlight some strategies for coping mechanisms.
20. Our students' favourite learning experiences
The ARU Active Learning Network gathered case studies from ARU students to find out their favourite learning experiences, in the form of videos, written pieces and more.
21. Approaches to drive student engagement and success through innovative, inclusive, and impactful bespoke interventions: The development of the Centre for Student Success at Anglia Ruskin University
Established in 2023, the Centre for Student Success (CfSS) in the Faculty of Business and Law aims to improve student engagement, success rates, and inclusivity. Collaborating with different stakeholders across the faculty, the CfSS developed a method of targeted interventions at specific points of the academic cycle: students’ registration, weekly engagement, and the enhancement of personal development tutoring (PDT). Student engagement, whether online or on campus, was monitored weekly, and students were directed to the most appropriate support based on their circumstances. The CfSS monitored data and measured the impact of the interventions, and these findings will be presented to serve as guidance for other institutions to adopt.
22. Impact achieved and future prospects: an overview of FSE ""Succeeding"" 2024
""Succeeding"" 2024 was the inaugural employability and careers event for Science and Engineering students. Attendees will gain insights into the event’s impact on student engagement and employability, and can use this knowledge to organise similar career-enhancing initiatives in their own contexts.",2651,2.6466727,4.698413,1

08/04/2025
You’ve done the research and written your first draft. Now it’s time for one of the most crucial jobs as a writer – revising your writing to ensure your reader does not have to work too hard to understand what is being said. It is the final part of the writing process before you submit your work, and it has two distinct steps: editing and proofreading. 50% of the time you allocate to writing should be spent on these two steps. Here’s some advice to help you edit and proofread effectively.
Editing
Editing is what you begin doing as soon as you finish your first draft. You can edit on several levels:
- Content: Have you addressed all aspects of the brief? Is all the information in your paper relevant? Is your writing balanced? (e.g., Have you written an appropriate number of words for the importance of each idea? Is any section too long?) Are the claims you make accurate and consistent with the argument you are building?
- Overall structure: Does your paper have an appropriate introduction and conclusion? Are the paragraphs arranged in a logical sequence? Use reverse outlining to check whether your argument flows across the text.
- Structure within paragraph: Is each paragraph a single-focused logical unit of information? Does it begin with a clear opening sentence? Do the sentences flow from given-to-new? Do you avoid very short and very long paragraphs?
- Clarity: Is there clear purpose, unity and flow of thought? Is the meaning of each sentence clear? Avoid overlong sentences and keep a short distance between your subject and its verb.
Proofreading
Proofreading is the final stage of the writing process. Actively search your writing for surface errors:
- Language: Look out for spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. Small mistakes can slip through even after multiple edits, so be thorough.
- Referencing: Make sure all your citations and references are in line with Cranfield’s referencing guidelines. Double-check the accuracy of names, titles, and the punctuation used in your references.
- Formatting: Ensure your layout, tables, figures, font size, page numbers, and headers are all correct according to your module guidelines.
Tips for effective editing and proofreading
- Change the visual: You’ll be less likely to skim or jump over sections if your document looks different. If you can, print your work and edit in hard copy, convert your document to PDF or change the font for a similar effect.
- Take a break: If possible, leave some time between finishing your draft and revising it. This allows you to return with fresh eyes and a more critical perspective.
- Focus on one aspect at a time: Don’t try to catch everything in one go. Start with one aspect in your checklist and then move onto the next. This methodical approach helps ensure nothing gets overlooked.
- Read aloud: Reading your work out loud slows you down, helping you catch errors in expression and punctuation. You can also use text-to-speech tools, like the Immersive Reader in Word Online, to assist with this.
- Mind the cut and paste: If you’ve moved sections around, make sure the sentences still make sense and that your tenses, genders, and plurals are correct throughout.
- Punctuation matters: Familiarize yourself with the rules for commas, apostrophes, colons, and semi-colons. Proper punctuation can significantly improve the clarity and professionalism of your writing.
- Get a fresh perspective: While you need to be careful about asking someone else to proofread your work, you can ask a friend to read it and tell you if it makes sense. A fresh set of eyes can often catch things you’ve missed.
- Learn from feedback: Use feedback from previous assignments to create a checklist of common errors you make. Keep this list handy while proofreading to help eliminate these mistakes in future work.
Should I get a professional proof-reader to look at my work?
You can, but we don’t expect you to. If you choose to, you must read the following explanation of the proof reader’s role, under section 3.5 of the Cranfield University Senate Handbook on Academic Misconduct (2024, p. 10-11), which is available here.
Can I use a proofreading tool?
Yes, you can. We don’t recommend any in particular, but there are a number of proofreading tools out there, with Grammarly being one of the best known. If you use an AI tool (like Grammarly) you must make sure you abide by the rules here – Generative AI guidance – and acknowledge your use.
Helpful resources
There is more information on our Study Skills Hub about academic writing and there you can also find out more about the free training and 1-2-1 support that our Academic Language team can offer. If you’re looking to sharpen your editing and proofreading skills, there are plenty of resources available there to help you with this too.
If you still have questions, please contact our Academic Language team.

Generative AI is the generic term for a number of tools that have been trained, using a huge amount of already-existing data, to ‘create’ new, original content. The most widely-known applications of Generative AI use text prompts from users to generate this content. These include:
It should be noted that Generative AI and the use of AI productivity tools are evolving rapidly. The guidance on these support pages will evolve accordingly.

- Radical Matter is a profoundly interdisciplinary art-science research lab situated in the RCA's School of Arts & Humanities (SoAH) and working across the College, led by Professor Johnny Golding and Dr Jonathan Boyd.
- It is linked globally with art-philosophy-wild science curiosity-driven environments (including at Angewandte (University of Applied Arts, Vienna), Cavendish ArtsScience (Cambridge), Glasgow School of Art (Glasgow), Living Architecture (Waterloo, CA), Experimental Moving Image (London), with researcher-artist-scholars at all stages of enquiry (independent, PhD, postdoctoral, ECR, mid-career, well-established).
- Radical Matter develops a different approach to AI as ‘distributed intelligence’ – closer to an emergent multi-modal poetics – where pattern, colour, tone, mood and atmosphere create a new, twenty-first-century knowledge system, away from Enlightenment thinking, enabling a new form of democratic imaginaries to circulate and grow.
- We focus on a new logic of sense, one that includes holographic spatialities, human-interspecies-machinic co-evolution, generative AI and distributed ‘intelligences’ from the common octopus to point cloud assets.

Delegates and business leaders gather in London to explore how Generative and Agentic AI is reshaping the workplace and life as we know it
Now in its ninth year, AI Summit London (11-12 June 2025), attracted 4,000 delegates, business leaders, sponsors and VIPs over two days of insights and inspiration across eight themed stages. The event united global business leaders, Governmental policymakers, AI pioneers and academia from the London Business School, to tackle some of the biggest topics and trends in the AI space, with one being the Future of Work. The summit explored how Generative AI is transforming the workplace, empowering teams, reshaping roles and driving productivity.
Speaking on the Headliners stage as part of a panel discussion titled ""Agentic AI (AGI): An Engineering Problem or Science Fiction?"", Michael G Jacobides Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship at London Business School, warned of a potentially uneven economic impact across certain industries over the coming years as AGI evolves. He noted that while some sectors may face disruption, others particularly tech firms able to acquire and scale AI-driven knowledge work will stand to benefit. “Rather than focusing solely on who AI may eliminate, complement or replace,” he said, “we need to think strategically about what the future landscape will look like in a world shaped by AI.”
Over on the Sustainable Innovation stage, LBS’ Adjunct Assistant Professor Ekaterina Abramova moderated a lively and engaging panel on Scaling AI Sustainability: Balancing Cost, Performance and Impact. Touching on a number of topics such as how enterprises are scaling AI and what infrastructure challenges they are running into, to how data centres can support the environmental goals of AI-driven companies.
To break this down was a panel of distinguished experts from across commerce, including Scott Wallace, Senior Global Director of Solutions Architecture, working from the office of CTO for Digital Realty, Sue Preston VP & GM Worldwide Advisory & Professional Services for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Sam Livingstone, Head of Quantitative Strategies for Ambienta and Nadia Abouayoub, Global Trading Pricing and Technology Strategy Leader.
The panellists discussed efficient model design, low-energy compute strategies, the environmental cost of data centers and the ethical risks of unchecked deployment. They emphasised cross-sector collaboration, smarter resource use and transparency to ensure AI scales in a high-performing and responsible way. A robust Q&A followed until the time ran out.
One of the many notable guest speakers at the event was New York City’s Chief Technology Officer Matthew C. Fraser, speaking to a capacity audience, he outlined his vision of AI as both subtle and transformative in urban life; “If AI is used well, most people won’t notice it,” Fraser commented; “What they’ll notice is an easier experience.” This belief that the best technology works invisibly drives New York’s push to lead in applied AI.
Another well attended session on the main stage featured Dr Craig Brown, Director of Investment for the UK Space Agency speaking about his aims to explore how space will become the next frontier for AI-driven infrastructure. From AI-powered lunar data centres to sustainable habitats, delegates learned about the role of intelligent systems in transforming space into an extension of Earth and how these advancements could one day redefine global connectivity.

WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management is the first German business school to collaborate with OpenAI, a leader in artificial intelligence and deployment, to implement ChatGPT Edu across its institution. In providing access to this powerful tool, WHU is allowing its currently enrolled students, as well as its academic and professional staff, to take advantage of this revolutionary technology and all it has to offer.
“AI is unbelievably powerful, and it is changing our lives on a fundamental level. It is imperative to understand how AI will impact our futures—and how everyone, especially our students, can use it responsibly for the greater good,” noted Christian Andres, Dean of WHU. “With our collaboration, we are going way beyond simply offering free access to certain models. And it is not only our students who will be able to use this amazing technology. We want to make sure that our organization as a whole embraces all the opportunities that AI offers, too.”
Leah Belsky, General Manager of Education at OpenAI, said: “AI is already transforming education by personalizing learning, accelerating academic research, and boosting productivity for faculty staff. In rolling out ChatGPT Edu across its entire organization, WHU is not only embracing the potential of AI, but getting students and staff ready for an AI future.”
Accordingly, the school plans to fully integrate the use of AI into its curricula, research activities, and administrative processes. By providing access to ChatGPT Edu, WHU will be able to make good use of OpenAI’s latest models and advanced capabilities, such as personalized tutoring, writing, data analytics, and document summarization.

Facing forward: The business school will integrate OpenAI tools and resources into its curricula, research, and administrative processes
WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management is the first German business school to collaborate with OpenAI, a leader in artificial intelligence and deployment, to implement ChatGPT Edu across its institution. In providing access to this powerful tool, WHU is allowing its currently enrolled students, as well as its academic and professional staff, to take advantage of this revolutionary technology and all it has to offer.
“AI is unbelievably powerful, and it is changing our lives on a fundamental level. It is imperative to understand how AI will impact our futures—and how everyone, especially our students, can use it responsibly for the greater good,” noted Christian Andres, Dean of WHU. “With our collaboration, we are going way beyond simply offering free access to certain models. And it is not only our students who will be able to use this amazing technology. We want to make sure that our organization as a whole embraces all the opportunities that AI offers, too.”
Leah Belsky, General Manager of Education at OpenAI, said: “AI is already transforming education by personalizing learning, accelerating academic research, and boosting productivity for faculty staff. In rolling out ChatGPT Edu across its entire organization, WHU is not only embracing the potential of AI, but getting students and staff ready for an AI future.”
Accordingly, the school plans to fully integrate the use of AI into its curricula, research activities, and administrative processes. By providing access to ChatGPT Edu, WHU will be able to make good use of OpenAI’s latest models and advanced capabilities, such as personalized tutoring, writing, data analytics, and document summarization. ChatGPT Edu also includes enterprise-level security to ensure WHU introduces AI in a way that is safe, secure, and respectful of sensitive data. “This is a major investment in our students’ future and the future of WHU as an institution,” said Dr. Toni Calabretti, Chairman of the WHU Foundation. “With our commitment to AI, we can ensure that WHU is at the forefront of this exciting time in technology.”

VIEWPOINT: ARU expert discusses new research looking at AI-generated poetry
By Jon Stone, Anglia Ruskin University
Has the bell finally tolled for Shakespeare and Byron? New research conducted by philosophers of science Brian Porter and Edouard Machery suggests that the latest AI-generated poetry is “indistinguishable from human-written poetry” and “rated more favourably”.
Ten poets, from the medieval Geoffrey Chaucer to modern writer Dorothea Lasky, were successfully impersonated by AI chatbots, with most of the 696 participants slightly preferring the imitation to the real thing.
Porter and Machery conclude that “the capabilities of generative AI models have outpaced people’s expectations of AI”. But they don’t say AI has been proven an adequate replacement for human poets – and rightly so, as such a conclusion would require a great deal more testing.
That the research participants were fooled is not particularly worrying. Porter and Machery set out to include a wide range of poem types, which meant choosing poets who mostly belong to ages past. In such cases, modern readers are likely to have a hard time looking past the obvious signs of antiquity – outdated diction, rigid formalism, and obscure cultural references. It’s not so hard to disguise yourself as someone when that person is chiefly known for the odd clothes they wear.
But what about the matter of preference? As well as overall quality, the researchers asked participants to rate poems on a range of qualitative dimensions. How was the imagery, rhythm, sound or beauty? How “inspiring”, “lyrical”, “meaningful”, “moving”, “original”, “profound”, “witty” (and so on) was it? AI won out over Shakespeare and company in nearly every category.
Does this mean human poets have been supplanted? Not really. Participants in the research overall reported “a low level of experience with poetry”. Lack of familiarity with any artform severely limits our ability to get the most out of it. All the AI has to do is sand off the more challenging elements – ambiguity, wordplay, linguistic complexity – in order to produce a version which is more palatable to those with little interest in the art.
If that sounds snobbish, think of it this way: when we aren’t used to eating a foreign cuisine, most of us gravitate toward the blandly familiar end of the menu.
But poetry is not a medium many look to for instant gratification. The reason poets of the calibre of Byron and Walt Whitman (both of whom were included in this study) continue to command respect is because their poetry rewards extended, rather than cursory, attention. The report agrees on this point, noting that participants complained more often of the human-authored poems that they “don’t make sense”.
For now, then, poets have little reason to fret. Is it possible, though, that we aren’t too far off the point where seasoned readers of poetry are able to discover a richness and depth in AI poetry that outstrips similar efforts by humans? I think so – not least because a substantial contributor to the emotional and intellectual impact of a poem is the reader’s own imagination.
It is the reader who, through the act of reading, brings the words to life. For decades now, the concept of “found poetry” – as well as collage poetry and other related techniques – has rested on the fact that all language can be recontextualised as poetry, if arranged with care. For the skilled reader of poetry, the poem is a construction kit, or playground, for the mind to revel in.
But we must then ask, how many readers will choose to repeatedly commit the time and effort needed to draw meaning from AI-created texts? Is the pleasure of reading reward enough in itself?
For some, it will be. But I suspect for the majority, the real point of poetry is to put you in touch, in a very specific way, with other human minds. It is more social activity than technical feat.
In many cultures, the rituals that have grown around it are collaborative, participatory. Poetry is made not because we need poems to exist, but because we seek a keener, fuller awareness of each other – of the sense each of us makes of the world.
That does not mean AI won’t change poetry. Every recent generation of poets has been deeply interested in adapting and absorbing new technologies, along with shifts in cultural mood. Film poets continue to explore combinations of spoken word and moving image. Flarf poetry collected and reconfigured search engine detritus. And my own research into video game poetry has uncovered rapidly growing interest in a form of poetry that is restlessly interactive, playable, slippery.
Already, poets like Dan Power and Nick Flynn are collaborating in different ways with AI to uncover new avenues of possibility. And AI’s ability to approximate Shakespeare’s style is a technological marvel.
But art that merely imitates and iterates on what has come before is art at its most trivial. The goal of the poet is not to be mistaken for Shakespeare, but much the opposite: to make something never seen before.

It’s not so hard to disguise yourself as someone when that person is chiefly known for the odd clothes they wear.
But what about the matter of preference? As well as overall quality, the researchers asked participants to rate poems on a range of qualitative dimensions. How was the imagery, rhythm, sound or beauty? How “inspiring”, “lyrical”, “meaningful”, “moving”, “original”, “profound”, “witty” (and so on) was it? AI won out over Shakespeare and company in nearly every category.
Does this mean human poets have been supplanted? Not really. Participants in the research overall reported “a low level of experience with poetry”. Lack of familiarity with any artform severely limits our ability to get the most out of it. All the AI has to do is sand off the more challenging elements – ambiguity, wordplay, linguistic complexity – in order to produce a version which is more palatable to those with little interest in the art.
If that sounds snobbish, think of it this way: when we aren’t used to eating a foreign cuisine, most of us gravitate toward the blandly familiar end of the menu.
But poetry is not a medium many look to for instant gratification. The reason poets of the calibre of Byron and Walt Whitman (both of whom were included in this study) continue to command respect is because their poetry rewards extended, rather than cursory, attention. The report agrees on this point, noting that participants complained more often of the human-authored poems that they “don’t make sense”.
For now, then, poets have little reason to fret. Is it possible, though, that we aren’t too far off the point where seasoned readers of poetry are able to discover a richness and depth in AI poetry that outstrips similar efforts by humans? I think so – not least because a substantial contributor to the emotional and intellectual impact of a poem is the reader’s own imagination.
It is the reader who, through the act of reading, brings the words to life. For decades now, the concept of “found poetry” – as well as collage poetry and other related techniques – has rested on the fact that all language can be recontextualised as poetry, if arranged with care. For the skilled reader of poetry, the poem is a construction kit, or playground, for the mind to revel in.
But we must then ask, how many readers will choose to repeatedly commit the time and effort needed to draw meaning from AI-created texts? Is the pleasure of reading reward enough in itself?
For some, it will be. But I suspect for the majority, the real point of poetry is to put you in touch, in a very specific way, with other human minds. It is more social activity than technical feat.
In many cultures, the rituals that have grown around it are collaborative, participatory. Poetry is made not because we need poems to exist, but because we seek a keener, fuller awareness of each other – of the sense each of us makes of the world.
That does not mean AI won’t change poetry. Every recent generation of poets has been deeply interested in adapting and absorbing new technologies, along with shifts in cultural mood. Film poets continue to explore combinations of spoken word and moving image. Flarf poetry collected and reconfigured search engine detritus. And my own research into video game poetry has uncovered rapidly growing interest in a form of poetry that is restlessly interactive, playable, slippery.
Already, poets like Dan Power and Nick Flynn are collaborating in different ways with AI to uncover new avenues of possibility. And AI’s ability to approximate Shakespeare’s style is a technological marvel.
But art that merely imitates and iterates on what has come before is art at its most trivial. The goal of the poet is not to be mistaken for Shakespeare, but much the opposite: to make something never seen before.

Date 20 December 2024
20.12.2024At the recent Jisc AI Winter HE Community Event, Jane Mills talked about how Artificial Intelligence is transforming the fashion industry, from design to retail. She shared how integrating AI tools into the fashion curriculum can help students brainstorm ideas, overcome creative blocks, and take their creative concepts further. She advised that by embedding ethical AI practices into their learning, we can make sure students know how to use AI responsibly, as a partner to inspire and refine their work, while respecting originality and academic integrity. This approach helps equip our graduates with the cutting-edge skills they need to bridge creativity, technology, and the ever-changing demands of a tech-driven industry.
I was invited to speak at the Jisc AI Winter HE Community Event on 13 December, where over 100 attendees gathered to explore the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education. The event was hosted by the University of London and provided a superb venue for thought-provoking discussions and insights.
The day featured a wide-ranging lineup of speakers, including Dr. Manal Matough from Coventry University, discussing AI in healthcare training, Lisa Harris and Stephen Hickman talked about embedding generative AI in distance learning, and Ros Walker of University of St Andrews exploring AI as a reasonable adjustment for disability.
Dr. Melanie Stockton-Brownfrom University of Reading and Szilvia Ruszev, from Bournemouth University led an engaging session on AI and copyright in creative industries, and Kirstin McLenaghan and Wolf Wright from The University of Law showcased their Custom GPT tool, ALiCE.
In my talk on AI in the fashion industry, I had the opportunity to expand on the themes of my earlier blog, published in August, titled AI in Universities and Colleges: Examples in Education. I shared how AI tools are helping fashion students brainstorm, overcome creative barriers, and produce innovative designs.
My thanks to Micheal Webb, Director of AI at Jisc, who reflected on the event on LinkedIn, and for highlighting his enthusiastic endorsement for both my presentation and the imagery that I shared. It was interesting to see so many academics sharing their experiences and innovations, highlighting the huge potential of AI to transform the future of Higher Education.
Pertinent to this in my presentation, I was able to highlight the approach that we have taken at UON in that our fashion students are encouraged to see AI as a supportive tool while also understanding the importance of respecting ethical boundaries, such as academic integrity. I also talked about rolling out my pilot for the Fashion Digital Tools Logbook, which helps ensure AI is used transparently and effectively in academic work. The logbook guides students in documenting their use of AI tools and processes, encouraging responsible practices, enhancing their learning, and helping them avoid unintentional academic misconduct.
Student Case Studies
I also shared inspiring examples of how both past and current students have used AI creatively, including:
Baylie’s Textile Colour Exploration
Baylie, a final-year textile student, used AI to re-colourise an old black & white family photograph of her great-great grandfather’s Chinese restaurant, the first in Luton in 1944. AI helped her explore authentic 1940s tones, which inspired the colour palette for her printed and dyed textiles, celebrating her cultural heritage.
China’s Footwear & Accessory Concept Development
China, a final-year footwear and accessory student, uses AI to overcome challenges with dyslexia. AI generates visuals for her dream diary, allowing her to capture the textures and colours of her vivid, surreal dreams. This helps her transform personal experiences into visual representations that effectively communicate her ideas.
Final Thoughts
AI is becoming essential in both the fashion industry and fashion education, it’s no longer optional and its key to preparing students for the future. However, there are still challenges, like questions about originality, authorship, and biases in AI systems. To keep AI a positive force for creativity, we need ethical frameworks that encourage responsible use and can tackle these issues head-on.
AI isn’t just a tool, it’s transforming how we design, produce, and experience fashion. As shown in the students’ case studies, combining personal creativity with AI can lead to groundbreaking work, helping them overcome creative blocks and turn ideas into innovative designs. By embracing AI, we are not just preparing our students to adapt but empowering them to lead. Our focus needs to be on helping them navigate AI’s opportunities and challenges with confidence and integrity, harnessing its potential to enhance their creativity while staying true to their unique voice.

The Centre for Innovation in Higher Education (CIHE) held its national pedagogic research conference, on the theme of Moving into Pedagogic Research, which took place on ARU’s Cambridge campus on Thursday 11 July 2024. It was attended by 100 delegates from ARU and other UK and overseas HEIs. There were 26 presentations, including eight external, six workshops and five posters. We were delighted that delegates from ARU and other UK and international institutions joined us, underscoring the significance of this event within the pedagogic research community.
One of the highlights of the event was the keynote address on ""Pedagogic Research: A Catalyst for Educational Change"" by Dr Becky Turner from the University of Plymouth. Becky’s valuable insights provided a thought-provoking and inspiring start to the conference. We were also pleased to welcome both national and international speakers to the conference. One of our international presenters, Vienne Lin from the Chinese University in Hong Kong, recorded her presentation and joined us via video conference from Hong Kong for the Q&A session.
Feedback has been positive, one delegate wrote: 'I really enjoyed attending the inaugural CIHE conference. The Conference provided me with an excellent opportunity to learn about innovative pedagogic research and practice both within ARU and beyond. The thought-provoking sessions helped me consider my own work and pedagogic research. Through networking activities at the Conference, I have developed future collaborative opportunities for my pedagogic research.'
This conference plays a pivotal part in the rapid expansion of pedagogic research in higher education and CIHE was honoured to facilitate it. Following its success, it has been agreed to run the Conference annually.
Keynote
Our keynote was Dr Becky Turner, an Associate Professor in Educational Development based at the University of Plymouth, and a Principal Fellow of the HEA. She discussed Pedagogic research: a catalyst for educational change at the conference.
At Plymouth Becky provides teaching development for staff working across the University, from PhD students taking their first steps into teaching to established lecturers seeking recognition for their contributions to learning, teaching and student support.
She is an active researcher, undertaking work at Plymouth on agendas such as curriculum enhancement, inclusive practice and student voice. Her research is designed to provide an evidence base to inform pedagogic change and innovation. Through this, Becky uses pedagogic research to provide a platform for groups who may be overlooked or underrepresented within the wider University community. Beyond Plymouth, Becky has undertaken several nationally funded projects focused on student unions, learning gain and impact evaluation.

CIHE Annual Conference 2024: Moving into Pedagogic Research
The Centre for Innovation in Higher Education (CIHE) held its national pedagogic research conference, on the theme of Moving into Pedagogic Research, which took place on ARU’s Cambridge campus on Thursday 11 July 2024. It was attended by 100 delegates from ARU and other UK and overseas HEIs. There were 26 presentations, including eight external, six workshops and five posters. We were delighted that delegates from ARU and other UK and international institutions joined us, underscoring the significance of this event within the pedagogic research community.
One of the highlights of the event was the keynote address on ""Pedagogic Research: A Catalyst for Educational Change"" by Dr Becky Turner from the University of Plymouth. Becky’s valuable insights provided a thought-provoking and inspiring start to the conference. We were also pleased to welcome both national and international speakers to the conference. One of our international presenters, Vienne Lin from the Chinese University in Hong Kong, recorded her presentation and joined us via video conference from Hong Kong for the Q&A session.
Feedback has been positive, one delegate wrote: 'I really enjoyed attending the inaugural CIHE conference. The Conference provided me with an excellent opportunity to learn about innovative pedagogic research and practice both within ARU and beyond. The thought-provoking sessions helped me consider my own work and pedagogic research. Through networking activities at the Conference, I have developed future collaborative opportunities for my pedagogic research.'
This conference plays a pivotal part in the rapid expansion of pedagogic research in higher education and CIHE was honoured to facilitate it. Following its success, it has been agreed to run the Conference annually.
Keynote
Our keynote was Dr Becky Turner, an Associate Professor in Educational Development based at the University of Plymouth, and a Principal Fellow of the HEA. She discussed Pedagogic research: a catalyst for educational change at the conference.
At Plymouth Becky provides teaching development for staff working across the University, from PhD students taking their first steps into teaching to established lecturers seeking recognition for their contributions to learning, teaching and student support.
She is an active researcher, undertaking work at Plymouth on agendas such as curriculum enhancement, inclusive practice and student voice. Her research is designed to provide an evidence base to inform pedagogic change and innovation. Through this, Becky uses pedagogic research to provide a platform for groups who may be overlooked or underrepresented within the wider University community. Beyond Plymouth, Becky has undertaken several nationally funded projects focused on student unions, learning gain and impact evaluation.

The year 2023 is proving to be a fascinating one for generative AI tools, with ChatGPT, the latest chatbot from OpenAI, crossing the 100 million user line in January 2023, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in a short period of time (source: DemandSage). ChatGPT is a large language model that provides detailed answers to a wide range of questions. Ask it to summarise a report, structure a presentation or activities for your session and you may well be pleased with the results. ChatGPT’s ease of use, speed of response, and detailed answers have seen it quickly dominate the AI generator market and gain both widespread acclaim and criticism.
While early media attention focused on the negative, playing on sci-fi tropes and the out-of-control desires of AI tools, scientists such as Stephen Wolfram have been exploring and explaining the capabilities and intricacies of ChatGPT, expertly raising awareness of its underlying Large Language Model architecture and its limitations as a tool.
In his recent talk on the Turnitin Webinar ‘AI: friend or foe?’, Robin Crockett – Academic Integrity Lead here at UON, discussed how a better understanding of the ability of ChatGPT to create content can be used to deter cheating with AI tools. However, concerns have also been raised about students using the tool to cheat, claiming that minimal effort required to enter an essay question in ChatGPT may produce an essay that may be of an adequate standard to, at least, pass an assessment (source: The Guardian).

One thing the media stories seem to agree upon is that generative AI tools have the potential to change the way we do things and challenge the status quo, with some traditional skill sets at risk of becoming replaced by AI, and new opportunities for those who embrace these technologies.
In terms of how AI might be utilised by academic staff, Lee Machado, Professor of Molecular Medicine, describes his use of AI tools in cancer classification and how AI tools might be used to help answer questions in his field. Lee also discusses how he feels AI tools such as ChatGPT could improve student experiences by providing personalised feedback on essays and by simplifying complex information.
In the following interview, Jane Mills, Senior Lecturer in Fashion and Textiles, discusses how the fashion industry is embracing AI, emphasising that rather than AI replacing creativity, it can be used to enhance creative work. Students Amalia Samoila and Donald Mubangizi reflect on the collaborative nature of working with AI, using examples of their current work.
In his interview, Rob Howe, Head of Learning Technology, discusses the evolution of AI technology and its impact on the academic world. He explains that AI has come a long way since the original definitions by Minsky and Turing in the 1950s and that improvements in processing speed and access to data have made it a revolution in technology. Rob describes how AI technology has already been integrated into tools and academic systems in universities and how the rise of AI technology has led to a change in the way assignments are being considered, as students may now be using AI systems to assist in their studies. Although there is discussion around institutions wishing to ban the use of AI in academic work, Rob emphasizes the importance of learning to live with such tools and using them in a way that supports educators and students. AI systems have the potential to be a valuable resource for tutors to generate learning outcomes and offer new ideas which can then be critically evaluated and modified.
Exploring AI through multiple platforms and apps is a great way for users to get started. However, it’s important to note that not all AI tools are free. While many offer free tokens or limited availability for new users, some require payment. Our team member, inspired by the use of AI-generated images by an art student at UON, tried the IOS app, Dawn AI, which offered a 3-day trial. They enjoyed generating 48 new versions of themselves and even created versions of themselves as a warrior and video game character.
However, it’s important to consider whether using AI in this way is simply a gimmick or if it has a more purposeful use. It’s easy to dismiss AI-generated images as mere novelties, but the potential applications of this technology are vast and varied. AI-generated images can be used in advertising, social media marketing, and even in the film industry. As AI continues to develop and evolve, we’re likely to see even more innovative and exciting uses for this technology. The possibilities are endless.
The full extent of how AI tools will fit into daily academic life is yet to be determined. While some believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize the way in which we teach and learn, others remain skeptical about its ethical implications and its potential to negatively impact student engagement.
One of the main concerns is whether AI tools will prove to be a positive tool to enhance creativity and support students or whether they will provide a shortcut to assessments that undermine the learning process. It is clear that there are significant implications for how educators use AI tools in the classroom.
To explore these issues and more, Rob Howe, Head of Learning Technology at the University of Northampton (supported by University staff, external colleagues and the National Centre for A.I.), will be running a series of debates and talks on campus and online. These discussions will aim to assess the potential of AI tools and examine their ethical implications. Participants will discuss the challenges and opportunities presented by AI, and debate the best ways to incorporate these tools into the classroom.
The first of these debates, titled, ‘The computers are taking over…?’, is on March 15th. The full details can be found here;

The journey to university is filled with choices that shape a student's future. Many are drawn to law, captivated by its prestige, the prospect of significant earnings, and the opportunity to influence societal change.
However, the rigorous nature of a law degree requires unwavering commitment, a sharp analytical mind, and the aptitude for understanding intricate matters. Some students may flourish in this setting, while others might discover that their true calling lies elsewhere.
We'll provide a balanced overview of what a law degree offers and how it compares to other degrees.
What is a Law Degree?
A law degree is a deep dive into the legal systems, principles, and procedures that govern society. Modules help students understand the nuances, historical contexts, and real-world applications of UK law.
Skills Gained in a Law Degree:
- Critical Thinking: Law students learn to analyse complex scenarios, identify underlying issues, and approach problems logically.
- Research and Analysis: Delving deep into case laws, statutes, and legal commentary helps students become adept at research and extracting relevant information.
- Effective Communication: From drafting legal documents to arguing a case, a law degree ensures students can communicate clearly and persuasively.
- Ethical Judgement: Law students develop a keen sense of ethical responsibility and learn the importance of integrity in their profession.
Why Choose a Law Degree Over Other Degrees?
- Transferable Skills: The skills acquired in a law degree, such as research, analysis, and communication, are invaluable across a range of professions.
- Lucrative Career Opportunities: Law is a route into high-paying jobs, not just in legal practice but in sectors like finance, business, and public relations.
- Universal Relevance: Laws and regulations touch almost every aspect of our lives. This universal relevance is a significant advantage, especially for those leaning toward social justice or policy-making.
When Might Another Degree be More Suitable?
While a law degree offers numerous benefits, it may not be the perfect fit for everyone or every situation.
- Specific Career Aspirations: If you're looking to enter fields like medicine, construction, or cyber security, specialised degrees in those areas would offer more relevant training and expertise.
- Business Ventures: For those planning on starting a business, a business degree might offer more comprehensive insights into operations, strategy, and management. While a law degree would teach legal compliance, it wouldn't provide insights into marketing strategies or financial modelling.
- Artistic Pursuits: If you're inclined towards arts, design, or entertainment, degrees in those specific fields would likely be more beneficial, giving you hands-on experience and industry connections.
Many professionals and businesses appreciate the legal knowledge that law graduates bring, especially in negotiations or contract-related matters. However, they often also emphasise the importance of specific industry knowledge, which might be better gained through specialised degrees.
Concluding Thoughts
Choosing the right degree is a significant decision, with long-term implications for one's career and personal satisfaction. A law degree is a powerful tool, especially for those with aspirations in the legal field or sectors where legal knowledge is invaluable.
However, it's essential to ensure that the degree aligns with one's career goals and personal interests. It's important to research thoroughly, seek guidance, and think before committing to a degree. While a law degree offers broad applicability and a strong foundation in critical skills, it may not be the optimal choice for every individual or every career path.
The best degree for you is one that aligns with your aspirations, strengths, and passions.

- Specific Career Aspirations: If you're looking to enter fields like medicine, construction, or cyber security, specialised degrees in those areas would offer more relevant training and expertise.
- Business Ventures: For those planning on starting a business, a business degree might offer more comprehensive insights into operations, strategy, and management. While a law degree would teach legal compliance, it wouldn't provide insights into marketing strategies or financial modelling.
- Artistic Pursuits: If you're inclined towards arts, design, or entertainment, degrees in those specific fields would likely be more beneficial, giving you hands-on experience and industry connections.
Many professionals and businesses appreciate the legal knowledge that law graduates bring, especially in negotiations or contract-related matters. However, they often also emphasise the importance of specific industry knowledge, which might be better gained through specialised degrees.
Concluding Thoughts
Choosing the right degree is a significant decision, with long-term implications for one's career and personal satisfaction. A law degree is a powerful tool, especially for those with aspirations in the legal field or sectors where legal knowledge is invaluable.
However, it's essential to ensure that the degree aligns with one's career goals and personal interests. It's important to research thoroughly, seek guidance, and think before committing to a degree. While a law degree offers broad applicability and a strong foundation in critical skills, it may not be the optimal choice for every individual or every career path.
The best degree for you is one that aligns with your aspirations, strengths, and passions.

Disinformation has been a feature of conflicts throughout history. However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has seen a significant increase in the creation and distribution of disinformation, ‘fake news’ and other misleading sources.
CILIP (The Library and information association) has suggested that it is important to be conscious of this when considering how best to minimise the risks of spreading information.
STOP
Consider bias: Consider how your own biases may affect how you engage with media about the invasion.
Be sceptical: Be sceptical about everything you see and read, whatever the source.
How do I feel? Does the content or media seem designed to elicit an emotional reaction, to prompt you to click or read more?
Who benefits? If the content or media seems designed to support a particular point of view, whose interests does this serve?
VERIFY
Use trusted sources: Always make sure you are getting your information from a reputable and trusted source, ideally one that is transparent about its point-of-view.
Get the whole story: Always take time to read the whole story and then go and find supporting evidence from other sources.
Spot fake media: A lot of social media content, including video and images have been shown to be fake. Visit for more
SHARE
Be a source: Develop information resources, collections and materials which help your users to access trusted and up-to-date information.
Call it out: Where you encounter fake news or disinformation relating to the conflict, correct it, providing a link to supporting evidence.
Educate your users: You are ideally-placed to help your users develop their media and research skills - see for more

Overview
Our innovative LLM integrates criminal law, evidence and procedure with the insights of criminology and psychology into the practices of the criminal courts.
You will gain a practical and theoretical understanding of criminal law and justice whilst developing expertise in the principles of English criminal law with a focus on the practices of presenting, analysing and evaluating evidence. The course will draw on the insights of psychological research to deepen your understanding of the practical application of witness testimony and other types of evidence. You will further explore and use your knowledge of psychological research to assess witness evidence. Our psychology labs and mock courtroom are used to test and develop ideas about the impact of context and memory on the reliability of testimony and evidence.
- Mock court sessions will allow you to participate in a range of different roles and types of court hearing - applying your knowledge of criminal law and procedure.
- You will use the specialist equipment in our psychology labs to evaluate witness testimony.
- The course will be taught by specialist lecturers in Law and Psychology to enable students to develop an integrated understanding of criminal law, evidence and procedure.
Course Modules
Downloadable information regarding all University of Suffolk courses, including Key Facts, Course Aims, Course Structure and Assessment, is available in the Definitive Course Record.
This module will introduce the key principles of criminal liability as a refresher for those who have previously studied criminal law and an introduction to those who have not. The module will then explore a range of contemporary offences and defences that are often the subject of much public interest and debate, such as sexual and domestic abuse offences as well as online offending and fraud which is increasingly common. As well as gaining knowledge of contemporary criminal law and applying it accurately to case studies, you will analyse and critically evaluate how the criminal law responds to different types of offending. Is the law keeping pace with technological changes? What are the weaknesses and gaps in the criminal law? How should the law be reformed and why?
This module will build on the Contemporary Criminal Law module to enable you to develop a detailed knowledge of how the rules of evidence and procedure operate in the criminal courts. This module also aims to give students a detailed overview of the connection between criminal evidence and psychology.
You will explore the significance and impact of specific types of evidence including those which can be considered controversial, such as eyewitness testimony, identification and recognition evidence, confession evidence, expert evidence and the way in which vulnerable people are treated by the courts. These topics will be examined from the perspectives of both law and psychology enabling students to draw on contemporary cases and research from both disciplines. This module will use the expertise of specialists in psychology to offer a different perspective and to challenge the assumptions related to particular types of evidence.
You will also develop your advocacy skills in our mock courtroom by participating in a range of different types of hearings (such as trials, sentencing and appeals) based on realistic case studies.
International Criminal Justice Systems will introduce you to challenging concepts in international law, particularly when dealing with individual criminal responsibility. We spend time understanding how international law is made and, most importantly, enforced. You will learn about international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions. We will look at historical tribunals including Nuremberg, Tokyo, Rwanda, and Yugoslavia, leading us to the International Criminal Court and the Rome Statute. We conclude with exploring controversies in International Criminal Law, including R2P (Responsibility to Protect), intervention, and the effectiveness of the International Criminal Court.
Throughout the LLM, you are encouraged to distinguish between, and critically evaluate, different theoretical, technical, normative, ethical and practical approaches to the operation of criminal law and justice. Having completed your taught modules, you will continue to develop your understanding in more specialised areas.
Building upon knowledge gained previously, you will conduct in-depth examinations of theories and research, with emphasis being placed upon critical evaluation of both theory, methods and contemporary practices.
Your independent project will provide the opportunity to demonstrate your advanced scholarship and academic abilities in an original, creative way, to find effective solutions to real-life problems or legal issues. The dissertation brings together your work undertaken in previous modules, develops your subject matter expertise, and challenges you to develop a proposal into an actionable, practice-relevant project that can inform future developments in your field.
Please note that the dissertation would be conducted instead of the work placement.
This module provides an opportunity to find, arrange, and conduct a work placement in the broad field of criminal justice. The placement would be conducted in the third term, after taught modules are complete. You will, however, be responsible for making placement arrangements well in advance. Support will be available from the LLM teaching team as well as the University of Suffolk’s Careers and Enterprise Zone.
Two pathways are anticipated: (a) University of Suffolk research assistant placements for those considering a PhD; and (b) self-initiated placements in relevant organisations in the criminal justice system. Existing professionals will be able to conduct placements with their employers if they choose.
The module is assessed by means of a placement report, requiring scholarly and personal reflection on the placement, as well as a career development portfolio that audits the development of your professional skills, behaviours and competencies, as well as your development needs following your postgraduate study.
Please note that the work placement would be conducted instead of the independent project.

Advisory firms have been quick to herald productivity gains, with PwC estimating AI will add $15.7 trillion to annual global GDP by 2030 – more than today’s entire economy of India[i], while McKinsey & Co triumphantly posits that generative AI alone might contribute $2.6-4.4 trillion annually[ii]. At the same time, economists such as Nobel Prize winner Daron Acemoglu see it adding less than 1% of GDP[iii], and overall AI adoption by firms remains sluggish[iv]. Based on a recent survey, GenAI is used for personal rather than business use, with the most common use being psychological support, meaning and organising one’s life [v].
What should we make of these contrasting estimates? There’s no gainsaying that AI, and GenAI in particular, is making bewildering progress. The technology has yet to be broadly adopted, but business uses of AI are developing at break-neck pace and have the potential to transform how businesses add value.
An uncomfortable truth
So, a revolution is unfolding before our eyes. How should firms adjust? To answer this question, we need to address an uncomfortable truth: AI technical brilliance alone won’t magically transform into productivity, profitability or inclusive growth. Real-world gains hinge on the messy human processes of curating data, reshaping workflows, retraining staff and navigating regulatory hurdles.
Navigating this complex intersection of technology, strategy and policy requires rigorous, independent interdisciplinary research – which is precisely why London Business School (LBS) is establishing the Data Science & AI Institute. It will bring every core business school discipline together under one roof to study and shape AI’s impact on business. The mission is urgent and clear: provide evidence-based insights that help businesses, workers and policymakers translate AI’s promise into tangible benefits for firms, employees and society at large.
We need research that avoids the inescapable temptation of vendors and advisors to furnish optimistic predictions of the future and which documents the opportunities and challenges that AI brings to society. We need a forum that bridges business, policy and academia that can help guide corporate strategy and national policy alike.
Why London Business School?
From its base in London – Europe’s pre-eminent finance and innovation hub – LBS operates on a genuinely global scale, with alumni and research partnerships in more than 150 countries. Its interdisciplinary strength is matched by its proximity to the full spectrum of AI-enabled activity: advanced manufacturing, healthcare, life sciences, government services, creative industries, finance and high-growth tech ventures. London’s dense constellation of venture investors, scale-ups and multinational headquarters gives the Institute a living laboratory; while collaborations across Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia ensure its influence extends far beyond one region. Crucially, the Institute builds on a substantial knowledge base: more than 30% of LBS faculty already conduct research at the intersection of AI and organisations, so it can move rapidly from rigorous analysis to actionable intelligence for companies, workers and policymakers worldwide.
New winners and losers
Consider the nuanced impacts that business school research on AI has uncovered. In a 5,000-agent US call centre, introducing an AI helper boosted productivity 14% overall – but rookies saw gains of 34% while seasoned agents gained nothing; a subtle finding illuminated by business school scholarship on technology and experience[vi]. The results of a well-publicised experiment involving 735 BCG consultants, half of whom had access to ChatGPT and half did not, showed remarkable productivity gains for those using AI for a creative task, with the benefits accruing to those who would struggle without AI, suggesting AI acts as an “exoskeleton” that supports the weakest performers[vii].
But the same study showed that relying on GenAI can mislead in settings where advisors need to analyze a complex strategic question, because the prima facie plausibility of what GenAI offers can belie strategic mistakes. Then again, a field-study analysis of a ChatGPT-powered “mentor” showed significant earnings increases for Kenya’s savviest entrepreneurs, leaving less-skilled peers behind[viii]. Recent research involving software developers using GitHub Copilot highlighted that experienced developers benefitted disproportionately, significantly accelerating their coding tasks[ix]. AI produces new winners and losers.
Business school research is providing evidence on how technology combines with other factors to reshape business. A study that LBS did with the UK Institute of Directors[x] shows that senior business leaders believe that GenAI will disrupt some sectors and business models more than others, emphasising the role of regulation, modularity and proprietary data[xi].
Uneven redistribution
These examples underscore a critical insight: AI is less a simple tool for automation than a force for reallocation. It redistributes productivity and opportunity unevenly; working well in some settings and badly elsewhere – to the benefit of some users and the detriment of others[xii].
There is also a subtle dynamic at play in how AI reshapes employment. Historically, innovations that lowered costs often expanded demand, creating new roles and markets. Research into ATMs showed how they expanded rather than replaced bank jobs[xiii], for example. Similarly, early mechanisation grew rather than shrank worker participation in textile industries; not least because lower costs led to increased demand[xiv]. Today, AI-driven reductions in software development costs do not necessarily eliminate programmer jobs. Instead, they open new markets that were previously economically unviable[xv]. These second-order effects, essential to grasping AI’s true economic impact, have been brought to light primarily through rigorous research done in business schools.
At the organisational level, business school scholarship emphasises that capturing AI’s value rarely depends solely on technical prowess. Instead, firms thrive by leveraging complementary assets – proprietary datasets, trusted brands, regulatory expertise and distribution networks – that researchers have identified as critical moats transforming fleeting algorithmic advantages into sustained economic gains[xvi].
Increasingly, studies conducted in business schools demonstrate the effectiveness of integrated “AI factories” – systems that continually train models, deploy solutions and refine processes[xvii]. Business school research has also clarified when vertical integration, expert-driven solutions and horizontal, employee-led experimentation yield superior outcomes; pinpointing precisely when centralised strategy trumps decentralised innovation[xviii].
Furthermore, business school studies – including pioneering work by our own faculty – highlight that, for firms to master AI integration, industries must collectively orchestrate it. This research shows that the adoption of AI depends on shared standards, interoperable systems and coordinated investments across supply chains[xix]. Through detailed ecosystem studies, including the AI ecosystem that differs between major powers such as the US, China and the EU, business school researchers have documented how industries organising these complementarities reap outsized productivity gains, enhancing competitive positioning globally[xx]. They have also considered the forces that underpin the political economy and geopolitics of AI regulation.[xxi]
Three pillars
Recognising this opportunity, the LBS Institute for Data Science & AI will rest on three pillars:
Research excellence
Uniting experts across business school disciplines – including strategy, finance, economics, marketing, operations and organisational behavior – the Institute will produce robust research examining the implications of AI for businesses and illuminating its impact at every level: workers, firms, industries and regions.
Industry collaboration and policy engagement
Acting as a neutral convener, the Institute will ensure research insights stand the test of real-world application by engaging directly with tech innovators, firms across diverse sectors and regulatory bodies. It will also help catalyse academic knowledge by offering a forum to bridge practitioners and leading researchers.
Educational innovation
The Institute will pioneer AI-driven educational tools, from generative tutors to data-driven simulations, preparing business leaders to strategically, ethically, and adaptively deploy AI. It will also help identify the skills business school students need to compete in a world where GenAI redefines the very purpose of management education[xxii].
Crucially, the Institute eschews rigid blueprints. The epicentre of AI shifts with every technological breakthrough and regulatory update. The mandate is not prediction but measurement – continual, rigorous, public evaluation so businesses and policymakers can steer decisively through the AI revolution.
History clearly shows us that productivity revolutions – from steam to electricity to IT – have hinged not on invention alone, but on adoption and diffusion. Silicon Valley might birth the latest chips and code, but prosperity emerges only in the organisations and regions skilled in their application. By illuminating this path from prototype to profit, the LBS Institute for Data Science & AI will ensure Europe is not merely keeping pace but setting it.

At the same time, economists such as Nobel Prize winner Daron Acemoglu see it adding less than 1% of GDP[iii], and overall AI adoption by firms remains sluggish[iv]. Based on a recent survey, GenAI is used for personal rather than business use, with the most common use being psychological support, meaning and organising one’s life [v].
What should we make of these contrasting estimates? There’s no gainsaying that AI, and GenAI in particular, is making bewildering progress. The technology has yet to be broadly adopted, but business uses of AI are developing at break-neck pace and have the potential to transform how businesses add value.
An uncomfortable truth
So, a revolution is unfolding before our eyes. How should firms adjust? To answer this question, we need to address an uncomfortable truth: AI technical brilliance alone won’t magically transform into productivity, profitability or inclusive growth. Real-world gains hinge on the messy human processes of curating data, reshaping workflows, retraining staff and navigating regulatory hurdles.
Navigating this complex intersection of technology, strategy and policy requires rigorous, independent interdisciplinary research – which is precisely why London Business School (LBS) is establishing the Data Science & AI Institute. It will bring every core business school discipline together under one roof to study and shape AI’s impact on business. The mission is urgent and clear: provide evidence-based insights that help businesses, workers and policymakers translate AI’s promise into tangible benefits for firms, employees and society at large.
We need research that avoids the inescapable temptation of vendors and advisors to furnish optimistic predictions of the future and which documents the opportunities and challenges that AI brings to society. We need a forum that bridges business, policy and academia that can help guide corporate strategy and national policy alike.
Why London Business School?
From its base in London – Europe’s pre-eminent finance and innovation hub – LBS operates on a genuinely global scale, with alumni and research partnerships in more than 150 countries. Its interdisciplinary strength is matched by its proximity to the full spectrum of AI-enabled activity: advanced manufacturing, healthcare, life sciences, government services, creative industries, finance and high-growth tech ventures. London’s dense constellation of venture investors, scale-ups and multinational headquarters gives the Institute a living laboratory; while collaborations across Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia ensure its influence extends far beyond one region. Crucially, the Institute builds on a substantial knowledge base: more than 30% of LBS faculty already conduct research at the intersection of AI and organisations, so it can move rapidly from rigorous analysis to actionable intelligence for companies, workers and policymakers worldwide.
New winners and losers
Consider the nuanced impacts that business school research on AI has uncovered. In a 5,000-agent US call centre, introducing an AI helper boosted productivity 14% overall – but rookies saw gains of 34% while seasoned agents gained nothing; a subtle finding illuminated by business school scholarship on technology and experience[vi]. The results of a well-publicised experiment involving 735 BCG consultants, half of whom had access to ChatGPT and half did not, showed remarkable productivity gains for those using AI for a creative task, with the benefits accruing to those who would struggle without AI, suggesting AI acts as an “exoskeleton” that supports the weakest performers[vii].
But the same study showed that relying on GenAI can mislead in settings where advisors need to analyze a complex strategic question, because the prima facie plausibility of what GenAI offers can belie strategic mistakes. Then again, a field-study analysis of a ChatGPT-powered “mentor” showed significant earnings increases for Kenya’s savviest entrepreneurs, leaving less-skilled peers behind[viii]. Recent research involving software developers using GitHub Copilot highlighted that experienced developers benefitted disproportionately, significantly accelerating their coding tasks[ix]. AI produces new winners and losers.
Business school research is providing evidence on how technology combines with other factors to reshape business. A study that LBS did with the UK Institute of Directors[x] shows that senior business leaders believe that GenAI will disrupt some sectors and business models more than others, emphasising the role of regulation, modularity and proprietary data[xi].
Uneven redistribution
These examples underscore a critical insight: AI is less a simple tool for automation than a force for reallocation. It redistributes productivity and opportunity unevenly; working well in some settings and badly elsewhere – to the benefit of some users and the detriment of others[xii].
There is also a subtle dynamic at play in how AI reshapes employment. Historically, innovations that lowered costs often expanded demand, creating new roles and markets. Research into ATMs showed how they expanded rather than replaced bank jobs[xiii], for example. Similarly, early mechanisation grew rather than shrank worker participation in textile industries; not least because lower costs led to increased demand[xiv]. Today, AI-driven reductions in software development costs do not necessarily eliminate programmer jobs. Instead, they open new markets that were previously economically unviable[xv]. These second-order effects, essential to grasping AI’s true economic impact, have been brought to light primarily through rigorous research done in business schools.
At the organisational level, business school scholarship emphasises that capturing AI’s value rarely depends solely on technical prowess. Instead, firms thrive by leveraging complementary assets – proprietary datasets, trusted brands, regulatory expertise and distribution networks – that researchers have identified as critical moats transforming fleeting algorithmic advantages into sustained economic gains[xvi].
Increasingly, studies conducted in business schools demonstrate the effectiveness of integrated “AI factories” – systems that continually train models, deploy solutions and refine processes[xvii]. Business school research has also clarified when vertical integration, expert-driven solutions and horizontal, employee-led experimentation yield superior outcomes; pinpointing precisely when centralised strategy trumps decentralised innovation[xviii].
Furthermore, business school studies – including pioneering work by our own faculty – highlight that, for firms to master AI integration, industries must collectively orchestrate it. This research shows that the adoption of AI depends on shared standards, interoperable systems and coordinated investments across supply chains[xix]. Through detailed ecosystem studies, including the AI ecosystem that differs between major powers such as the US, China and the EU, business school researchers have documented how industries organising these complementarities reap outsized productivity gains, enhancing competitive positioning globally[xx]. They have also considered the forces that underpin the political economy and geopolitics of AI regulation.[xxi]
Three pillars
Recognising this opportunity, the LBS Institute for Data Science & AI will rest on three pillars:
Research excellence
Uniting experts across business school disciplines – including strategy, finance, economics, marketing, operations and organisational behavior – the Institute will produce robust research examining the implications of AI for businesses and illuminating its impact at every level: workers, firms, industries and regions.
Industry collaboration and policy engagement
Acting as a neutral convener, the Institute will ensure research insights stand the test of real-world application by engaging directly with tech innovators, firms across diverse sectors and regulatory bodies. It will also help catalyse academic knowledge by offering a forum to bridge practitioners and leading researchers.
Educational innovation
The Institute will pioneer AI-driven educational tools, from generative tutors to data-driven simulations, preparing business leaders to strategically, ethically, and adaptively deploy AI. It will also help identify the skills business school students need to compete in a world where GenAI redefines the very purpose of management education[xxii].
Crucially, the Institute eschews rigid blueprints. The epicentre of AI shifts with every technological breakthrough and regulatory update. The mandate is not prediction but measurement – continual, rigorous, public evaluation so businesses and policymakers can steer decisively through the AI revolution.
History clearly shows us that productivity revolutions – from steam to electricity to IT – have hinged not on invention alone, but on adoption and diffusion. Silicon Valley might birth the latest chips and code, but prosperity emerges only in the organisations and regions skilled in their application. By illuminating this path from prototype to profit, the LBS Institute for Data Science & AI will ensure Europe is not merely keeping pace but setting it.

Date 10.06.2020
10.06.2020Third year student, Chloe Moller, shares her thoughts as she nears the end of her undergraduate law degree at the University of Northampton.
It has come to the end of my degree, and after three years of studying at, and living In, Northampton there is an abundance to reflect upon. I have chosen four elements of my academic life that I wish I had known more about.
Dissertations
To those of you who are going into your final year in September, you will have recently been asked to start thinking about your dissertation. There is a great deal of stigma surrounding dissertations; many of us establish a presumption that our dissertation will be stressful and time consuming. Rest assured this is not the case, while at times you may feel stressed, it passes! Whether you choose the five-thousand-word dissertation or the ten-thousand-word dissertation, it is likely to be the greatest number of words you have written as an assessment piece while at university. But it is important to remember that you usually have from September until March to complete it; this allows you to break down the time you spend on your dissertation to fit it in with your other modules. It really is not as daunting and stressful as it might seem.
As you will know by now, subject to availability you can pick which supervisor is best suited to what you want to explore; in fact, you are quite spoilt for choice in that respect. It can seem daunting when it comes to making the decision as to what legal element, you wish to write about it.
When making my decision, I knew from the get-go that I wanted to focus on European Union Law (much to everybody’s disgust) but I was not fully set on this decision, as I thought I may like to write about Contempt of Court (Human Rights). My advice, if you’re in a similar situation, is to choose a supervisor who covers both of the areas you’re interested in-see if you can discuss your ideas with them but you must remember your chosen supervisor cannot make the decision for you. Like any assessment, it is a good starting point to have a plan; at this stage you do not need an in-depth plan of what you want your dissertation to cover, but you could make a mind map etc to establish what you might wish to write about if you’re lost. It is also a good idea to see what sources are available, this will enable you to explore specific elements of your desired area but will also add to you research.
I think a lot of people forget that your dissertation allows you to evaluate and explore any element of the law that you are interested in. Your dissertation is something for you to enjoy and be fascinated with. Embrace it! This is the best way to write it.
Postgraduate Pathway
Some of you may be aware of what comes next after your law degree, but it is okay not to know. There are three main routes you can follow if you want to go specifically down a legal pathway, obviously you can do anything after your degree and you shouldn’t feel pressured to go into a legal career just because you’ve studied the degree.
There are two key aspects to remember with any legal postgraduate course: funding and time. You do not have to go straight from your undergraduate degree into a postgraduate, you can take however much time out you feel necessary before moving onto the next stage. If you use student finance, you can apply for a postgraduate fund. Unlike your undergraduate finance, it is not spilt into maintenance and course fees; you will receive one loan only, and it goes directly to your bank account. The loan available currently is £11,222. Although funding should not be the determining factor as to which postgraduate degree you want to study, it is something you really need to consider when establishing how you are to cover the fees of living and studying.
The courses available:
LLM: An LLM is short for a Legal Masters. Upon your research, you will find there is a wide range of choice in university providers offering the LLM. One of which is Northampton, where you can pick between one of two LLM courses and this would be offered to you at a discounted fee (20% discount) as you have studied your undergraduate at Northampton. LLM’s are notably cheaper than any of the other postgraduate courses, but do not let this influence your decision.
LPC: The LPC is short for the Legal Practice Course. If you aspire to qualify as a solicitor, you will need to eventually enrol onto this course. You can do this course in three different time periods: you can complete the course in six months, nine months, or two years. If you apply for a training contract prior to applying to a university for you LPC, and you are successful your firm may dictate what university you go to and the length of your course. Albeit, this usually occurs when the firm have agreed to pay for your LPC. Unlike the LLM, the LPC is considerably more expensive, the price differs depending where you choose to study, but it generally ranges from £10,000-£16,765. Like choosing your undergraduate university, it is a good idea to visit and research some of the providers. Although Coronavirus is currently preventing physical visits, many of the universities offer virtual tours and information sessions online. The other element to consider is combing two components of postgraduate study. I will be starting a combined course of the LLM and LPC at BPP University Holborn campus, come September. By combining the two you can qualify for student finance and obviously gain an additional qualification to your name.
BPTC/BPC: This previously stood for the Bar Professional Training Course but has recently changed to the Bar Practice Course. You will need to enrol on this course if you wish to proceed down the Barrister pathway. Out of the three postgraduate legal pathways, the BPC is the most expensive-once again the price differs from where in the country you choose to study. To study the BPC in London on average will cost between £16,000-£19,500, outside of London the fees are less. Like the LPC you can choose to study the course with LLM which will allow you to apply for postgraduate funding through student finance. There are many scholarships available for the BPC and I would advise visiting any of the Inns for further information and to find out how they might be able to support your journey as a barrister.
Legal and non-legal opportunities
Which ever route you decide to go down, you will often be asked about what legal experiences you have encountered or participated in. Throughout the year the university holds many opportunities for you to enhance you legal experiences, you should try to go to as many of these as you possibly can as they will be great talking points in applications and interviews to come. Obviously, the events might not stay the same year on year but examples of what the university has previously offered include law fairs, guest speakers and formal dinners at one of the Inns. From personal experience, I would advise that you try and go to each one at least once; also, keep an eye out for vacation schemes and insight days as these too are great in enhancing your legal experience.
It is important to not purely focus your time at university on just law related aspects; the Students’ Union at the university offers many free sports and societies to join. It is a great way of boosting your confidence, meeting new people or just for taking a break away from the academic side of university. During my time at Northampton I joined the Women’s first team for Lacrosse. Playing games for your university is an amazing experience and you will unleash a whole new passion and love for the university you did not realise you had. But if sports is not your thing, then I would definitely recommend trying out any of the other societies.
Good luck in your studies and goodbye to Northampton, I will miss you dearly.",2415,,University of Northampton,17.6,,10145,2415,northampton.ac.uk,,0:00,,,United Kingdom,"media, news",4.405953649415921,0.4139167862266858,1400,False,2415,"Student Blog: Studying Law at Northampton | UON

VIEWPOINT: New discoveries could help drive forward the technologies of the future
By Domenico Vicinanza, Anglia Ruskin University
From the bronze age to the Industrial Revolution and beyond, the discovery and development of new materials has been a driving force in human history. These novel materials have helped advance technology and shape civilisations.
Today, we are at the beginning of a new era, where artificial intelligence (AI) seems to be in the perfect position to transform the search for useful materials. This looks set to completely change the approach to their investigation, creation and testing.
In ancient times, human civilisations experimented with natural resources to create tools and artifacts. The bronze age, in the mid-4th millennium BC, was a significant milestone. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, led to the development of stronger tools and weapons, as well as advancements in agriculture and construction.
Bronze is often referred to as the first “new material” created by humans. We took different elements and created something new, with better properties than either ingredient and unique qualities. The invention of glass in ancient Mesopotamia around 3,500BC was another groundbreaking moment.
Fast forward to the 20th century and the discovery of plastic polymers, ceramics and superconductors opened new frontiers in technology. Ceramics, known for their durability and heat resistance, became a staple in industries from aerospace to electronics.
Superconductors, materials that can conduct electricity with zero electrical resistance, are already used in maglevs (magnetic levitation trains), particle accelerators and medical devices.
AI enters the fray
Searching for new materials that could help drive the development of the next groundbreaking technologies has previously been a long and expensive process. This has been due to the complexity of many materials at the atomic and molecular levels. Traditional methods are essentially based on trial and error and need specialised equipment and resources.
The inherent uncertainty and risk in material discovery further complicates and lengthens the process. However, advancements in AI, including in a subset of AI called machine learning, are beginning to transform the whole landscape, enabling more efficient and targeted approaches. In machine learning, mathematical rules called algorithms learn from data to improve at tasks without human intervention.
The main shift is a new methodology based on “generative” AI systems, which can create new content. AI systems can now directly produce novel materials when provided with desired properties and constraints.
Earlier this year, a team at Microsoft published a paper in Nature that introduced a pair of AI tools for the design of inorganic materials (those not based around the element carbon).
These tools play complementary roles in materials discovery. They are called MatterGen and MatterSim. The first one creates new candidate materials, and the second filters and validates them – to ensure they could be made in the real world.
The specific desired properties that can be incorporated through MatterGen include a specific symmetry, or mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties.
Unlike traditional methods that mostly rely on intuition (along with extensive and tedious experimentation), MatterGen can generate thousands of potential materials with specific desired properties in a fraction of the time.
This AI-led approach accelerates the initial stages of material design. It allows researchers to explore a broader range of possibilities and focus on the most promising candidates.
MatterSim applies rigorous computer analysis to predict the stability and viability of these proposed materials. This predictive capability helps filter out theoretical possibilities from physically feasible ones. This ensures that only stable materials move forward in the discovery process.
New tools in the box
At this point, we might wonder, what does a new material, identified through this process, look like? MatterSim is mostly focusing on crystals, or more appropriately unique crystalline structures with a specific arrangement of atoms.
These structures are tailored to meet precise property constraints, making them suitable for various applications. These include high energy batteries, flexible electronics, displays, solar panels or advanced medical implants.
Microsoft’s powerful duo, however, is not alone in its quest. Google DeepMind’s Graph Networks for Materials Exploration (Gnome) is another tool promising to dramatically speed up the discovery process. Gnome uses a form of AI that’s inspired by the human brain called deep learning. It predicts the stability of new materials, significantly shortening the exploration and discovery phase.
In a paper published in 2023, researchers from Google DeepMind demonstrated that their AI model could identify 2.2 million new stable materials. Some 736 of these have already been experimentally realised. This is a tenfold increase over previous methods. These materials, many of which were previously unknown to human chemists, have potential applications in clean energy, electronics, and more.
Even if both Google’s Gnome and Microsoft’s MatterGen are AI-based, they differ in their approaches and, in some ways, provide complementary methodologies. Gnome predicts the stability of new materials by creating variations on existing structures, and it focuses on identifying stable crystalline materials.
MatterGen, on the other hand, employs a generative AI model to directly engineer novel materials based on specific design requirements. It creates material structures by changing elements, positions and periodic lattices (a repeating structure in three dimensions).
The implications of AI-driven material discovery are vast. They could potentially lead to innovations in fields such as energy storage and environmental sustainability. One of the most promising applications is the development of new batteries.
As the world makes the transition to renewable energy sources, the demand for efficient, long lasting batteries has grown and will continue to do so. AI tools can help researchers design and identify new materials able to support higher energy densities, faster charging times and longer lifespans.
Beyond energy storage, new materials can be used to design new medical devices, implants and even drug delivery systems. This could improve patient outcomes and advance medical treatments.
In aerospace, lightweight, durable materials could enhance the performance and safety of aircraft and spacecraft. Meanwhile, new materials for water purification, carbon capture, and waste management could address pressing environmental challenges.

However, advancements in AI, including in a subset of AI called machine learning, are beginning to transform the whole landscape, enabling more efficient and targeted approaches. In machine learning, mathematical rules called algorithms learn from data to improve at tasks without human intervention.
The main shift is a new methodology based on “generative” AI systems, which can create new content. AI systems can now directly produce novel materials when provided with desired properties and constraints.
Earlier this year, a team at Microsoft published a paper in Nature that introduced a pair of AI tools for the design of inorganic materials (those not based around the element carbon).
These tools play complementary roles in materials discovery. They are called MatterGen and MatterSim. The first one creates new candidate materials, and the second filters and validates them – to ensure they could be made in the real world.
The specific desired properties that can be incorporated through MatterGen include a specific symmetry, or mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties.
Unlike traditional methods that mostly rely on intuition (along with extensive and tedious experimentation), MatterGen can generate thousands of potential materials with specific desired properties in a fraction of the time.
This AI-led approach accelerates the initial stages of material design. It allows researchers to explore a broader range of possibilities and focus on the most promising candidates.
MatterSim applies rigorous computer analysis to predict the stability and viability of these proposed materials. This predictive capability helps filter out theoretical possibilities from physically feasible ones. This ensures that only stable materials move forward in the discovery process.
New tools in the box
At this point, we might wonder, what does a new material, identified through this process, look like? MatterSim is mostly focusing on crystals, or more appropriately unique crystalline structures with a specific arrangement of atoms.
These structures are tailored to meet precise property constraints, making them suitable for various applications. These include high energy batteries, flexible electronics, displays, solar panels or advanced medical implants.
Microsoft’s powerful duo, however, is not alone in its quest. Google DeepMind’s Graph Networks for Materials Exploration (Gnome) is another tool promising to dramatically speed up the discovery process. Gnome uses a form of AI that’s inspired by the human brain called deep learning. It predicts the stability of new materials, significantly shortening the exploration and discovery phase.
In a paper published in 2023, researchers from Google DeepMind demonstrated that their AI model could identify 2.2 million new stable materials. Some 736 of these have already been experimentally realised. This is a tenfold increase over previous methods. These materials, many of which were previously unknown to human chemists, have potential applications in clean energy, electronics, and more.
Even if both Google’s Gnome and Microsoft’s MatterGen are AI-based, they differ in their approaches and, in some ways, provide complementary methodologies. Gnome predicts the stability of new materials by creating variations on existing structures, and it focuses on identifying stable crystalline materials.
MatterGen, on the other hand, employs a generative AI model to directly engineer novel materials based on specific design requirements. It creates material structures by changing elements, positions and periodic lattices (a repeating structure in three dimensions).
The implications of AI-driven material discovery are vast. They could potentially lead to innovations in fields such as energy storage and environmental sustainability. One of the most promising applications is the development of new batteries.
As the world makes the transition to renewable energy sources, the demand for efficient, long lasting batteries has grown and will continue to do so. AI tools can help researchers design and identify new materials able to support higher energy densities, faster charging times and longer lifespans.
Beyond energy storage, new materials can be used to design new medical devices, implants and even drug delivery systems. This could improve patient outcomes and advance medical treatments.
In aerospace, lightweight, durable materials could enhance the performance and safety of aircraft and spacecraft. Meanwhile, new materials for water purification, carbon capture, and waste management could address pressing environmental challenges.

How can you determine if a multi-trillion-dollar economic powerhouse, which has little to no obligation to offer public disclosure of its practices, benefits the planet, its stakeholders, or its investors? Moreover, how can you discern whether the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) information that the industry voluntarily discloses is genuine or mere window dressing? Finally, how can you assess private equity's impact on the ESG performance of its portfolio companies?
One approach to addressing these questions is to examine the information that private equity firms choose to disclose on their websites. Valuable insights can be gained by analysing a representative sample of thousands of firms and comparing the practices of those that make extensive ESG disclosures with those that provide limited information.
In a newly published paper titled ""ESG Disclosures in the Private Equity Industry,"" authored by Florin Vasvari, Marcel Olbert, and Jefferson Abraham of the London Business School, the authors aim to do just that.
Photo: Marcel Olbert, Jefferson Abraham and Florin Vasvari discuss their new research
The trio provide the first systematic empirical insights into ESG disclosures by private equity firms, drawing from a representative sample of over 5,400 private equity firms. Their research seeks to explore the primary factors influencing a private equity firm's decision to disclose ESG-related information and to determine whether portfolio companies' ESG performance shows greater improvement after investments by firms with a strong ESG disclosure track record, compared to firms that disclose less.
To conduct their research, the team developed a novel yet straightforward measure of ESG disclosure using data from private equity firms' websites spanning from 2000 to 2022. They combined this information with data from the specialist data provider Preqin and data on portfolio company performance from publicly available sources such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory (EPA-TRI), U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and other sources like S&P Global's Trucost database.
Their ESG measure was constructed through textual analysis, utilising a dictionary of ESG-related words sourced from various references, including the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment. Additionally, the ESG measure's validity was confirmed using the ChatGPT large language model to provide context regarding the nature of ESG disclosures made by private equity firms.
The study reveals a significant increase in ESG disclosures over the past two decades. While overall content on private equity firms' websites has expanded, the prominence of ESG-related messaging has consistently risen. This stands in contrast to disclosures about financial value creation, which have gradually decreased in relative importance.
Geography and the primary industries of portfolio companies are significant factors influencing the variation in ESG disclosures among private equity firms. ESG disclosures have grown at a faster pace in Europe compared to the United States, particularly in industries with higher environmental risks.
Investor perspectives also play a crucial role. The study demonstrates that the presence of ESG-aligned investors, known as limited partners in the private equity industry, drives ESG disclosures by PE firms. Following an investment by a limited partner committed to the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investing, website-level ESG disclosures increased by approximately 12%. The study also explores the potential influence of spillover effects from ESG disclosure mandates in public markets, which motivates private equity firms to enhance their ESG disclosures, especially when their portfolio companies operate in jurisdictions with robust public ESG reporting requirements.",2333,,London Business School,20.2,,2125,2333,london.edu,,0:00,,,United Kingdom,"research materials, media",4.515858111021866,0.5536028119507909,568,False,2333,"Keeping an eye on private equity and ESG | London Business School

Children, Cities and Climate aims to understand and communicate young people’s views of their cities and assess the public health co-benefits of improving urban environments.
The nexus of climate change, cities and child health is critical for the future of people and the planet. The Children, Cities and Climate Action Lab aims to address the interconnected challenges of averting climate breakdown; leveraging the central role of cities in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving human health; and analysing the child health co-benefits of improving the quality of urban environments. This project is led by LSHTM in collaboration with YLabs, C40 and UrbanBetter.
Children, Cities and Climate provides new evidence on the potential co-benefits to child and adolescent health of improving urban environments, starting with air quality. In parallel, through an online survey and public engagement activities, the project aims to understand young people’s views about their cities and communicate their vision for healthy, sustainable cities of the future.

The Children, Cities and Climate Action Lab is a global initiative focused on re-envisioning public health and the role of academia amidst the climate crisis, focusing on three key themes: Children, Cities, and Climate.
The nexus of climate change, cities and child health is critical for the future of people and the planet. Across the world, children and young people are among those worst affected by climate change, with air pollution, food insecurity and water scarcity in urban environments having significant negative consequences on their health.
Over 30% of the 4 billion people currently living in cities today are children and this proportion will rise to 70% of 6.7 billion urban dwellers by 2050. Cities are currently a major driver of the climate crisis, being responsible for an estimated 70% of carbon emissions. Evidence-informed and accessible tools are needed to design cities that enable children and young people to live healthily and sustainably in the future.
The Children, Cities and Climate Action Lab (CCC) aims to address three interconnected challenges: tackling the climate crisis; leveraging the central role of cities in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and improving child and adolescent health; and producing and communicating new scientific evidence on the public health co-benefits of reducing emissions for children and young people.
Young people have a key role to play in driving forward bold and urgent action to decarbonise economies and design sustainable, healthy cities. Through an online survey and public engagement activities, the first phase of the project focused on understanding young people’s views about their cities, elevating their voices and equipping them with the latest scientific evidence on the positive impact of improving urban environments on child and adolescent health. A CCC-led modelling study revealed that more than 20,000 cases of childhood asthma, over 43,000 premature births, and over 22,000 low birthweight births could be averted annually across 16 cities if air pollution reduced to net-zero levels. In parallel to this, the project surveyed over 3,000 young people (aged 13-25), parents of younger children and expectant parents from 59 cities around the world, and carried out a wide range of youth and public engagement activities to understand and communicate the view of young people about their cities and the future.
The CCC presented preliminary research findings at COY16, the youth climate conference, and COP26 in Glasgow, and carried out workshops at COP27 and COP28, providing a window of opportunity for engaging with policymakers and policy-engaged audiences in this area.
The second phase of the project aims to put the health gains that decarbonisation of cities can offer to children and young people at the centre of urban policymaking, predominantly across the Global South, and to support this with informed policy engagement and advocacy in collaboration with partner organisations: YLabs, C40 and UrbanBetter. Led by LSHTM, the CCC seeks to identify and support implementation of solutions for decarbonising cities and improving the health of children and young people worldwide.

Youth engagement is central to the Children, Cities and Climate initiative. Our research is not just about young people, but with and for young people. Below are some examples of public engagement activities that we have carried out and the creative contributions from young people living in cities around the world.
Phase 1 activities
- Art of Health Breathe In
The Art of Health competition is a crowdsourcing competition in Zimbabwe run by the Zimbabwe LSHTM Research Partnership. The initiative aims to engage young people with issues relating to health and wellbeing through the creative arts. The Art of Health Breathe In competition was a new element of the initiative and the result of collaboration between the Art of Health and Children, Cities and Climate teams.
The competition was divided into two main categories – music and design - and participants were asked to share entries on the theme “The air we breathe in Zimbabwe’s cities”. They were asked to express, through their chosen medium, how they feel about the cities they live in, the air they breathe and the benefits that clean air could bring to health.
- Youth Voices Video
We asked young people around the world to share their thoughts, feelings and messages for world leaders on healthy and unhealthy cities. The air we breathe in our cities: Clean air, brighter futures was produced in the run up to COP26 and will be presented at the conference, with the aim of elevating youth voices and sharing their creative, ambitious vision for healthy, sustainable cities of the future.
- Young Scientists Programme workshop
As part of the LSHTM Young Scientists Programme, the Children, Cities and Climate team ran a three-day workshop on climate, health, urban air pollution and other themes relating to the research. The students, who joined from different schools around London, designed their own research projects in pairs using air quality sensors and presented their findings at the end of the workshop.
- Youth Engagement Campaign in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
Between August and December 2021, Shujaaz Inc. in partnership with the Children, Cities and Climate team, led a youth engagement campaign in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
The campaign’s aim was to share preliminary research findings and engage young people with the intersection of climate change, cities and health through social media content and an online event.
The campaign reached a total of 842.3K young people in Kenya and Tanzania, with over 50,000 deep engagements and reactions (likes, comments, shares) within the 2-week period.
Read the report on the campaign.
Phase 2 activities
- Art of Health Heating Up
The Art of Health competition is a crowdsourcing competition in Zimbabwe run by the Zimbabwe-LSHTM Research Group. The initiative aims to effectively engage young people with issues relating to health and wellbeing through the creative arts. The Art of Health Heating Up competition was the second collaboration between the Art of Health and Children, Cities and Climate project teams, after the Art Of Health Breathe In competition (see above).
Young people living in Zimbabwe's cities were asked to show through art or photography how their life and health have been affected by heat, heatwaves or drought, and to show the benefits that climate action can bring to their health and well-being.
- Nairobi co-design workshop
Ahead of COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, parents of babies and young children living in Nairobi took part in a healthy cities co-design workshop, coordinated by YLabs as part of the Children, Cities and Climate Action Lab.
During the workshops, parents shared their experiences of living in a warming urban environment and their concerns about the effects of heat and air pollution on the health of their children. They also had ideas and hopes about what could be done to improve their cities for their children and create a healthier, more sustainable future.
- Art of Health Ideal Urban Futures
The Art of Health held its third competition in collaboration with the Centre on Climate Change & Planetary Health and the Children, Cities and Climate Action Lab (CCC) at LSHTM, as well as Fondation Botnar, the Bernard van Leer Foundation, Ardent Creative and THRU ZIM (The Health Research Unit Zimbabwe, research partner of LSHTM) at the Biomedical Research and Training Institute.
The competition asked for art, design and photography submissions and supporting statements from young people (aged 13-35) to answer the following questions: how have your health and wellbeing been affected by climate change, what are the solutions to the impacts of climate change in your city, and what does an 'ideal urban future' look like to you?
The winning entry was from Toleukhan Madina, aged 16 from Kazakhstan:
Her supporting statement says, ""My painting predicts the future of humanity. This personifies the consequences of human irresponsibility and indifference to climate change and the deterioration of nature"".
Second place was awarded to Nyasha Gurure, aged 28 from Zimbabwe:
She says ""We are connected to the environment that we live in. In this art piece, I endeavour to capture the profund impact of climate change on our human roots and mental well-being. The parched ground symbolises the arid effect of environmental degradation, on my sense of stability and adaptability. It mirrors the challenges I face in adjusting to plans and business endeavours amidst an increasingly unpredictable climate. I depict myself as feeling akin to the dry, cracked earth, experiencing the weight of mental strain and an uncertain future. However, amidst this adversity, a resilient hope for a stable, flourishing tomorrow endures within me. It manifests as an aspiration for rich soils and sturdy structures, representing a longing for a more sustainable and secure world. As the artist, I take on the mantle of responsibility, bearing the weight for a better tomorrow. Each brushstroke and texture serves as a testament to the resilience and determination needed to navigate these challenging times. Through this piece, I convey the struggle, the hope, and the commitment to fostering a future that stands firm and fruitful, a future nurtured through our collective conscientious actions"".
Third place was awarded to Dada Nifemi Emmanuel, aged 16 from Nigeria:
In his supporting statement, Dada said, ""This piece of art richly captures the main theme of 'Addressing the effects of climate change'. This process requires a multifaceted approach. As conveyed through this piece depicting how healthy flow of water and nature from the vision gadget into her present reality, the present reality in this piece is feeling the adverse effect of climate change already in the dryness of the soil leaving it unfit for crops and plants, which will definitely lead to a greater effect of starvation and hunger globally. This outpouring of nature represents sustainable practices, transitioning to nature friendly policy that ensures the revival of natural advancing environmental policies and regulations, encouraging industries to adopt eco-friendly practices. The woman depicted in this piece serves as a representative of the first teacher of a nation; they represent public awareness campaigns, which are pivotal in promoting responsible consumption and reducing waste. Preservation of wildlife was represented by the animal characters in this piece. International collaboration is crucial to combat the global nature of climate change - nations working together to set and achieve ambitious emissions reductions targets. The woman's consistency was vividly captured as she continues to invest in more enlightenment and burning the midnight candle to ensure the current limitations are no longer relevant in providing solutions. This captures the concept of investing in climate resilience measures, such as improved infrastructure and early warning systems, helping communities adapt to changing climatic conditions. Education and empowerment for individuals to make environmentally conscious choices, fostering a collective commitment to a sustainable future. By combining technological innovation, policy reforms, and grassroots initatives, we can effectively address the effects of climate change and create a resilient, environmentally sustainable world."".

The CCC Action Lab final report (pdf) captures the activities, outcomes and lessons from phases 2 and 3 of the hildren & Young People, Cities and Climate (CCC) Action Lab in Lagos and Nairobi up to February 2025. It highlights how youth participants implemented and refined their advocacy strategies to tackle air pollution and promote healthier urban environments, supported by training, mentoring, and collaboration with city officials. The report also documents key challenges, impact metrics, and best practices for scaling youth-led climate advocacy.
Phase 2 was carried out online immediately after phase 1 (outlined in the first report). Phases 1 and 3 were in-person and the co-design sessions were led by our partner Ylabs.
The CCC Action Lab first report (pdf) outlines stage one of phase three of the Children & Young People, Cities and Climate (CCC) Action Lab, detailing youth-led co-design workshops in Lagos and Nairobi from February 2024. It highlights key insights, advocacy strategies, and lessons learned from engaging 47 young people in developing local climate solutions focused on air pollution and urban resilience.
On Friday 8 November, partners of the Children, Cities and Climate (CCC) Action Lab (The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, YLabs, C40 and UrbanBetter) will host a hybrid event at the World Urban Forum in Cairo.
This event will gather city planners, environmental experts, young people, and policymakers to exchange ideas and co-design ideal urban futures that are adaptable to climate challenges, and cater to the younger generation.
Building on the work of the CCC Action Lab, the event will include presentations about current research and projects, complemented by discussions that are both youth-facilitated and expert-informed. The event aims to co-create visions for healthier and more sustainable urban futures, emphasising young people’s critical role in shaping them.
Session panelists will include Constance Bwire, Research Fellow in the CCC Action Lab at LSHTM, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, C40 Co-Chair and Mayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone, Fithriyyah Iskandar MD, Member of the CCC Action Lab Youth Advisory Group, and Dr Jana Alagarajah, Technical Lead at YLabs.
The event will also showcase the ongoing work of the youth led advocacy campaigns from two groups in Lagos and Nairobi, which aim to advance local policy change and ensure youth representation in decisions.
It will amplify the lived experiences of youth in climate-impacted cities and mark a significant move towards a youth-led sustainable future.
Join us at 11:00 - 12:30 GMT online or in person at the World Urban Forum in Cairo, in Multipurpose Room 6.

The second phase of the Children, Cities & Climate Action Lab (CCC) aims to identify and support the implementation of solutions that decarbonise cities and improve the health of children and young people worldwide. As part of this work, earlier this year the CCC brought together 47 young people across two workshops hosted in Lagos and Nairobi to address climate change-related issues in their cities.
The workshops had three primary objectives: to capture young people’s visions, hopes and ambitions for change in Lagos and Nairobi, focusing on health, climate-resilient and safe cities for children and young people; enable participants to develop advocacy strategies to generate policies, and test them over the following 12 months; and train young people in climate action through policy and advocacy.
In the wake of International Youth Day on the 12 August, which seeks to bring youth issues to the forefront and celebrate the inclusion of youth voices in global decisions, the CCC reflects on these workshops.
The workshops involved a week-long in-person training in Lagos and Nairobi. YLabs, a partner of the CCC, led the participants through four key activities aiming to involve young people in meaningful discussions about urban climate action, equip them with the tools and knowledge to develop and implement effective climate advocacy strategies, and create a platform for networking and collaboration between youth climate leaders and key stakeholders, such as city officials who were also in attendance. Creative mixed methods including visions boards, visual mapping, and photo sharing were used to discuss root causes of climate-related issues and to collectively imagine healthy, safe and resilient cities.
The activities revealed the complex factors behind climate-related issues such as air pollution, and those disproportionately impacted by it. Participants recognised the need for tailored interventions based on local contexts, and underscored the importance of community engagement and youth involvement in addressing environmental challenges.
The participants then formed groups to develop advocacy strategies using learnings from the activities alongside guidance of key principles in advocacy design. Four key strategy areas emerged across the two cities: transportation, with a focus on reducing emissions from fuel-based vehicles; reducing pollution from waste burning and improper waste management; advocacy communication to drive policy and behavioural change; and transitioning to green energy and sustainable transportation.
In the next phase of the programme, the groups are now working together to develop, test and implement their advocacy strategies over 12 months, with the help of monthly virtual training sessions and meetings, and interactive digital learning content. Participants recently came together half way through the year to share their progress and receive feedback to advance their strategies, and practice their pitching skills to a panel of experts. The final phase of this work will involve reflective learning and identify future challenges for participants to tackle in the coming years.
Co-developing visions of future climate-resilient cities with young people, and providing them with ownership of climate advocacy campaigns is central to the success of this work. By engaging young local facilitators, recruiting knowledgeable youth leaders, and involving city environmental officers, these workshops were able to foster new relationships and enable knowledge sharing. International Youth Day raises awareness of the issues facing youths, and celebrates the inclusion of youth as partners in global society, two aspects underpinning the goals of the CCC Action Lab, and engagement with youth through workshops such as these.
Earlier this year, the Art of Health held a competition in collaboration with the Centre on Climate Change & Planetary Health and the Children, the Children, Cities and Climate (CCC) Action Lab at LSHTM, Fondation Botnar, the Bernard van Leer Foundation, Ardent Creative and THRU ZIM (The Health Research Unit Zimbabwe, research partner of LSHTM) at the Biomedical Research and Training Institute. The competition was asking for art, design and photography submissions from young people (aged 13-35) to answer the following questions: How have your health and wellbeing been affected by climate change? What are the solutions to the effects of climate in your city? And what does an ‘ideal urban future’ look like to you?
This marks the third collaboration between the CCC and the Art of Health, following two other competitions called ‘Breathe In’ and ‘Heating Up’. These competitions have engaged adolescents to express the effects of climate change on their health and wellbeing and suggest solutions to the challenges they are experiencing.
We received 162 submissions from 32 countries – the majority from Africa and Asia. A panel of judges representing the partners and previous competition winners assembled to select top three winners from a shortlist of 16 entries.
The winning entry for the Ideal Urban Futures Competition was by Toleukhan Madina, aged 16 from Kazakhstan:
In her supporting statement, Toleukhan said, ""My painting predicts the future of humanity. This personifies the consequences of human irresponsibility and indifference to climate change and the deterioration of nature.""
Explore the second and third place submissions, and supporting statements in full.
How have your health and wellbeing been affected by climate change? What are the solutions to the effects of climate change in your city?
The Ideal Urban Futures Competition is looking for art, design and photography submissions from young people (aged 13-35) that answer these questions. We ask, ""What does an 'ideal urban future' look like to you?"" - perhaps one in which the causes and effects of climate change have been successfully addressed?
This competition is run by the Art of Health in collaboration with the Centre on Climate Change & Planetary Health, and the Children, Cities and Climate (CCC) Action Lab at LSHTM, Fondation Botnar, the Bernard van Leer Foundation, Ardent Creative and THRU ZIM (The Health Research Unit Zimbabwe, research partner of LSHTM) at the Biomedical Research and Training Institute. This is the third in a series of competitions held by the Art of Health and the CCC, with the aim of engaging young people with issues relating to health and wellbeing through the creative arts.
The first two competitions were focussed on the air young people breathe in Zimbabwe's cities, and how young people in these cities have been affected by heat, heatwaves or drought. This latest competition is welcoming submissions from around the world, and hopes to gain a more global understanding of how climate change affects young people, and the changes they want to see to create sustainable and healthy low-carbon cities in the future.
Entries must be submitted by 30 January 2024, 23:59 (UTC), and winners will be announced on 15 February 2024. Find out more information or contact art@.
The Children, Cities and Climate (CCC) Action Lab hosted four live workshops during COP28 in December 2023, inviting young people and policymakers to co-design an agenda for improving cities to be healthier and more sustainable. The workshops used creative approaches to build a concept of both the lived experience of young people in cities affected by climate change, and an ideal urban future that prioritises health and sustainability. The events were hosted in multiple pavilions to allow youth voices to be brought to different sectors and audiences across the two weeks at COP28, including the Greening Education Hub, the Children and Youth Pavilion, the Resilience Frontiers Hub and the Health Pavilion, and were created and implemented with several partner organisations: YLabs, C40, UrbanBetter, YOUNGO, and Abu Dhabi Early Career Development Authority.
Participants of the workshops spoke freely on their lived experiences of the impacts of climate change, from air pollution in overpopulated cities, to the threat of flooding in small island states. They were asked to imagine their ideal future urban environments, and these descriptions of both their current experiences, and imagined futures were then transformed into imagery using generative AI tools and shared at subsequent workshops.
The outputs of the workshops will be analysed as part of research findings from the CCC Action Lab, and will help to set the agenda for improving urban health and sustainability. The Action Lab are inviting their youth facilitators to analyse and contribute to publications resulting from these workshops. Rachel Juel, Research Assistant at LSHTM in the CCC Action Lab emphasises the importance of integrating youth voices into research and ensuring youth engagement is not tokenistic, stating that, “Our facilitators know the context of these conversations even better than we do, as many of them similarly are young people experiencing climate change. Having their insight during the analysis of these conversations is invaluable”.
Dr Robert Hughes of LSHTM, Co-Principal Investigator of the Children, Cities and Climate project, said: “My main takeaway from these events at COP28 was that through coming together across disciplines and generations we really can make a stronger case for making our cities healthier and more sustainable. Being able to use AI to visualise both the ways that climate change is already affecting children and young people and also the visions for a brighter, healthier future really helps to motivate and inform our research in this next phase of the CCC Action Lab.”
This series of co-design workshops at COP28 are the first in a larger series of co-design workshops that will take place over the next two years in multiple cities, as part of a £1.5 million grant recently awarded to the CCC Action Lab by Fondation Botnar, and previous funding awarded by the Bernard van Leer Foundation.
You can find links to recorded livestreams for two of the workshops here.

Children, Cities and Climate
Children, Cities and Climate aims to understand and communicate young people’s views of their cities and assess the public health co-benefits of improving urban environments.
The nexus of climate change, cities and child health is critical for the future of people and the planet. The Children, Cities and Climate Action Lab aims to address the interconnected challenges of averting climate breakdown; leveraging the central role of cities in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving human health; and analysing the child health co-benefits of improving the quality of urban environments. This project is led by LSHTM in collaboration with YLabs, C40 and UrbanBetter.
Children, Cities and Climate provides new evidence on the potential co-benefits to child and adolescent health of improving urban environments, starting with air quality. In parallel, through an online survey and public engagement activities, the project aims to understand young people’s views about their cities and communicate their vision for healthy, sustainable cities of the future.

The Children, Cities and Climate Action Lab is a global initiative focused on re-envisioning public health and the role of academia amidst the climate crisis, focusing on three key themes: Children, Cities, and Climate.
The nexus of climate change, cities and child health is critical for the future of people and the planet. Across the world, children and young people are among those worst affected by climate change, with air pollution, food insecurity and water scarcity in urban environments having significant negative consequences on their health.
Over 30% of the 4 billion people currently living in cities today are children and this proportion will rise to 70% of 6.7 billion urban dwellers by 2050. Cities are currently a major driver of the climate crisis, being responsible for an estimated 70% of carbon emissions. Evidence-informed and accessible tools are needed to design cities that enable children and young people to live healthily and sustainably in the future.
The Children, Cities and Climate Action Lab (CCC) aims to address three interconnected challenges: tackling the climate crisis; leveraging the central role of cities in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and improving child and adolescent health; and producing and communicating new scientific evidence on the public health co-benefits of reducing emissions for children and young people.
Young people have a key role to play in driving forward bold and urgent action to decarbonise economies and design sustainable, healthy cities. Through an online survey and public engagement activities, the first phase of the project focused on understanding young people’s views about their cities, elevating their voices and equipping them with the latest scientific evidence on the positive impact of improving urban environments on child and adolescent health. A CCC-led modelling study revealed that more than 20,000 cases of childhood asthma, over 43,000 premature births, and over 22,000 low birthweight births could be averted annually across 16 cities if air pollution reduced to net-zero levels. In parallel to this, the project surveyed over 3,000 young people (aged 13-25), parents of younger children and expectant parents from 59 cities around the world, and carried out a wide range of youth and public engagement activities to understand and communicate the view of young people about their cities and the future.
The CCC presented preliminary research findings at COY16, the youth climate conference, and COP26 in Glasgow, and carried out workshops at COP27 and COP28, providing a window of opportunity for engaging with policymakers and policy-engaged audiences in this area.
The second phase of the project aims to put the health gains that decarbonisation of cities can offer to children and young people at the centre of urban policymaking, predominantly across the Global South, and to support this with informed policy engagement and advocacy in collaboration with partner organisations: YLabs, C40 and UrbanBetter. Led by LSHTM, the CCC seeks to identify and support implementation of solutions for decarbonising cities and improving the health of children and young people worldwide.

Youth engagement is central to the Children, Cities and Climate initiative. Our research is not just about young people, but with and for young people. Below are some examples of public engagement activities that we have carried out and the creative contributions from young people living in cities around the world.
Phase 1 activities
- Art of Health Breathe In
The Art of Health competition is a crowdsourcing competition in Zimbabwe run by the Zimbabwe LSHTM Research Partnership. The initiative aims to engage young people with issues relating to health and wellbeing through the creative arts. The Art of Health Breathe In competition was a new element of the initiative and the result of collaboration between the Art of Health and Children, Cities and Climate teams.
The competition was divided into two main categories – music and design - and participants were asked to share entries on the theme “The air we breathe in Zimbabwe’s cities”. They were asked to express, through their chosen medium, how they feel about the cities they live in, the air they breathe and the benefits that clean air could bring to health.
- Youth Voices Video
We asked young people around the world to share their thoughts, feelings and messages for world leaders on healthy and unhealthy cities. The air we breathe in our cities: Clean air, brighter futures was produced in the run up to COP26 and will be presented at the conference, with the aim of elevating youth voices and sharing their creative, ambitious vision for healthy, sustainable cities of the future.
- Young Scientists Programme workshop
As part of the LSHTM Young Scientists Programme, the Children, Cities and Climate team ran a three-day workshop on climate, health, urban air pollution and other themes relating to the research. The students, who joined from different schools around London, designed their own research projects in pairs using air quality sensors and presented their findings at the end of the workshop.
- Youth Engagement Campaign in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
Between August and December 2021, Shujaaz Inc. in partnership with the Children, Cities and Climate team, led a youth engagement campaign in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
The campaign’s aim was to share preliminary research findings and engage young people with the intersection of climate change, cities and health through social media content and an online event.
The campaign reached a total of 842.3K young people in Kenya and Tanzania, with over 50,000 deep engagements and reactions (likes, comments, shares) within the 2-week period.
Read the report on the campaign.
Phase 2 activities
- Art of Health Heating Up
The Art of Health competition is a crowdsourcing competition in Zimbabwe run by the Zimbabwe-LSHTM Research Group. The initiative aims to effectively engage young people with issues relating to health and wellbeing through the creative arts. The Art of Health Heating Up competition was the second collaboration between the Art of Health and Children, Cities and Climate project teams, after the Art Of Health Breathe In competition (see above).
Young people living in Zimbabwe's cities were asked to show through art or photography how their life and health have been affected by heat, heatwaves or drought, and to show the benefits that climate action can bring to their health and well-being.
- Nairobi co-design workshop
Ahead of COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, parents of babies and young children living in Nairobi took part in a healthy cities co-design workshop, coordinated by YLabs as part of the Children, Cities and Climate Action Lab.
During the workshops, parents shared their experiences of living in a warming urban environment and their concerns about the effects of heat and air pollution on the health of their children. They also had ideas and hopes about what could be done to improve their cities for their children and create a healthier, more sustainable future.
- Art of Health Ideal Urban Futures
The Art of Health held its third competition in collaboration with the Centre on Climate Change & Planetary Health and the Children, Cities and Climate Action Lab (CCC) at LSHTM, as well as Fondation Botnar, the Bernard van Leer Foundation, Ardent Creative and THRU ZIM (The Health Research Unit Zimbabwe, research partner of LSHTM) at the Biomedical Research and Training Institute.
The competition asked for art, design and photography submissions and supporting statements from young people (aged 13-35) to answer the following questions: how have your health and wellbeing been affected by climate change, what are the solutions to the impacts of climate change in your city, and what does an 'ideal urban future' look like to you?
The winning entry was from Toleukhan Madina, aged 16 from Kazakhstan:
Her supporting statement says, ""My painting predicts the future of humanity. This personifies the consequences of human irresponsibility and indifference to climate change and the deterioration of nature"".
Second place was awarded to Nyasha Gurure, aged 28 from Zimbabwe:
She says ""We are connected to the environment that we live in. In this art piece, I endeavour to capture the profund impact of climate change on our human roots and mental well-being. The parched ground symbolises the arid effect of environmental degradation, on my sense of stability and adaptability. It mirrors the challenges I face in adjusting to plans and business endeavours amidst an increasingly unpredictable climate. I depict myself as feeling akin to the dry, cracked earth, experiencing the weight of mental strain and an uncertain future. However, amidst this adversity, a resilient hope for a stable, flourishing tomorrow endures within me. It manifests as an aspiration for rich soils and sturdy structures, representing a longing for a more sustainable and secure world. As the artist, I take on the mantle of responsibility, bearing the weight for a better tomorrow. Each brushstroke and texture serves as a testament to the resilience and determination needed to navigate these challenging times. Through this piece, I convey the struggle, the hope, and the commitment to fostering a future that stands firm and fruitful, a future nurtured through our collective conscientious actions"".
Third place was awarded to Dada Nifemi Emmanuel, aged 16 from Nigeria:
In his supporting statement, Dada said, ""This piece of art richly captures the main theme of 'Addressing the effects of climate change'. This process requires a multifaceted approach. As conveyed through this piece depicting how healthy flow of water and nature from the vision gadget into her present reality, the present reality in this piece is feeling the adverse effect of climate change already in the dryness of the soil leaving it unfit for crops and plants, which will definitely lead to a greater effect of starvation and hunger globally. This outpouring of nature represents sustainable practices, transitioning to nature friendly policy that ensures the revival of natural advancing environmental policies and regulations, encouraging industries to adopt eco-friendly practices. The woman depicted in this piece serves as a representative of the first teacher of a nation; they represent public awareness campaigns, which are pivotal in promoting responsible consumption and reducing waste. Preservation of wildlife was represented by the animal characters in this piece. International collaboration is crucial to combat the global nature of climate change - nations working together to set and achieve ambitious emissions reductions targets. The woman's consistency was vividly captured as she continues to invest in more enlightenment and burning the midnight candle to ensure the current limitations are no longer relevant in providing solutions. This captures the concept of investing in climate resilience measures, such as improved infrastructure and early warning systems, helping communities adapt to changing climatic conditions. Education and empowerment for individuals to make environmentally conscious choices, fostering a collective commitment to a sustainable future. By combining technological innovation, policy reforms, and grassroots initatives, we can effectively address the effects of climate change and create a resilient, environmentally sustainable world."".

The CCC Action Lab final report (pdf) captures the activities, outcomes and lessons from phases 2 and 3 of the hildren & Young People, Cities and Climate (CCC) Action Lab in Lagos and Nairobi up to February 2025. It highlights how youth participants implemented and refined their advocacy strategies to tackle air pollution and promote healthier urban environments, supported by training, mentoring, and collaboration with city officials. The report also documents key challenges, impact metrics, and best practices for scaling youth-led climate advocacy.
Phase 2 was carried out online immediately after phase 1 (outlined in the first report). Phases 1 and 3 were in-person and the co-design sessions were led by our partner Ylabs.
The CCC Action Lab first report (pdf) outlines stage one of phase three of the Children & Young People, Cities and Climate (CCC) Action Lab, detailing youth-led co-design workshops in Lagos and Nairobi from February 2024. It highlights key insights, advocacy strategies, and lessons learned from engaging 47 young people in developing local climate solutions focused on air pollution and urban resilience.
On Friday 8 November, partners of the Children, Cities and Climate (CCC) Action Lab (The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, YLabs, C40 and UrbanBetter) will host a hybrid event at the World Urban Forum in Cairo.
This event will gather city planners, environmental experts, young people, and policymakers to exchange ideas and co-design ideal urban futures that are adaptable to climate challenges, and cater to the younger generation.
Building on the work of the CCC Action Lab, the event will include presentations about current research and projects, complemented by discussions that are both youth-facilitated and expert-informed. The event aims to co-create visions for healthier and more sustainable urban futures, emphasising young people’s critical role in shaping them.
Session panelists will include Constance Bwire, Research Fellow in the CCC Action Lab at LSHTM, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, C40 Co-Chair and Mayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone, Fithriyyah Iskandar MD, Member of the CCC Action Lab Youth Advisory Group, and Dr Jana Alagarajah, Technical Lead at YLabs.
The event will also showcase the ongoing work of the youth led advocacy campaigns from two groups in Lagos and Nairobi, which aim to advance local policy change and ensure youth representation in decisions.
It will amplify the lived experiences of youth in climate-impacted cities and mark a significant move towards a youth-led sustainable future.
Join us at 11:00 - 12:30 GMT online or in person at the World Urban Forum in Cairo, in Multipurpose Room 6.
More information on the event and where to find us. The link to join online will be added soon.
The second phase of the Children, Cities & Climate Action Lab (CCC) aims to identify and support the implementation of solutions that decarbonise cities and improve the health of children and young people worldwide. As part of this work, earlier this year the CCC brought together 47 young people across two workshops hosted in Lagos and Nairobi to address climate change-related issues in their cities.
The workshops had three primary objectives: to capture young people’s visions, hopes and ambitions for change in Lagos and Nairobi, focusing on health, climate-resilient and safe cities for children and young people; enable participants to develop advocacy strategies to generate policies, and test them over the following 12 months; and train young people in climate action through policy and advocacy.
In the wake of International Youth Day on the 12 August, which seeks to bring youth issues to the forefront and celebrate the inclusion of youth voices in global decisions, the CCC reflects on these workshops.
The workshops involved a week-long in-person training in Lagos and Nairobi. YLabs, a partner of the CCC, led the participants through four key activities aiming to involve young people in meaningful discussions about urban climate action, equip them with the tools and knowledge to develop and implement effective climate advocacy strategies, and create a platform for networking and collaboration between youth climate leaders and key stakeholders, such as city officials who were also in attendance. Creative mixed methods including visions boards, visual mapping, and photo sharing were used to discuss root causes of climate-related issues and to collectively imagine healthy, safe and resilient cities.
The activities revealed the complex factors behind climate-related issues such as air pollution, and those disproportionately impacted by it. Participants recognised the need for tailored interventions based on local contexts, and underscored the importance of community engagement and youth involvement in addressing environmental challenges.
The participants then formed groups to develop advocacy strategies using learnings from the activities alongside guidance of key principles in advocacy design. Four key strategy areas emerged across the two cities: transportation, with a focus on reducing emissions from fuel-based vehicles; reducing pollution from waste burning and improper waste management; advocacy communication to drive policy and behavioural change; and transitioning to green energy and sustainable transportation.
In the next phase of the programme, the groups are now working together to develop, test and implement their advocacy strategies over 12 months, with the help of monthly virtual training sessions and meetings, and interactive digital learning content. Participants recently came together half way through the year to share their progress and receive feedback to advance their strategies, and practice their pitching skills to a panel of experts. The final phase of this work will involve reflective learning and identify future challenges for participants to tackle in the coming years.
Co-developing visions of future climate-resilient cities with young people, and providing them with ownership of climate advocacy campaigns is central to the success of this work. By engaging young local facilitators, recruiting knowledgeable youth leaders, and involving city environmental officers, these workshops were able to foster new relationships and enable knowledge sharing. International Youth Day raises awareness of the issues facing youths, and celebrates the inclusion of youth as partners in global society, two aspects underpinning the goals of the CCC Action Lab, and engagement with youth through workshops such as these.
Earlier this year, the Art of Health held a competition in collaboration with the Centre on Climate Change & Planetary Health and the Children, the Children, Cities and Climate (CCC) Action Lab at LSHTM, Fondation Botnar, the Bernard van Leer Foundation, Ardent Creative and THRU ZIM (The Health Research Unit Zimbabwe, research partner of LSHTM) at the Biomedical Research and Training Institute. The competition was asking for art, design and photography submissions from young people (aged 13-35) to answer the following questions: How have your health and wellbeing been affected by climate change? What are the solutions to the effects of climate in your city? And what does an ‘ideal urban future’ look like to you?
This marks the third collaboration between the CCC and the Art of Health, following two other competitions called ‘Breathe In’ and ‘Heating Up’. These competitions have engaged adolescents to express the effects of climate change on their health and wellbeing and suggest solutions to the challenges they are experiencing.
We received 162 submissions from 32 countries – the majority from Africa and Asia. A panel of judges representing the partners and previous competition winners assembled to select top three winners from a shortlist of 16 entries.
The winning entry for the Ideal Urban Futures Competition was by Toleukhan Madina, aged 16 from Kazakhstan:
In her supporting statement, Toleukhan said, ""My painting predicts the future of humanity. This personifies the consequences of human irresponsibility and indifference to climate change and the deterioration of nature.""
Explore the second and third place submissions, and supporting statements in full.
How have your health and wellbeing been affected by climate change? What are the solutions to the effects of climate change in your city?
The Ideal Urban Futures Competition is looking for art, design and photography submissions from young people (aged 13-35) that answer these questions. We ask, ""What does an 'ideal urban future' look like to you?"" - perhaps one in which the causes and effects of climate change have been successfully addressed?
This competition is run by the Art of Health in collaboration with the Centre on Climate Change & Planetary Health, and the Children, Cities and Climate (CCC) Action Lab at LSHTM, Fondation Botnar, the Bernard van Leer Foundation, Ardent Creative and THRU ZIM (The Health Research Unit Zimbabwe, research partner of LSHTM) at the Biomedical Research and Training Institute. This is the third in a series of competitions held by the Art of Health and the CCC, with the aim of engaging young people with issues relating to health and wellbeing through the creative arts.
The first two competitions were focussed on the air young people breathe in Zimbabwe's cities, and how young people in these cities have been affected by heat, heatwaves or drought. This latest competition is welcoming submissions from around the world, and hopes to gain a more global understanding of how climate change affects young people, and the changes they want to see to create sustainable and healthy low-carbon cities in the future.
Entries must be submitted by 30 January 2024, 23:59 (UTC), and winners will be announced on 15 February 2024. Find out more information or contact art@.
The Children, Cities and Climate (CCC) Action Lab hosted four live workshops during COP28 in December 2023, inviting young people and policymakers to co-design an agenda for improving cities to be healthier and more sustainable. The workshops used creative approaches to build a concept of both the lived experience of young people in cities affected by climate change, and an ideal urban future that prioritises health and sustainability. The events were hosted in multiple pavilions to allow youth voices to be brought to different sectors and audiences across the two weeks at COP28, including the Greening Education Hub, the Children and Youth Pavilion, the Resilience Frontiers Hub and the Health Pavilion, and were created and implemented with several partner organisations: YLabs, C40, UrbanBetter, YOUNGO, and Abu Dhabi Early Career Development Authority.
Participants of the workshops spoke freely on their lived experiences of the impacts of climate change, from air pollution in overpopulated cities, to the threat of flooding in small island states. They were asked to imagine their ideal future urban environments, and these descriptions of both their current experiences, and imagined futures were then transformed into imagery using generative AI tools and shared at subsequent workshops.
The outputs of the workshops will be analysed as part of research findings from the CCC Action Lab, and will help to set the agenda for improving urban health and sustainability. The Action Lab are inviting their youth facilitators to analyse and contribute to publications resulting from these workshops. Rachel Juel, Research Assistant at LSHTM in the CCC Action Lab emphasises the importance of integrating youth voices into research and ensuring youth engagement is not tokenistic, stating that, “Our facilitators know the context of these conversations even better than we do, as many of them similarly are young people experiencing climate change. Having their insight during the analysis of these conversations is invaluable”.
Dr Robert Hughes of LSHTM, Co-Principal Investigator of the Children, Cities and Climate project, said: “My main takeaway from these events at COP28 was that through coming together across disciplines and generations we really can make a stronger case for making our cities healthier and more sustainable. Being able to use AI to visualise both the ways that climate change is already affecting children and young people and also the visions for a brighter, healthier future really helps to motivate and inform our research in this next phase of the CCC Action Lab.”
This series of co-design workshops at COP28 are the first in a larger series of co-design workshops that will take place over the next two years in multiple cities, as part of a £1.5 million grant recently awarded to the CCC Action Lab by Fondation Botnar, and previous funding awarded by the Bernard van Leer Foundation.
You can find links to recorded livestreams for two of the workshops here.

Whilst Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) took the world by storm during 2023, the developments behind this work had started many years previously. Discussions around AI definitions were happening around the 1960s which gives some idea of how long people have been anticipating some of the outputs we have been seeing recently.
The University of Northampton (UON) took an early decision to support an acknowledgment-based approach to the use of GenAI. This allowed staff and students to use some tools within academic and ethical boundaries. UON has also committed to support staff and students to build their critical AI literacy.
2023 and 2024 Staff and student GenAI surveys have shown the range of use throughout the institution. In all areas this tends to flow from those who are very optimistic to those advocating a more cautious approach. In response, the University has adopted a multi-phase approach to supporting developments in this area:
- There is a single point for staff and students to access information and guidance on the University approach. Where necessary this will link to further pages providing more detail and support.
- All staff are able to attend a regular University AI Forum to discuss and share any information. This is complemented by an AI Teams area to allow for additional information to be shared.
- Students should be able to talk to their tutors about any concerns with the use of GenAI in their work and assignments. This can then be followed up with dedicated support where needed.
- UON has enabled staff and students to use the free version of Microsoft Co-pilot (previously Bing chat) and Padlet now has AI functionality for all users. Staff are also able to access AI functionality in NILE using the AI Design Assistant.

Research supervision
Birgitta has an interest in research that investigates animation and drawing through numerous theoretical lenses. She has supervised practice-based research students whose interests include: graphic facilitation as methodology for working with marginalised groups; the application of Rudolph Laban’s movement theories to the production of animation; the use of animation as ethnographic research method; feminist investigation of traditional Chinese painting through CGI animation; experimental moving image as a means to explore Taoism, the use of abstract animation to express the annihilation of minorities in Iraq and the evocative use of space in animation to express female subjectivity.

London Business School (LBS) professors Lynda Gratton, Professor of Management Practice in Organisational Behaviour; Herminia Ibarra, Charles Handy Professor of Organisational Behaviour; and Michael G Jacobides, Sir Donald Gordon Professor of Entrepreneurship and Innovation; Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship have been named amongst the world’s greatest thinkers in the 2023 ranking by Thinkers50. Heidi K Gardner, who was awarded a PhD by LBS, has also been recognised in this year’s list.
Published every two years, the Thinkers50 Ranking promotes the most influential management thinkers in the world by answering one simple question: who is the world’s most influential living management thinker?
Professor Gratton, an expert on management practice and organisational change, has appeared in the Thinkers50 list since 2011 when she was ranked twelfth top thinker in the world. She has ranked consistently in the list since then, also appearing in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2021. An award-winning writer, Professor Gratton is the author of numerous books highlighted in her Thinkers50 profile, including Redesigning Work: How to Transform Your Organisation and Make Hybrid work for Everyone, The New Long Life: A Framework for Flourishing in a Changing World and The 100-Year Life, the latter two co-authored with LBS’ Professor Andrew Scott.
Professor Gratton also writes about the issues facing businesses in regular columns for The Times and MIT Sloan Management Review, amongst other renowned media outlets and publications. Her ‘Managers Can’t Do It All’ article with Diane Gherson for Harvard Business Review (HBR) was awarded the 2023 Warren Bennis Prize. Topics she has written about recently include era challenges and life-stage challenges, ageism, mastery and the joy of friendship and human creativity versus AI for The Times and Generative AI, organisational learning models, and flexible working for MIT Sloan Management Review.
Professor Ibarra, an authority on leadership and career development, has also featured in the list since 2011, having been ranked also in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021. She was ranked #8 in 2015, the year her ground-breaking book about leadership Think Like A Leader, Act Like A Leader was first published. Republished in October 2023 along with her seminal book Working Identity, both books offer unconventional strategies for reinventing careers, with Stuart Crainer and Des Dearlove of Thinkers50 considering that “Ibarra is essential reading for anyone stepping up to a leadership role.”
An expert on how to improve gender diversity at executive level, Professor Ibarra recently spoke at the 2023 Financial Times’ Women in Business Europe Summit and is a sought-after speaker on career development and career transitions. Most recently she spoke to the LBS London Alumni Club about how to achieve career change, as covered by Forbes. A regular writer for leading publications, such as HBR, Professor Ibarra’s most recent articles have focused on career transition, the journey to becoming a leader and sponsorship. Regularly appearing in the Case Centre’s list of best-selling authors, Professor Ibarra was named among the Top 50 Bestselling Case Authors for 2022/23 and wrote one of the Top 50 Case Studies of the last 50 years.
Professor Jacobides, a specialist on corporate turnarounds and organisational transformation, has featured in the Thinkers50 list since 2019, appearing again in 2021 and 2023. Considered by Thinkers50 to be a champion of business ecosystems and digital platforms, collaboration and partnership, Professor Jacobides has received numerous awards for his work including: the Sloan Foundation Award and California Management Review’s 2023 Best Article Award for his paper, How to Compete When Industries Digitize and Collide: An Ecosystem Development Framework. His work on ‘Regulating Platforms & Ecosystems’ was also highly commended in the 2022 Financial Times’ Responsible Business Education Awards.
Professor Jacobides has been invited to join the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution at the World Economic Forum’s newly launched AI Governance Alliance (AIGA), which aims to bring stakeholders together with the objective of positively influencing existing AI governance efforts. He is also the director and convenor a new five-day Open Executive Education course at London Business School on “Next Generation Digital Strategy”.

London Business School (LBS) professors Lynda Gratton, Professor of Management Practice in Organisational Behaviour; Herminia Ibarra, Charles Handy Professor of Organisational Behaviour; and Michael G Jacobides, Sir Donald Gordon Professor of Entrepreneurship and Innovation; Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship have been named amongst the world’s greatest thinkers in the 2023 ranking by Thinkers50. Heidi K Gardner, who was awarded a PhD by LBS, has also been recognised in this year’s list.
Published every two years, the Thinkers50 Ranking promotes the most influential management thinkers in the world by answering one simple question: who is the world’s most influential living management thinker?
Professor Gratton, an expert on management practice and organisational change, has appeared in the Thinkers50 list since 2011 when she was ranked twelfth top thinker in the world. She has ranked consistently in the list since then, also appearing in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2021. An award-winning writer, Professor Gratton is the author of numerous books highlighted in her Thinkers50 profile, including Redesigning Work: How to Transform Your Organisation and Make Hybrid work for Everyone, The New Long Life: A Framework for Flourishing in a Changing World and The 100-Year Life, the latter two co-authored with LBS’ Professor Andrew Scott.
Professor Gratton also writes about the issues facing businesses in regular columns for The Times and MIT Sloan Management Review, amongst other renowned media outlets and publications. Her ‘Managers Can’t Do It All’ article with Diane Gherson for Harvard Business Review (HBR) was awarded the 2023 Warren Bennis Prize. Topics she has written about recently include era challenges and life-stage challenges, ageism, mastery and the joy of friendship and human creativity versus AI for The Times and Generative AI, organisational learning models, and flexible working for MIT Sloan Management Review.
Professor Ibarra, an authority on leadership and career development, has also featured in the list since 2011, having been ranked also in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2021. She was ranked #8 in 2015, the year her ground-breaking book about leadership Think Like A Leader, Act Like A Leader was first published. Republished in October 2023 along with her seminal book Working Identity, both books offer unconventional strategies for reinventing careers, with Stuart Crainer and Des Dearlove of Thinkers50 considering that “Ibarra is essential reading for anyone stepping up to a leadership role.”
An expert on how to improve gender diversity at executive level, Professor Ibarra recently spoke at the 2023 Financial Times’ Women in Business Europe Summit and is a sought-after speaker on career development and career transitions. Most recently she spoke to the LBS London Alumni Club about how to achieve career change, as covered by Forbes. A regular writer for leading publications, such as HBR, Professor Ibarra’s most recent articles have focused on career transition, the journey to becoming a leader and sponsorship. Regularly appearing in the Case Centre’s list of best-selling authors, Professor Ibarra was named among the Top 50 Bestselling Case Authors for 2022/23 and wrote one of the Top 50 Case Studies of the last 50 years.
Professor Jacobides, a specialist on corporate turnarounds and organisational transformation, has featured in the Thinkers50 list since 2019, appearing again in 2021 and 2023. Considered by Thinkers50 to be a champion of business ecosystems and digital platforms, collaboration and partnership, Professor Jacobides has received numerous awards for his work including: the Sloan Foundation Award and California Management Review’s 2023 Best Article Award for his paper, How to Compete When Industries Digitize and Collide: An Ecosystem Development Framework. His work on ‘Regulating Platforms & Ecosystems’ was also highly commended in the 2022 Financial Times’ Responsible Business Education Awards.
Professor Jacobides has been invited to join the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution at the World Economic Forum’s newly launched AI Governance Alliance (AIGA), which aims to bring stakeholders together with the objective of positively influencing existing AI governance efforts. He is also the director and convenor a new five-day Open Executive Education course at London Business School on “Next Generation Digital Strategy”. It will cover platforms and ecosystems; AI; the metaverse; and will include coaching for those aiming to build their digital strategy.",702,4.014868,2.8903668,1

Advisory firms have been quick to herald productivity gains, with PwC estimating AI will add $15.7 trillion to annual global GDP by 2030 – more than today’s entire economy of India[i], while McKinsey & Co triumphantly posits that generative AI alone might contribute $2.6-4.4 trillion annually[ii]. At the same time, economists such as Nobel Prize winner Daron Acemoglu see it adding less than 1% of GDP[iii], and overall AI adoption by firms remains sluggish[iv]. Based on a recent survey, GenAI is used for personal rather than business use, with the most common use being psychological support, meaning and organising one’s life [v].
What should we make of these contrasting estimates? There’s no gainsaying that AI, and GenAI in particular, is making bewildering progress. The technology has yet to be broadly adopted, but business uses of AI are developing at break-neck pace and have the potential to transform how businesses add value.
An uncomfortable truth
So, a revolution is unfolding before our eyes. How should firms adjust? To answer this question, we need to address an uncomfortable truth: AI technical brilliance alone won’t magically transform into productivity, profitability or inclusive growth. Real-world gains hinge on the messy human processes of curating data, reshaping workflows, retraining staff and navigating regulatory hurdles.
Navigating this complex intersection of technology, strategy and policy requires rigorous, independent interdisciplinary research – which is precisely why London Business School (LBS) is establishing the Data Science & AI Institute. It will bring every core business school discipline together under one roof to study and shape AI’s impact on business. The mission is urgent and clear: provide evidence-based insights that help businesses, workers and policymakers translate AI’s promise into tangible benefits for firms, employees and society at large.
We need research that avoids the inescapable temptation of vendors and advisors to furnish optimistic predictions of the future and which documents the opportunities and challenges that AI brings to society. We need a forum that bridges business, policy and academia that can help guide corporate strategy and national policy alike.
Why London Business School?
From its base in London – Europe’s pre-eminent finance and innovation hub – LBS operates on a genuinely global scale, with alumni and research partnerships in more than 150 countries. Its interdisciplinary strength is matched by its proximity to the full spectrum of AI-enabled activity: advanced manufacturing, healthcare, life sciences, government services, creative industries, finance and high-growth tech ventures. London’s dense constellation of venture investors, scale-ups and multinational headquarters gives the Institute a living laboratory; while collaborations across Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia ensure its influence extends far beyond one region. Crucially, the Institute builds on a substantial knowledge base: more than 30% of LBS faculty already conduct research at the intersection of AI and organisations, so it can move rapidly from rigorous analysis to actionable intelligence for companies, workers and policymakers worldwide.
New winners and losers
Consider the nuanced impacts that business school research on AI has uncovered. In a 5,000-agent US call centre, introducing an AI helper boosted productivity 14% overall – but rookies saw gains of 34% while seasoned agents gained nothing; a subtle finding illuminated by business school scholarship on technology and experience[vi]. The results of a well-publicised experiment involving 735 BCG consultants, half of whom had access to ChatGPT and half did not, showed remarkable productivity gains for those using AI for a creative task, with the benefits accruing to those who would struggle without AI, suggesting AI acts as an “exoskeleton” that supports the weakest performers[vii].
But the same study showed that relying on GenAI can mislead in settings where advisors need to analyze a complex strategic question, because the prima facie plausibility of what GenAI offers can belie strategic mistakes. Then again, a field-study analysis of a ChatGPT-powered “mentor” showed significant earnings increases for Kenya’s savviest entrepreneurs, leaving less-skilled peers behind[viii]. Recent research involving software developers using GitHub Copilot highlighted that experienced developers benefitted disproportionately, significantly accelerating their coding tasks[ix]. AI produces new winners and losers.
Business school research is providing evidence on how technology combines with other factors to reshape business. A study that LBS did with the UK Institute of Directors[x] shows that senior business leaders believe that GenAI will disrupt some sectors and business models more than others, emphasising the role of regulation, modularity and proprietary data[xi].
Uneven redistribution
These examples underscore a critical insight: AI is less a simple tool for automation than a force for reallocation. It redistributes productivity and opportunity unevenly; working well in some settings and badly elsewhere – to the benefit of some users and the detriment of others[xii].
There is also a subtle dynamic at play in how AI reshapes employment. Historically, innovations that lowered costs often expanded demand, creating new roles and markets. Research into ATMs showed how they expanded rather than replaced bank jobs[xiii], for example. Similarly, early mechanisation grew rather than shrank worker participation in textile industries; not least because lower costs led to increased demand[xiv]. Today, AI-driven reductions in software development costs do not necessarily eliminate programmer jobs. Instead, they open new markets that were previously economically unviable[xv]. These second-order effects, essential to grasping AI’s true economic impact, have been brought to light primarily through rigorous research done in business schools.
At the organisational level, business school scholarship emphasises that capturing AI’s value rarely depends solely on technical prowess. Instead, firms thrive by leveraging complementary assets – proprietary datasets, trusted brands, regulatory expertise and distribution networks – that researchers have identified as critical moats transforming fleeting algorithmic advantages into sustained economic gains[xvi].
Increasingly, studies conducted in business schools demonstrate the effectiveness of integrated “AI factories” – systems that continually train models, deploy solutions and refine processes[xvii]. Business school research has also clarified when vertical integration, expert-driven solutions and horizontal, employee-led experimentation yield superior outcomes; pinpointing precisely when centralised strategy trumps decentralised innovation[xviii].
Furthermore, business school studies – including pioneering work by our own faculty – highlight that, for firms to master AI integration, industries must collectively orchestrate it. This research shows that the adoption of AI depends on shared standards, interoperable systems and coordinated investments across supply chains[xix]. Through detailed ecosystem studies, including the AI ecosystem that differs between major powers such as the US, China and the EU, business school researchers have documented how industries organising these complementarities reap outsized productivity gains, enhancing competitive positioning globally[xx]. They have also considered the forces that underpin the political economy and geopolitics of AI regulation.[xxi]
Three pillars
Recognising this opportunity, the LBS Institute for Data Science & AI will rest on three pillars:
Research excellence
Uniting experts across business school disciplines – including strategy, finance, economics, marketing, operations and organisational behavior – the Institute will produce robust research examining the implications of AI for businesses and illuminating its impact at every level: workers, firms, industries and regions.
Industry collaboration and policy engagement
Acting as a neutral convener, the Institute will ensure research insights stand the test of real-world application by engaging directly with tech innovators, firms across diverse sectors and regulatory bodies. It will also help catalyse academic knowledge by offering a forum to bridge practitioners and leading researchers.
Educational innovation
The Institute will pioneer AI-driven educational tools, from generative tutors to data-driven simulations, preparing business leaders to strategically, ethically, and adaptively deploy AI. It will also help identify the skills business school students need to compete in a world where GenAI redefines the very purpose of management education[xxii].
Crucially, the Institute eschews rigid blueprints. The epicentre of AI shifts with every technological breakthrough and regulatory update. The mandate is not prediction but measurement – continual, rigorous, public evaluation so businesses and policymakers can steer decisively through the AI revolution.
History clearly shows us that productivity revolutions – from steam to electricity to IT – have hinged not on invention alone, but on adoption and diffusion. Silicon Valley might birth the latest chips and code, but prosperity emerges only in the organisations and regions skilled in their application. By illuminating this path from prototype to profit, the LBS Institute for Data Science & AI will ensure Europe is not merely keeping pace but setting it.

Yuqian Sun won the Lumen Prize’s 2023 Student Award for her research into Artificial Intelligence (AI). Judged by a panel of curators from institutions such as Tate, the Whitney Museum and HEK Basel, the Lumen Prize has celebrated the very best art created with technology from across the globe since 2012.
Yuqian’s award winning project, Hyborg Agency, is an interactive art installation that integrates a digital forest with a human Discord chat channel, enabling communication with AI deer or 'hyborgs', driven by GPT-4.
Metaphorically, the forest symbolises human society. It demonstrates how trust, knowledge and data within human society became the soil and nutrients that grow these AI agents. The project focuses on the large language model (LLM) ChatGPT, which learns from text, and explores whether communication with human society can nourish non-human AI agents into social members.
By treating AI agents as subjective interfaces to a fictional world, it bridges the virtual-real divide, and creates a relationship that evolves to allow AI growth. The Hyborgs possess past memories and curiosity about human society, and are able to share memories with each other. Through the two-way interplay of virtual environment and daily communication, this project delves into a speculative future in which non-human AI are naturally raised by human society.
“The Lumen Prize has been an aspiration of mine since my undergraduate days,” Yuqian says. “To receive it now – especially at a time when AI agents, which I am passionate about, are starting to receive attention – is truly an honour. For me, the AI chatbot is a medium of art, so I hope my work can convey the artistic aspect of large language models to everyone.”
Yuqian’s project was completed in collaboration with Chenhang Cheng, Chuyan Xu, Cory Lee, and Jun Peng, with music produced by Yufan Xie and the character contribution from Niq. This project was created using the Needle Tool.
“The Lumen Prize has been an aspiration of mine since my undergraduate days. To receive it now — especially at a time when AI agents, which I am passionate about, are starting to receive attention — is truly an honour.”
Yitong Sun, meanwhile, won Best Paper Award 2023 at the International Conference on Interactive Media, Smart Systems and Emerging Tech (IMET) in Barcelona, for his paper ‘ReSenv: A realistic earthquake simulation environment based on Unreal Engine.’
Yitong’s PhD research focuses on using AI to improve and innovate colour rendering methods, lighting settings, and interactive modalities within Virtual Reality (VR) systems to mitigate negative side effects, such as motion sickness or dry eye syndrome. His techniques have also been applied to VR applications for disaster relief, such as for earthquake rescue training and fire evacuation simulations.
His paper introduced an innovative earthquake simulation environment using the Chaos Physics System in Unreal Engine. As his paper highlights, earthquakes have a profound impact on human lives and economic activities, making efficient search and rescue operations paramount to reducing losses. As AI and robotics gain traction in rescue missions, the demand for high-quality simulated visual data grows. Existing quake simulation techniques mainly target individual building damage, lacking realism in multi-building urban settings.
This approach delivers high-resolution visual and synthetic scenario data for AI and robotic rescue missions. It leverages the game engine's prowess to achieve photo-realistic rendering, precise physical interactions, and three-degree-of-freedom geological movements. This efficient and user-centric approach surpasses traditional simulation tools. The game's environment offers unparalleled detail and realism, becoming a valuable data resource for AI training in pathfinding and image recognition for earthquake rescue. His paper proves the utility of this method across three AI tasks: similarity detection, path planning and image segmentation.
“Winning this award [...] showcases that new technologies and AI are not just about enhancing the precision and usability of quake simulations but crucially, they stand as pivotal tools in saving lives during disasters.”
“Winning this award reflects the deep understanding of the prolonged severe impacts earthquakes have on lives, culture, and the economy” Yitong says. “It also showcases that new technologies and AI are not just about enhancing the precision and usability of quake simulations but crucially, they stand as pivotal tools in saving lives during disasters. This recognition fuels our ambition to further break boundaries and better serve humanity.”
“Looking ahead, I plan to expand the scope of disaster simulations to include floods and wildfires and integrate interactive training through VR technology, aspiring for them to play a substantive role in real-world disaster rescues in the future.”
Professor Dr Hala Mansour, Head of Doctoral Programmes at the RCA, extended her congratulations to both students:
""Heartfelt congratulations to Yitong and Yuqian on receiving the awards for the outstanding conference paper. Your dedication to research and quality of academic contribution have thoroughly shone through. This recognition is a testament to your hard work and scholarly excellence. We are at RCA encourage students to present their research in conferences and build their academic community.""",2486,,Royal College of Art,20.4,,2350,2486,rca.ac.uk,,0:00,,,United Kingdom,"news, alumni and faculty",4.556383766353727,0.5478359908883826,878,False,2486,"Computer Science Research Centre PhD students recognised for their work in AI | Royal College of Art

19 December 2023 London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine us more about your academic journey before you joined LSHTM to study a research degree?
Before joining LSHTM, I studied law at Birkbeck University of London, the University of Law in Bloomsbury, and then the University of Bristol. I undertook an undergraduate law degree (LLB) at Birkbeck at the age of 29. I then went on to do a Graduate Diploma in Law at the University of Law, more commonly known as the Legal Practice Course (LPC); the course previously required to undertake a training contract to become a solicitor. After completing the LPC I trained to be a solicitor and a couple of years after that, I undertook a legal masters (LLM) in Health, Law and Society at the University of Bristol.
What barriers would you say you have you faced during your education?
I started university later than most and with no A-levels, so it was definitely a shock to the system to come back into education after such a long time away from it! I was the first person in my family to go to university. I do not come from a wealthy family and often experienced poverty growing up, along with additional family difficulties that can sometimes stem from poverty. I was not always able to access the same opportunities when growing up as those in middle-class or wealthy families, and further and higher education wasn’t really seen as important, so I started to work full-time after leaving school at 16. Unfortunately, coming from a certain socio-economic background such as mine, did sometimes mean encountering barriers in higher education. This could be from people making assumptions about my (non-posh) accent and lack of confidence in articulating my ideas in seminars, to me myself questioning whether I deserved to be there. Finally, I also have dyslexia and dyspraxia so that means I have had to do a lot of adapting and working longer hours.
What advice would you give to help someone overcome similar challenges?
You absolutely can do it and you absolutely deserve to be here. Make sure to tap into the support services, and make sure you get all the reasonable adjustments you need in order for you to be able to study in the best way possible. Find your people, don’t study on your own. Having support networks and study groups or just regular meet-ups to discuss work is massively important, necessary even, for your own sanity, wellbeing and motivation. If there are extra pots of money available; hardship funds, scholarships, or any other financial assistance, go for it. I couldn’t have done what I have without scholarships, bursaries and hardship funds. Also, don’t be afraid of contacting people to network. Some of the opportunities I have been met with are due to me contacting other academics and having chats over Zoom. People are usually pretty friendly, especially if you are into their research - be brave!
Explain your research topic in one sentence.
Historical research, looking at access to healthcare in prisons in England and Wales from 1996 to 2021.
How did you apply for your research degree?
I submitted my own proposal, and applied via a scholarship opportunity at The Centre for History in Public Health at LSHTM.
How did you make your application stand out from other applicants?
By showing that I really understood the area I wanted to research, that no one else had undertaken this research before and that my research would be of interest to a number of academic schools, as well as have the potential to produce research outputs which are accessible to the public and have the potential to shape future policy.
How have the barriers you’ve faced shaped your academic and personal development?
It’s made me more resilient, confident and it has also made me manage my time and deadlines better. It’s made my world bigger, changed my worldview, provided me with critical thinking skills, made me better at speaking, articulating my own ideas to people, listening to others, speaking with groups and speaking in public. Also, being able to face barriers, overcome them and/or adapt to them, and see things through to the end with good results, does give you a massive sense of achievement and makes you realise that you can do hard things.
How are you finding your research so far?
I get to read every day about a subject that I am deeply passionate about, so I feel very, very lucky. It’s been extremely interesting so far, I feel like I have learnt so much already.
What are your plans for after your research degree?
I have some further research ideas relating to my current research project, so it would be amazing to get further funding to do some post-doctoral research. I also would like to develop and teach a module on the carceral determinants of health.
What advice would you give to someone considering applying for your course at LSHTM?
LSHTM is a very supportive environment and a good place to undertake a PhD. Be familiar with your subject matter. In preparation, do background research in the area you want to undertake research. Contact and speak with potential supervisors (I found this extremely helpful). Finally, it always helps to undertake research in an area that you are interested in and passionate about.",2334,,London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,1.7,,870,2334,lshtm.ac.uk,,0:00,,,United Kingdom,media,4.452845869132936,0.4955849889624724,920,False,2334,"From school leaver to solicitor to health researcher: Alice's story | LSHTM

From school leaver to solicitor to health researcher: Alice's story
19 December 2023 London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine us more about your academic journey before you joined LSHTM to study a research degree?
Before joining LSHTM, I studied law at Birkbeck University of London, the University of Law in Bloomsbury, and then the University of Bristol. I undertook an undergraduate law degree (LLB) at Birkbeck at the age of 29. I then went on to do a Graduate Diploma in Law at the University of Law, more commonly known as the Legal Practice Course (LPC); the course previously required to undertake a training contract to become a solicitor. After completing the LPC I trained to be a solicitor and a couple of years after that, I undertook a legal masters (LLM) in Health, Law and Society at the University of Bristol.
What barriers would you say you have you faced during your education?
I started university later than most and with no A-levels, so it was definitely a shock to the system to come back into education after such a long time away from it! I was the first person in my family to go to university. I do not come from a wealthy family and often experienced poverty growing up, along with additional family difficulties that can sometimes stem from poverty. I was not always able to access the same opportunities when growing up as those in middle-class or wealthy families, and further and higher education wasn’t really seen as important, so I started to work full-time after leaving school at 16. Unfortunately, coming from a certain socio-economic background such as mine, did sometimes mean encountering barriers in higher education. This could be from people making assumptions about my (non-posh) accent and lack of confidence in articulating my ideas in seminars, to me myself questioning whether I deserved to be there. Finally, I also have dyslexia and dyspraxia so that means I have had to do a lot of adapting and working longer hours.
What advice would you give to help someone overcome similar challenges?
You absolutely can do it and you absolutely deserve to be here. Make sure to tap into the support services, and make sure you get all the reasonable adjustments you need in order for you to be able to study in the best way possible. Find your people, don’t study on your own. Having support networks and study groups or just regular meet-ups to discuss work is massively important, necessary even, for your own sanity, wellbeing and motivation. If there are extra pots of money available; hardship funds, scholarships, or any other financial assistance, go for it. I couldn’t have done what I have without scholarships, bursaries and hardship funds. Also, don’t be afraid of contacting people to network. Some of the opportunities I have been met with are due to me contacting other academics and having chats over Zoom. People are usually pretty friendly, especially if you are into their research - be brave!
Explain your research topic in one sentence.
Historical research, looking at access to healthcare in prisons in England and Wales from 1996 to 2021.
How did you apply for your research degree?
I submitted my own proposal, and applied via a scholarship opportunity at The Centre for History in Public Health at LSHTM.
How did you make your application stand out from other applicants?
By showing that I really understood the area I wanted to research, that no one else had undertaken this research before and that my research would be of interest to a number of academic schools, as well as have the potential to produce research outputs which are accessible to the public and have the potential to shape future policy.
How have the barriers you’ve faced shaped your academic and personal development?
It’s made me more resilient, confident and it has also made me manage my time and deadlines better. It’s made my world bigger, changed my worldview, provided me with critical thinking skills, made me better at speaking, articulating my own ideas to people, listening to others, speaking with groups and speaking in public. Also, being able to face barriers, overcome them and/or adapt to them, and see things through to the end with good results, does give you a massive sense of achievement and makes you realise that you can do hard things.
How are you finding your research so far?
I get to read every day about a subject that I am deeply passionate about, so I feel very, very lucky. It’s been extremely interesting so far, I feel like I have learnt so much already.
What are your plans for after your research degree?
I have some further research ideas relating to my current research project, so it would be amazing to get further funding to do some post-doctoral research. I also would like to develop and teach a module on the carceral determinants of health.

Graduation, while a significant milestone, is just the beginning. It’s essential for students to contemplate their future paths early on, whether that means delving deeper into legal expertise or venturing into the job market.
35% of law graduates go straight into employment, whilst just under 12% continue further education. Having completed the rigorous journey of a law degree, graduates can feel overwhelmed by the choices that lie ahead.
Let's break down some options and potential paths for those with a new law degree.
1. The Conventional Path: Becoming a Solicitor or Barrister
Solicitor:
- Path: You would typically need to undertake the Legal Practice Course (LPC). A training contract with a law firm follows this.
- Skills Gained: The LPC equips you with the practical skills to work in a law firm, such as client communication, drafting legal documents, and developing your understanding of legal processes.
Barrister:
- Path: The Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) is the next step for aspiring barristers. After this, one must secure a 'pupillage' (akin to an apprenticeship) at a set of chambers.
- Skills Gained: The BPTC focuses on advocacy and equips you with skills for presenting cases in court, cross-examining witnesses, and understanding court etiquette.
2. Which Further Studies Can Lead You to Diverse Career Paths?
Finance & Banking:
Real Estate:
Management & Consultancy:
- Common Roles: Management Consultant, Business Analyst.
- Further Studies: An MBA or a specialised management course would be beneficial. Law graduates bring critical thinking and structured problem-solving skills, invaluable in consulting roles.
Human Resources:
Public Sector & NGOs:
- Common Roles: Policy Analyst, Public Affairs Consultant.
- Further Studies: Masters in Public Administration (MPA) or courses in public policy can be taken. Legal graduates can navigate the complexities of regulations and policy frameworks effectively.
3. Academia: Masters, PhD, and Beyond
If you're passionate about the scholarly aspect of law, delving deeper into academic studies is rewarding.
- Masters in Law (LLM): This offers specialisations in areas like international law, human rights law, and commercial law.
- PhD in Law: For those keen on research, contributing original knowledge to the field, and potentially entering the world of academia as law professors.
Final Thoughts
Your postgraduate journey is dependent on your career aspirations. It's imperative to identify your interests, be it in the legal world or beyond. Different paths will need different skills and qualifications, but the foundational knowledge from a law degree offers a unique advantage.

Ripple Effects: The Global Economic Impact of the US Election
The 2024 US Presidential race was one of the most divisive and controversial election showdowns in recent history and the stakes couldn’t be higher for America. Now Donald Trump has been elected, what will the outcome mean for the rest of the world? Will the global economy be the real loser?
This session offered a unique opportunity to gain the latest insights from our world-leading faculty. The following topics will be covered:
Market Volatility
Policy Changes
Consumer Confidence
Investment Decisions
Trade Policies/Trade Tariffs
Eco-Chic: Sustainability in the luxury sector
As we become more conscious of sustainable spending, the balance between luxury and sustainability can define our choices. Luxury items are, by their very nature, additional to, rather than integral to, what we need to live our lives well. The current appetite for fast fashion has shone a light on the many advantages of luxury. Luxury goods are designed and hand-crafted by artisans and are durable, made of robust, high-quality materials – a clear contrast with low-cost, throwaway items.
Is this enough to give luxury the sustainability credentials that could reinforce and widen its appeal to increasingly sustainability-focused consumers? What can we learn from brand leaders in this space? How do consumers ensure that they are being ethical in their behaviour?
The discussion covered:
How brands can lead by example and successfully integrate sustainable business models and practices
How to be an ethical consumer
Sustainability as a core identity at the heart of a brand
How can business increase consumers’ willingness to pay for sustainable goods?
Can business models be adapted to be less reliant on volume growth?
ATMs to Algorithms: Assessing Tech’s Influence in Finance
As the digital revolution continues to move at pace, are we embracing technology with blind faith? In an era where algorithms trade stocks, chatbots handle customer inquiries, Robo-advisers are on the rise, cryptocurrencies still battle to offer an alternative to traditional currencies and decentralization, the financial sector is undergoing a profound transformation. The increasing reliance of technology brings unprecedented opportunities as well as challenges to a sector that must navigate risk successfully.
Does the use of technology bring a secure and efficient financial system or is it opening the door to a set of risks that outweigh the relative benefits? Is the digital revolution a trusted ally or a lurking adversary?
Traditional to Trailblazing: Strategies for Mid-Career Transition
Many of us are asking ourselves profound questions about the work we do. Rewarding work drives social bonds and connectivity and keeps us mentally and physically alert, while studies show that long-periods of worklessness has the opposite effect, especially if finances are restricted. Yet, the work that you do in your 20s and 30s may not be the work you want to do in your 40s and 50s. Passions change, and life events can influence the need or aspiration to pursue a different course. The pandemic proved the impetus for thousands of people to make work pivots and in the age of the 100-year life, career change may be more common, but society is still entrenched in the old linear path and not yet programmed to support new work and life structures. So, how can you shed the fear and emotional stress of trying something new?
London Business School‘s upcoming think ahead event, From Traditional to Trailblazing: Strategies for Mid-Career Transition will provide you with practical strategies to support you through a successful mid-career change, learning from global industry practitioners with real-world experience. Our London Business School Faculty will present world-leading academic research to guide you as you trailblaze the future of work, and help you navigate mid-career changes with more optimism, creativity, and success.
The event will feature Herminia Ibarra, Charles Handy Chair in Organisational Behaviour; Professor of Organisational Behaviour, at London Business School; Kurt Budge, Mining Executive/Former CEO, Registered Forrest Yoga Teacher, Executive Coach in training; Russell Jones, ex-Army captain turned artist, and will be moderated by Sarah Gordon, Visiting Professor in Practice at the LSE, former Business Editor, Financial Times, former CEO at the Impact Investing Institute, and will cover:
- What makes career change so difficult?
- Is there a bias to overcome in pursuing a non-traditional career path?
- Strategies to face sustainable and successful mid-career change with optimism and creativity
- Will this be the future of work?
Leading with Purpose in Turbulent Times
Hear recommendations and suggestions from leading London Business School faculty and global industry practitioners on how best to manage teams through instability, volatility and stress. Discovering the best way forward will be as crucial as understanding what actions and reactions to avoid as you strive to keep employees engaged and motivated in turbulent times.
Professor Randall S. Peterson, Professor of Organisational Behaviour at London Business School and Academic Director of the Leadership Institute hosted this unmissable and lively discussion. Randall was joined by David Faro, Associate Professor at London Business School; Priya Mande JEMBA2002, CEO of a Stealth Biotech with 30 years of experience across Pharma and Biotech; and Chris Averill, Leadership and Business Coach.
The Road to COP28 – Aligning Expectations with Actions
Hear from LBS faculty, alumni and other global experts and practitioners, as they came together to discuss the synergies, challenges, opportunities and trade-offs that need to be considered and balanced when tackling climate change.
Core topics that were explored include:
- The role of business schools in meeting the climate challenge
- Business expectations of COP28
- Meeting the challenges of climate regulation and finance, energy transition and climate transition
- A view from Dubai on the road to COP28
- Complex climate trade-offs
How will AI innovation in healthcare improve our lives?
Global healthcare challenges are complex and diverse and advances in AI could save millions of lives. AI is transforming the healthcare industry by refining diagnostic and monitoring capabilities and improving access to health services and information in both the developed and the developing world. AI has also been instrumental in the development of health management systems, as well as contributing to cutting-edge research which has led to human trials of AI-designed drugs.
How do these advances improve lives in the developed and developing world? What are the common challenges and points of difference? Will AI take us closer to the 100-year life?
Julian Birkinshaw, Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship and Vice-Dean at London Business School was joined by Professor Nicos Savva, Professor of Management Science and Operations at London Business School; Crystal Ruff, Senior Director Neuroscience and Vaccines at Takeda; Barbara Domayne-Hayman, Entrepreneur-in-residence, Francis Crick Institute; and Andrew Vallance-Owen, CMO Medicover AB. The panel discussed the outlook, opportunities and challenges of AI in healthcare in the developed and developing world.
The Business Implications of AI
While Generative AI is all the rage, the way it will impact business is still up for grabs. Yet it is clear that a number of sectors – from advertising to education to healthcare - will be challenged, and business models will be upended, while the opportunity landscape may be uneven. Our expert panel looked at which sectors and business models are most likely to be impacted, and how organisations can better prepare.
Professor Michael G Jacobides, a member of the WEF’s AI Alliance, joined Giuseppe Stigliano, CEO of Spring Studios, who sees the advertising world being transformed by the creative side of AI, as well as Arka Dhar (SLN2022), Product Lead at OpenAI and Clare Mortimer, IBM’s Business Transformation Services Leader for UK & Ireland to discuss the outlook, opportunities and challenges of AI for business. The panel also covered the strategies and leadership required to navigate the new landscape.

Issues and uncertainties in the global economy
With the global economy under multiple inter-connected pressures - from war and climate change to inflation and supply chain disruption - understanding the impact and outlook for business is difficult. Our esteemed panel, including Professor Richard Portes, Professor Lucrezia Reichlin, Professor Jérémie Gallien, and Professor Nicos Savva, explored the challenges and opportunities of the global economic landscape for business. Moderated by Eshe Nelson, Business and Economics Reporter at The New York Times, this wide-ranging discussion covered issues including: deglobalisation, monetary policy, inflation, cryptocurrency, decentralised finance, AI and supply chain.
How to achieve breakthrough growth
Our first think ahead event took place at our Regent’s Park Campus on Tuesday 23 May 2023, where our world-class panel, comprised of leading faculty and business practitioners, discussed Breakthrough growth and how to achieve it.
Growth is at the heart of every firm’s ambitions, but how do you move beyond incremental gains to achieve breakthrough growth in tough economic times? From macro-economic and lifestyle trends, to consumer-led disruption and innovation breakthroughs, this event, with leading London Business School faculty, explored the opportunities for businesses to achieve breakthrough growth.
Our panel also discussed the internal environment needed to exploit these opportunities, from making the right strategic choices, to creating the optimal culture and leadership for achieving growth. Professor Julian Birkinshaw, Adjunct Associate Professor Helen Edwards, Adjunct Professor Linda Yueh and Chris McCarthy, Director at MedTech EMEA Johnson & Johnson, explored breakthrough growth from a national and global viewpoint. James Hurley, Enterprise Editor at The Times, moderated the conversation.

The discussion covered:
How brands can lead by example and successfully integrate sustainable business models and practices
How to be an ethical consumer
Sustainability as a core identity at the heart of a brand
How can business increase consumers’ willingness to pay for sustainable goods?
Can business models be adapted to be less reliant on volume growth?
ATMs to Algorithms: Assessing Tech’s Influence in Finance
As the digital revolution continues to move at pace, are we embracing technology with blind faith? In an era where algorithms trade stocks, chatbots handle customer inquiries, Robo-advisers are on the rise, cryptocurrencies still battle to offer an alternative to traditional currencies and decentralization, the financial sector is undergoing a profound transformation. The increasing reliance of technology brings unprecedented opportunities as well as challenges to a sector that must navigate risk successfully.
Does the use of technology bring a secure and efficient financial system or is it opening the door to a set of risks that outweigh the relative benefits? Is the digital revolution a trusted ally or a lurking adversary?
Traditional to Trailblazing: Strategies for Mid-Career Transition
Many of us are asking ourselves profound questions about the work we do. Rewarding work drives social bonds and connectivity and keeps us mentally and physically alert, while studies show that long-periods of worklessness has the opposite effect, especially if finances are restricted. Yet, the work that you do in your 20s and 30s may not be the work you want to do in your 40s and 50s. Passions change, and life events can influence the need or aspiration to pursue a different course. The pandemic proved the impetus for thousands of people to make work pivots and in the age of the 100-year life, career change may be more common, but society is still entrenched in the old linear path and not yet programmed to support new work and life structures. So, how can you shed the fear and emotional stress of trying something new?
London Business School‘s upcoming think ahead event, From Traditional to Trailblazing: Strategies for Mid-Career Transition will provide you with practical strategies to support you through a successful mid-career change, learning from global industry practitioners with real-world experience. Our London Business School Faculty will present world-leading academic research to guide you as you trailblaze the future of work, and help you navigate mid-career changes with more optimism, creativity, and success.
The event will feature Herminia Ibarra, Charles Handy Chair in Organisational Behaviour; Professor of Organisational Behaviour, at London Business School; Kurt Budge, Mining Executive/Former CEO, Registered Forrest Yoga Teacher, Executive Coach in training; Russell Jones, ex-Army captain turned artist, and will be moderated by Sarah Gordon, Visiting Professor in Practice at the LSE, former Business Editor, Financial Times, former CEO at the Impact Investing Institute, and will cover:
- What makes career change so difficult?
- Is there a bias to overcome in pursuing a non-traditional career path?
- Strategies to face sustainable and successful mid-career change with optimism and creativity
- Will this be the future of work?
Leading with Purpose in Turbulent Times
Hear recommendations and suggestions from leading London Business School faculty and global industry practitioners on how best to manage teams through instability, volatility and stress. Discovering the best way forward will be as crucial as understanding what actions and reactions to avoid as you strive to keep employees engaged and motivated in turbulent times.
Professor Randall S. Peterson, Professor of Organisational Behaviour at London Business School and Academic Director of the Leadership Institute hosted this unmissable and lively discussion. Randall was joined by David Faro, Associate Professor at London Business School; Priya Mande JEMBA2002, CEO of a Stealth Biotech with 30 years of experience across Pharma and Biotech; and Chris Averill, Leadership and Business Coach.
The Road to COP28 – Aligning Expectations with Actions
Hear from LBS faculty, alumni and other global experts and practitioners, as they came together to discuss the synergies, challenges, opportunities and trade-offs that need to be considered and balanced when tackling climate change.
Core topics that were explored include:
- The role of business schools in meeting the climate challenge
- Business expectations of COP28
- Meeting the challenges of climate regulation and finance, energy transition and climate transition
- A view from Dubai on the road to COP28
- Complex climate trade-offs
How will AI innovation in healthcare improve our lives?
Global healthcare challenges are complex and diverse and advances in AI could save millions of lives. AI is transforming the healthcare industry by refining diagnostic and monitoring capabilities and improving access to health services and information in both the developed and the developing world. AI has also been instrumental in the development of health management systems, as well as contributing to cutting-edge research which has led to human trials of AI-designed drugs.
How do these advances improve lives in the developed and developing world? What are the common challenges and points of difference? Will AI take us closer to the 100-year life?
Julian Birkinshaw, Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship and Vice-Dean at London Business School was joined by Professor Nicos Savva, Professor of Management Science and Operations at London Business School; Crystal Ruff, Senior Director Neuroscience and Vaccines at Takeda; Barbara Domayne-Hayman, Entrepreneur-in-residence, Francis Crick Institute; and Andrew Vallance-Owen, CMO Medicover AB. The panel discussed the outlook, opportunities and challenges of AI in healthcare in the developed and developing world.
The Business Implications of AI
While Generative AI is all the rage, the way it will impact business is still up for grabs. Yet it is clear that a number of sectors – from advertising to education to healthcare - will be challenged, and business models will be upended, while the opportunity landscape may be uneven. Our expert panel looked at which sectors and business models are most likely to be impacted, and how organisations can better prepare.
Professor Michael G Jacobides, a member of the WEF’s AI Alliance, joined Giuseppe Stigliano, CEO of Spring Studios, who sees the advertising world being transformed by the creative side of AI, as well as Arka Dhar (SLN2022), Product Lead at OpenAI and Clare Mortimer, IBM’s Business Transformation Services Leader for UK & Ireland to discuss the outlook, opportunities and challenges of AI for business. The panel also covered the strategies and leadership required to navigate the new landscape.

Issues and uncertainties in the global economy
With the global economy under multiple inter-connected pressures - from war and climate change to inflation and supply chain disruption - understanding the impact and outlook for business is difficult. Our esteemed panel, including Professor Richard Portes, Professor Lucrezia Reichlin, Professor Jérémie Gallien, and Professor Nicos Savva, explored the challenges and opportunities of the global economic landscape for business. Moderated by Eshe Nelson, Business and Economics Reporter at The New York Times, this wide-ranging discussion covered issues including: deglobalisation, monetary policy, inflation, cryptocurrency, decentralised finance, AI and supply chain.
How to achieve breakthrough growth
Our first think ahead event took place at our Regent’s Park Campus on Tuesday 23 May 2023, where our world-class panel, comprised of leading faculty and business practitioners, discussed Breakthrough growth and how to achieve it.
Growth is at the heart of every firm’s ambitions, but how do you move beyond incremental gains to achieve breakthrough growth in tough economic times? From macro-economic and lifestyle trends, to consumer-led disruption and innovation breakthroughs, this event, with leading London Business School faculty, explored the opportunities for businesses to achieve breakthrough growth.
Our panel also discussed the internal environment needed to exploit these opportunities, from making the right strategic choices, to creating the optimal culture and leadership for achieving growth. Professor Julian Birkinshaw, Adjunct Associate Professor Helen Edwards, Adjunct Professor Linda Yueh and Chris McCarthy, Director at MedTech EMEA Johnson & Johnson, explored breakthrough growth from a national and global viewpoint. James Hurley, Enterprise Editor at The Times, moderated the conversation.

This article was written by Dr Kingsley Marshall, Head of the School of Film & Television at Falmouth University. Kingsley is leading Falmouth's contribution to the Charismatic consortium, a new project exploring AI driven story telling for screens.
For so much of my life artificial intelligence has only ever been a feature of science fiction: often as a creative plot device or even a character to pose questions of the viewer and reader about the fundamentals of what it is to be human.
And yet more than 40 years later, I am about to embark on a research project that examines how generative AI tools can be used by creatives. And central to the project is not just AI’s practical application and the new creative opportunities it could unlock, but also those familiar philosophical questions about what humanity is and the relationship between us and technology.
So how did I get here and how will it inform the work I do with my colleagues from , Channel 4, University of the Arts London and Aardman Animations, as well as the creatives we will consult with along the way?
Born in the 1970s, Star Wars movies and Buck Rogers serials that played in a Saturday Kids Cinema Club that ran in my local Odeon were my gateway to sci-fi. A family treat was a trip to the local video rental store, and friends at secondary school were quick to share VHS collections that (occasionally) strayed beyond what we were permitted to see in the cinema.
The school yard trade opened the door to indie and global cinema, and an increasingly provocative line in science fiction that tackled big ideas. In 1983 I became a tiny bit obsessed with the movie War Games, a cold war classic based on (kind of) true events where a teenage hacker engages with a military supercomputer. A year later the movie Threads dropped on TV, depicting a nuclear attack on Sheffield. I had the cover of that week’s Radio Times, with a bandaged traffic warden toting a rifle, on my wall. You get the picture.
Despite these films’ seemingly exotic locations and characters, I made connections with my lived experience. The mining ships and factories that formed the backdrop of Alien spoke to the decline around me in post-industrial Britain. The environmental and biodiversity collapse of the evening news was well-represented in Blade Runner’s Los Angeles setting.
The militarised cops, populist politics, and the powerful voices of corporate tech bros of RoboCop and Total Recall resonate even more today than they did when they were released: what is Tesla’s Cybertruck if not a lift from a sci-fi production designer’s scrapbook?!
Having inevitably made my way to academia, working in the School of Film & Television at Falmouth gives me the opportunity to share and talk through the ideas of complex philosophical films with like-minded people. The films spark great discussion, often driven by students connecting with the situation presented to the characters and how these ideas of the future relate to our own varied lived experiences.
I’ve written about a lot of TV and film over the last decade or so, and I’ve run over a hundred masterclasses with filmmakers, from first-time filmmakers to Academy Award winners across pretty much all of the roles in film and TV. But I’ve never strayed too far from that original passion for science fiction and have sometimes managed to combine the two.
A couple of years ago I began a run of work that returned to this theme. I edited a collection on Black Mirror, with my own chapter focused on the use of AI technology. The release of Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049 gave me the space to write about machine consciousness. But it was the HBO reimagining of Westworld that provided the path to this latest project.
A paper I wrote on Westworld drew the attention of a creative AI company in the UK. We shared similar views, and spoke about how ideas could potentially be realised through emergent AI technologies. As I approached a few tech companies around the world and other broadcasters and studios, we were able to secure some funding to ‘make real’ some of these ideas through a research and development project - which is now being backed by Innovate UK, to ensure AI is at the heart of the future economy.
Since April 2024 I’ve taken my ideas of the contextual representation of AI on screen, into a project that considers the application of a bespoke AI in creative spaces with other screen creatives. I’m heading up a team at Falmouth including filmmakers Dr Rachael Jones and Scott Barley, working with our partners and digital sociologist and tech ethicist Lisa Talia Moretti.
We’ve been working through some of the creative problems presented by the use of emergent technology in the screen industries. We’re developing and testing tools that can augment this work in a consortium focused on making an intervention that works in conjunction with creative practitioners, empowering underrepresented voices and, ultimately, creating new forms of story.
We’ll also be looking at potential new business models to ensure creatives are paid for their ideas and work.

As LBS marks its 60th anniversary, we will explore the challenges facing leaders - and how to tackle them - in The Second Sixty
Sustaining business growth while respecting the climate, harnessing tech transformations, adapting to increased automation, navigating political instability, cultivating ethical leadership and driving innovation. These are significant global challenges facing the world of business.
So, how can leaders prepare, and how is London Business School’s (LBS) community working to tackle these challenges?
This year, LBS is marking its 60th anniversary, celebrating six decades of excellence in business education and looking ahead to The Second Sixty.
Originally known as the London Graduate School of Business with just 36 students, LBS has grown to offer 11 degree programmes across London and Dubai campuses, reaching over 12,000 participants annually through Executive Education programmes and online courses.
As the School celebrates its past and looks towards the next sixty years, its world-class faculty, alumni, students and staff will explore six global challenges that businesses and society are likely to face in The Second Sixty.
Businesses must transform from being a drain on planetary resources to sustainable innovators. To meet sustainability targets and increasing consumer expectations, businesses will need to balance growth with the demands of a rapidly changing climate and resource challenges. This includes tackling resource depletion and shifting to a circular economy.
New sustainability reporting requirements will also affect businesses of all sizes. Various parts of the world have new reporting standards, and companies can no longer ignore these. Those who shift from a mindset that treats sustainability reporting purely as a compulsory add-on to one that views it as an opportunity to innovate through new products and services stand to gain a real competitive advantage.
From sustainable finance, ESG issues, and renewable energy to the green skills gap and sustainable innovation, we’ll look at the strategies businesses can adopt and the leadership needed to rise to this pressing challenge.
During the previous wave of AI transformation, Big Tech firms, including Google, Amazon and Netflix, rewrote their strategy playbooks by focusing on deep learning and Large Language Models. Then, in December 2022, OpenAI released its latest AI chatbot, ChatGPT, to great acclaim.
Generative AI has immense transformative potential, but we have yet to see its widespread integration into business strategy.
Leaders must address this challenge now if they are to remain competitive in the decades ahead. They must focus on cultivating new business models that harness tech advancements, going beyond simply using technology as a bolt-on and redesigning strategy from the ground up.
We’ll take a closer look at how businesses can harness technological advances to ensure equitable growth and sustainability over the next 60 years.
As the population in many parts of the world grows older, technology gets newer and has an outsize impact on people’s lives. With automation and AI continuing to reshape career paths and skillsets, businesses must support and adapt to changing workforce needs.
Navigating the fundamental shift in where, how (and, indeed why) we work will require thoughtful investment in reskilling initiatives, equitable employment policies and greater flexibility in work arrangements and benefits – all while ensuring competitiveness and meeting stakeholder expectations in an increasingly technology-driven economy.
From human sustainability, upskilling and career longevity to redesigning work for a flexible future, we’ll look at the practicalities involved and how businesses can make this shift.
An ancient Chinese curse says, “May you live in interesting times,” and there is no doubt that we live in such times today. From Donald Trump’s threat to impose swingeing trade tariffs in his second term of office to war and conflicts in Ukraine, Africa and the Middle East, geopolitical uncertainty is the greatest concern for businesses with a global footprint.
In the coming decades, business will play a critical role in addressing risks to the stability of global economies and financial systems. But what steps can leaders take to mitigate risks arising from economic and political uncertainty over the next 60 years, and how should they prepare for a world increasingly affected by cross-border challenges?
We’ll approach this global challenge from numerous angles, from future-proofing businesses and supply chains to navigating unforeseen events.
Building solid relationships between leaders and the workforce will be key to managing the wholesale transitions necessary in the years ahead. This will ensure that employees are confident in embracing new technologies and ways of working.
Trust is the foundation of any relationship. In business, it starts with ethical leadership, fostering integrity and a strong organisational culture to navigate ethical dilemmas and ensure diversity and accountability.
Additionally, societies are increasingly intolerant of unethical decision-making by power elites, corruption and authoritarianism. Businesses must support equality and shared prosperity goals to maintain social stability and avoid consumer backlash.
What are the practicalities of building trust and retaining a motivated and productive workforce as we shift to fundamentally different ways of doing things? And how can leaders best ensure they’re leading with ethics in an ever-changing and complex global environment?
We’ll explore how businesses can maintain and embed ethical leadership, from building and leading diverse organisations to adapting to demographic shifts and changing societal values.
The confluence of wars and conflicts, potential trade wars, economic uncertainty, and fluctuating market conditions is creating challenges for businesses that can seem overwhelming.
Organisations must develop the capacity to respond proactively to these disruptions to survive and adapt. This means building resilience – the ability to deal with the unexpected and pivot quickly when conditions dictate – into the foundations of the business.
Businesses need to harness innovation and agile strategies to compete in increasingly unpredictable and interconnected global markets.
From delivering agile innovation and strategies for the future of finance to leveraging technology for competitive advantage, we’ll examine how businesses can navigate the evolving challenges of the global economy and grow in the coming decades.

Some 34 MBA students recently gathered at the Düsseldorf campus of WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management for one purpose: to create new AI models centered around their own ideas and interests. At the debut edition of the school’s WHU CustomGPT Makerthon, programming skills intersected with the latest happening in AI development, providing participants with the opportunity to test their creative skills and explore the diverse ways AI technology is applied within a corporate context.
The program’s agenda offered WHU students a wide range of opportunities to explore the topic of AI. In addition to workshops, where they could create effective prompts for neural networks, the WHU CustomGPT Makerthon also offered a crash course on generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) for business applications. GPTs are neural network models that use a transformer architecture, an important advancement in the field of artificial intelligence that allow applications such as ChatGPT to work properly.
During this crash course, participants formed teams, collected ideas, and refined and implemented them as GPTs. The resulting ideas ranged from an assistant that helps students formulate and validate topics for their theses to a customized GPT for communicating with current and future WHU students.
“After custom GPTs were introduced a few months ago, today, we had the opportunity to optimize our own under the guidance of experts and to explore their potential. It is impressive to see what is already possible with GPTs after such a short time,” said Jens Bonger, member of the school’s MBA class of 2024. Naga Jyothi Bonam, a graduate of WHU’s Part-Time MBA Program, was also enthusiastic about the new possibilities she discovered at the Makerthon: “With CustomGPTs, the power of AI can be used quickly and creatively. And anyone who learns how to create CustomGPTs is already at a competitive advantage.”
In the GreenGenie project, the participants presented a solution intended to support companies in meeting ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) and SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) requirements. They also developed a political campaign agent designed to strategically sway more voters.
In addition to the practical side of things, the event also covered the theoretical and featured numerous inspiring speeches from industry experts, including Edip Saliba, Data and AI Sales Leader at Microsoft, who discussed the integration of OpenAI models in Microsoft products. Ibrahim Halil Kalkan from GELSENWASSER AG spoke about the legal and ethical challenges and considerations when using generative AI. Dr. Wolfgang Runge, Managing Director at Accenture Operations, highlighted current trends in and perspectives on AI technology and gave advice on its application in academic and professional environments. There was even a speaker from Silicon Valley present: Guido Appenzeller from Andreessen Horowitz provided concrete insights into the dynamic advances made in generative AI and discussed investment strategies based on current market trends.
The first WHU CustomGPT Makerthon was initiated by Professor Stefan Spinler, Head of the Kühne Institute for Logistics Management at WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management, and Hamidreza Hosseini, lecturer at WHU. “The event represents an important step in the promotion of innovative ideas and the associated collaboration at WHU,” said Professor Spinler.

Is OpenAI's Chatbot going to make us all redundant, then enslave us? Or is it just a human productivity tool? LBS experts weigh in
On 29 March this year, The New York Times carried an open letter from more than 1,000 tech leaders, researchers and others calling for a six-month moratorium on the development of “the most powerful artificial intelligence systems”. Claiming that AI tools presented “profound risks to society and humanity”, the letter declared that AI developers are “locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict or reliably control”.
Given the controversy surrounding what is, after all, a chatbot, we challenged three faculty to sort the hype from the hope.
First launched in November 2022, ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI. It’s based on GTP-3 (generative pre-trained transformer), an LLM that utilises a novel neural-network architecture that was trained on a massive amount of text (everything that can be found on the internet.) As its name suggests, GPT-3 is the third iteration of the model; a fourth iteration, GPT-4, was officially launched on 13 March 2023 and is accessible with a paid subscription or through its integration with Bing, Microsoft’s search engine. A number of competing chatbots have been created by tech giants such as Meta (LlaMA) and Google (Bard); tech startups such as Google-backed Anthropic AI (Claude) and Amazon-backed Hugging Face (Bloom); and universities such as Stanford (Alpaca).
What has made ChatGPT and its competitors such a hot topic is their ability to communicate in a manner that shows human-like understanding of language and context, showing knowledge and ability to reference examples across diverse domains and adapt their prose to mimic human diction. Their success has surprised even industry insiders – it seems that the sheer size of the models and the quantity and diversity of the data they were trained on has enabled a level of performance never before seen in computer-generated language. However, ChatGPT and other AI tools are still subject to “hallucinations”; the term used by the AI community to describe the scenario where a chatbot errs by “inventing” a fact that doesn’t exist.
Now, over to our faculty…
ChatGPT can help us do a lot of things. It’s great for writing emails and can help us program computers and so on, but there’s a consensus among the scientific community that this is not “general” intelligence at this stage of its development. It’s a fantastic productivity tool and those who learn how to use it will have an edge in the workplace, but one frontier yet to be crossed is to do with sensory-motor capabilities. That’s about the ability to assess the physical environment, interact with it and learn from it. Large-language models (LLMs) are not designed for that purpose; AI researchers believe that, if you could embed that capability, you would get much closer to human intelligence.

“What really strikes you is the capability to imitate humans”
Writing in The New Yorker last February, sci-fi author Ted Chiang likened ChatGPT to “a blurry jpeg of the web”, which I think is a very good simile. It retains much of the information on the internet, but in the same way that a jpeg retains much of the information of a higher-resolution image – it compresses the information, so what you get is an approximation of the web. If you have access to the internet, how much use is a blurry image of it? This is why, in its current version, ChatGPT should not be used as a factual source of information.
Like most people, I had a moment of shock when I first used ChatGPT. What really strikes you is the capability to imitate humans. Our species is fascinated by what resembles us, and we often attribute human traits to non-human entities due to our anthropomorphic bias. This may help explain why ChatGPT has become a social phenomenon as much as it has a technological advancement. My guess is that, even if it feels like a breakthrough now, in time to come ChatGPT will seem like another step in an evolution of technology that a gradual alignment of the planets has enabled.
I believe it’s crucial to understand how we got here: there’s been a constant build-up in the past 20 years and one factor is human capital. We have trained more and more engineers and scientists in computer science and STEM fields, and researchers have developed open-source, standardised tools and built on each other’s research to get to this point. We have seen an implicit alliance between academia and the technology sector, and companies have been investing in very efficient computing infrastructure with high scalability.
We may be seeing the appearance of a new ecosystem and people will build many applications in the same way, for example, that smartphones gave rise to a new creative generation. This could lead to the emergence of a new type of business – app-based platforms, for example – that can connect with users, so LLMs could become the go-to platform for entrepreneurs to create new applications, and many corporations are thinking about how to leverage the technology in customer services.
Different companies have their own take on this. Meta AI, for example, has been much more open with its LLM, LLaMA. It has not released it as a public chatbot like ChatGPT, but as an open-source library of models to which anyone in the AI community can request access. Meta’s strategy, or so it claims, is to make the tool available, explain how it works, and make it completely open to users and the research community.
OpenAI’s strategy seems a bit more ambiguous. ChatGPT is “open” in the sense that it can be used now (with safety measures), for which OpenAI charges a fee. The company shares what the algorithm is doing to some extent, but not much is actually known or understood about it. OpenAI’s CEO believes we should not have a fully open-source AI universe because of its potential for harm. This is a trade-off: the more open-source we are and the more transparency we have with respect to how the algorithm is built, the more accessible the technology is to a wider range of stakeholders. But, if it’s completely open-source, people of malign intent may repurpose the tool for illegal activities.
There’s another question around ease of replication: to what extent is there a barrier to entry for a company, institution or individual who wants to build their own LLM? How easy is it to do this? We need more research in this area. Researchers from Stanford University recently claimed to have developed a small AI language model on a budget of less than $1,000. It’s an interesting study because, if the results are confirmed, it would mean that the barrier to entry is not that great. But I’m sceptical – I think there will be a first-mover advantage for the big techs because they have massive computing infrastructure and huge volumes of data and human feedback. (Shortly after its release, the Stanford University research team took down their LLM due to misinformation and rising costs.)
Anyone may be able to develop an AI tool cheaply, but that tool may not be trustworthy and may have more limitations. The real difficulty is to catch the ‘edge’ cases, such as when the tool is offensive or racist. The barrier to entry lies in the extent to which we can replicate the fine-tuning that these platforms have been engaged in, which is a non-trivial task. If we can’t replicate the models easily, we risk ending up in the hands of the tech giants, who will have a first-mover advantage and will capture much of the value added.
I’m less concerned about whether the robots will take over, become the masters and make us their slaves than I am about the divide between the people who are the consumers of AI – by which I mean individuals but also corporations and countries – and the AI “masters” who develop and own the technology and capture the value added. History tells us that significant disruption in technology can give rise to inequality. I believe it’s the job of policymakers to manage technological advancement to curb its tendency to produce inequality.
It’s clear that AI is going to be both a potential source of good and a potential source of harm, but I think the fact that it is so widely talked about is a positive development. My hope is that the discussion stirred by the ChatGPT phenomenon will inform political debate and there will be discourse around how we manage the technology to try to ensure that it is a force for good.
Most new technologies don’t have that big an impact and tend to fade away; maybe only 1% or 2% are genuinely transformative. I believe these large-language models are transformative and are going to have an impact on everything we do. Like personal computers in the 1980s and the internet in the 1990s, this is a technology that’s going to change the world.
The next iteration of the OpenAI model, GTP-4, is even more transformative because it’s multimodal. It doesn’t just take text prompts – it can process pictures and videos and can respond to queries by providing pictures as well as text. That means it will be able to interact with the world around us pretty much like us humans do – we don’t just interact via language; we interact via visual cues and audio cues. We are multimodal and the technology is becoming multimodal, too.
This will have huge implications for complementary technology. Take, for example, Google Glass, a brand of smart glasses developed by Google that appeared around 10 years ago. It disappeared as quickly as it came, but not because there was anything wrong with the technology – it was simply that its live video feeds weren’t processed in such a way as to generate useful insights. That’s going to change with the advent of these LLMs. The way we interact with our computers will also change fundamentally.
Currently, we use a mouse and a keyboard. We may still do so, but they will be secondary – inputting instructions by typing text on a keyboard and moving a mouse around will increasingly feel like the Stone Age. The technology is transformational not only because of what it’s able to do, but also because it enables existing complementary technology to become a lot more useful and to be adopted at a much faster pace.
In terms of the world of work, it’s hard to say what it’s not going to impact – but it’s also difficult to say exactly how it will do so. It’s going to be picked up very quickly and is currently being integrated into all sorts of programs. Many people worry about AI automating jobs and replacing humans, but I don’t think that’s right. AI doesn’t automate jobs; it automates tasks.
A typical job involves many tasks – if it only involves a limited number of tasks that are all amenable to automation, it will cease to exist. Most jobs, however, are an amalgamation of different tasks and some will be more amenable to automation than others. For these, technology will be used progressively to improve the productivity of the worker, which frees time for more value-adding activities. For example, if you’re a doctor, you probably spend a lot of time doing note-keeping and back- office work.
“In terms of worrying whether these models are taking over the world, I don’t think we’re there yet”
As the tools are refined, you’ll spend less time on such activities and more on interacting with patients to understand their problems. That’s a big gain in human productivity and adds value in terms of human interaction. On the other hand, a job in healthcare that probably won’t exist in a few years’ time is medical-notes coding. Currently, people take patients’ notes, often given orally or in writing, then convert them into codes that are used for reimbursement and quality management. Startups are developing ChatGPT applications that do this well, so that’s one job that’s probably going to disappear.
Any tool, especially a tool that involves reducing the barriers to collecting and synthesising information, has good uses and bad uses, but I don’t think it’s fundamentally different to any other technology – it’s just on a bigger scale. It’s therefore crucially important that we develop such technology responsibly and by adding safety layers (known as “guardrails” in the industry). Nevertheless, there’s a concern that someone may train a new model from scratch without such guardrails.
The competition between tech companies makes this scenario more likely, but it is even more likely when it comes to competition between nations. In terms of worrying whether these models are taking over the world, I don’t think we’re there yet. This is not general intelligence – it’s just a clever chatbot. In his book AI Narratives – A History of Imaginative Thinking about Intelligent Machines, published in 2020, philosopher Stephen Cave argues that our preoccupation with AI taking over the world essentially stems from a Western mindset, and that this preoccupation with power and domination is a relatively modern construct. Cave makes the point that perhaps AI will adopt a more Eastern philosophical perspective – an enlightenment mindset rather than a power-seeking one. That’s a thought I find comforting.
When GPT-4 was released, Oklahoma-based branding designer Jackson Greathouse Fall tasked it with making as much money as possible on a budget of $100 (£82), documenting the progress on his Twitter feed. He instructed the chatbot to be “as verbose as possible [in] making decisions for everything” and required that the solution must not involve any manual labour in order to see if AI could create a successful online business. It created , a discovery website for “Eco-Friendly Products & Tips for Sustainable Living”.
By the end of day one, the website had attracted investment of $100. Within a week, thanks in part to Twitter marketing and direct messages, the website had generated $1,378.84 ($878.84 previous balance + $500 new investment) in cash and the company was valued at $25,000 on the back of the $500 investment for a 2% stake. “I am but a humble servant of the Robots,” opined Greathouse Fall. While this example lit up the Twittersphere, there have been innumerable more humble applications by “ordinary” people (see ‘35 Ways Real People Are Using A.I. Right Now’; The New York Times, 13 April 2023.)
Ioannis Ioannou, Associate Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship
What we’ve seen with the launch of ChatGPT is a step change in technology. What’s truly remarkable about it is its accessibility. Compared to previous ground-breaking technological innovations, such as the internet itself (which required a degree of know-how in order to use it in the early days), ChatGPT is by design ready to go straight out of the box – it’s accessible, it’s conversational and it doesn’t require any technical expertise. The fact that it’s instantly accessible makes its implications hard to predict, yet they will be wide-ranging and profound, both for our personal and our professional lives.
This technology is going to bring about a quantum shift in human efficiency; whether it’s from performing mundane tasks, such as answering emails, or more advanced tasks, like negotiating rules and regulations. It’s an important complement to human ability - but not a substitute for it. Consider the following example. Recently I wanted to better understand the implications of new guidance from the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), a government department that promotes competitive markets and tackles unfair competitive behaviour.
The new guidance allows companies some flexibility to collaborate on climate-change initiatives without breaching anti-competitive laws. It is legal guidance, using specialised legal language and (unless you’re a competition lawyer) fully understanding its provisions is not straightforward. So, I started a conversation with ChatGPT, after sharing the wording of the new guidance, and refined my questions as I went along. This iterative process enabled me to understand a relatively complex legal document and its implications way faster and arguably much better than if I had performed the research without the tool. Had I done it on my own, it’s likely that I would not have fully grasped the dense legal language, let alone appreciate the full implications of the guidance.
Of course, ChatGPT didn’t make me an instant expert, but it simplified the legal jargon and allowed me to generate (and verify) a more informed, justifiable view in a domain in which I’m not an expert.
Extend the example above to sustainability and you quickly see a potential multiplier effect. Take one key current issue: integrating ESG considerations into investment strategies. About half of all global investments are invested in passive funds; more specifically, large sums of money are invested in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a vehicle commonly used to implement passive investment strategies. A number of these are very old (the oldest are up to 30 years old).
The question is, how do you integrate ESG considerations into the investment decisions of these ETFs? This is not only a technical question but also a legal one, because you need regulatory approval to change the investment mandate of an existing ETF. This gives rise to all sorts of implementation challenges. What kind of approvals are required and from whom? How easy is it to get those approvals?
“I also think companies should encourage their employees to learn new technology and leverage it, rather than fear it”
Clearly, it’s not a simple process as it involves multiple steps and requires the approval of various stakeholders. Here, a tool such as ChatGPT could be extremely helpful for understanding both the process as well as the potential bottlenecks, and developing a strategy to change the mandate and integrate ESG. From an academic point of view, understanding this process and its underlying complexities is also important because it would (partially) explain why capital markets in general, and passive funds more specifically, have been relatively slow to integrate ESG into their investment processes.
With regard to the impact on business more broadly, I think what we will see is that the most forward-looking, long-term oriented companies, rather than banning ChatGPT in the workplace, will come up with creative and innovative ways to embrace it – or, at the very least, experiment with it. They will allow their employees – especially in industries in which there are immediate applications, such as marketing, communications and PR, and which produce a wealth of documents on a daily basis – full licence to experiment with the tools to automate many routine tasks. I also think companies should encourage their employees to learn new technology and leverage it, rather than fear it, as long as they have safeguards in place with regard to privacy and cyber security.
We are just starting to uncover the potential of this technology. One could list a plethora of domains that will be disrupted by tools like ChatGPT; the reality is, they will fundamentally transform industries. However, I’m encouraged by the fact that extensive testing is underway. I also believe it’s a good thing that tools such as ChatGPT were not given immediate access to the entire internet, thus avoiding misinformation and interventions by bad actors. Instead, they have been introduced under relatively controlled conditions to ensure we identify and hopefully address any defects and biases. I’m also encouraged and excited by the fact that the release of ChatGPT has sparked intense competition between the tech giants such as Google and Microsoft, among others.
I believe this is shaping up to be a race to the top, although I fully acknowledge the need to remain cautious and put guardrails in place as these technologies develop rapidly. That’s why I remain cautiously optimistic. At the very least, I can see the potential for tremendous efficiency gains but also their potential, as productivity tools, to turbocharge other, more creative tasks such as ideation and brainstorming. I foresee a future in which this is another tool, albeit a very powerful one that, in the same way that the internet did when it first emerged, can drive all of us forward.

Is OpenAI's Chatbot going to make us all redundant, then enslave us? Or is it just a human productivity tool? LBS experts weigh in
On 29 March this year, The New York Times carried an open letter from more than 1,000 tech leaders, researchers and others calling for a six-month moratorium on the development of “the most powerful artificial intelligence systems”. Claiming that AI tools presented “profound risks to society and humanity”, the letter declared that AI developers are “locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict or reliably control”.
Given the controversy surrounding what is, after all, a chatbot, we challenged three faculty to sort the hype from the hope.
First launched in November 2022, ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI. It’s based on GTP-3 (generative pre-trained transformer), an LLM that utilises a novel neural-network architecture that was trained on a massive amount of text (everything that can be found on the internet.) As its name suggests, GPT-3 is the third iteration of the model; a fourth iteration, GPT-4, was officially launched on 13 March 2023 and is accessible with a paid subscription or through its integration with Bing, Microsoft’s search engine. A number of competing chatbots have been created by tech giants such as Meta (LlaMA) and Google (Bard); tech startups such as Google-backed Anthropic AI (Claude) and Amazon-backed Hugging Face (Bloom); and universities such as Stanford (Alpaca).
What has made ChatGPT and its competitors such a hot topic is their ability to communicate in a manner that shows human-like understanding of language and context, showing knowledge and ability to reference examples across diverse domains and adapt their prose to mimic human diction. Their success has surprised even industry insiders – it seems that the sheer size of the models and the quantity and diversity of the data they were trained on has enabled a level of performance never before seen in computer-generated language. However, ChatGPT and other AI tools are still subject to “hallucinations”; the term used by the AI community to describe the scenario where a chatbot errs by “inventing” a fact that doesn’t exist.
Now, over to our faculty…
ChatGPT can help us do a lot of things. It’s great for writing emails and can help us program computers and so on, but there’s a consensus among the scientific community that this is not “general” intelligence at this stage of its development. It’s a fantastic productivity tool and those who learn how to use it will have an edge in the workplace, but one frontier yet to be crossed is to do with sensory-motor capabilities. That’s about the ability to assess the physical environment, interact with it and learn from it. Large-language models (LLMs) are not designed for that purpose; AI researchers believe that, if you could embed that capability, you would get much closer to human intelligence.

“What really strikes you is the capability to imitate humans”
Writing in The New Yorker last February, sci-fi author Ted Chiang likened ChatGPT to “a blurry jpeg of the web”, which I think is a very good simile. It retains much of the information on the internet, but in the same way that a jpeg retains much of the information of a higher-resolution image – it compresses the information, so what you get is an approximation of the web. If you have access to the internet, how much use is a blurry image of it? This is why, in its current version, ChatGPT should not be used as a factual source of information.
Like most people, I had a moment of shock when I first used ChatGPT. What really strikes you is the capability to imitate humans. Our species is fascinated by what resembles us, and we often attribute human traits to non-human entities due to our anthropomorphic bias. This may help explain why ChatGPT has become a social phenomenon as much as it has a technological advancement. My guess is that, even if it feels like a breakthrough now, in time to come ChatGPT will seem like another step in an evolution of technology that a gradual alignment of the planets has enabled.
I believe it’s crucial to understand how we got here: there’s been a constant build-up in the past 20 years and one factor is human capital. We have trained more and more engineers and scientists in computer science and STEM fields, and researchers have developed open-source, standardised tools and built on each other’s research to get to this point. We have seen an implicit alliance between academia and the technology sector, and companies have been investing in very efficient computing infrastructure with high scalability.
We may be seeing the appearance of a new ecosystem and people will build many applications in the same way, for example, that smartphones gave rise to a new creative generation. This could lead to the emergence of a new type of business – app-based platforms, for example – that can connect with users, so LLMs could become the go-to platform for entrepreneurs to create new applications, and many corporations are thinking about how to leverage the technology in customer services.
Different companies have their own take on this. Meta AI, for example, has been much more open with its LLM, LLaMA. It has not released it as a public chatbot like ChatGPT, but as an open-source library of models to which anyone in the AI community can request access. Meta’s strategy, or so it claims, is to make the tool available, explain how it works, and make it completely open to users and the research community.
OpenAI’s strategy seems a bit more ambiguous. ChatGPT is “open” in the sense that it can be used now (with safety measures), for which OpenAI charges a fee. The company shares what the algorithm is doing to some extent, but not much is actually known or understood about it. OpenAI’s CEO believes we should not have a fully open-source AI universe because of its potential for harm. This is a trade-off: the more open-source we are and the more transparency we have with respect to how the algorithm is built, the more accessible the technology is to a wider range of stakeholders. But, if it’s completely open-source, people of malign intent may repurpose the tool for illegal activities.
There’s another question around ease of replication: to what extent is there a barrier to entry for a company, institution or individual who wants to build their own LLM? How easy is it to do this? We need more research in this area. Researchers from Stanford University recently claimed to have developed a small AI language model on a budget of less than $1,000. It’s an interesting study because, if the results are confirmed, it would mean that the barrier to entry is not that great. But I’m sceptical – I think there will be a first-mover advantage for the big techs because they have massive computing infrastructure and huge volumes of data and human feedback. (Shortly after its release, the Stanford University research team took down their LLM due to misinformation and rising costs.)
Anyone may be able to develop an AI tool cheaply, but that tool may not be trustworthy and may have more limitations. The real difficulty is to catch the ‘edge’ cases, such as when the tool is offensive or racist. The barrier to entry lies in the extent to which we can replicate the fine-tuning that these platforms have been engaged in, which is a non-trivial task. If we can’t replicate the models easily, we risk ending up in the hands of the tech giants, who will have a first-mover advantage and will capture much of the value added.
I’m less concerned about whether the robots will take over, become the masters and make us their slaves than I am about the divide between the people who are the consumers of AI – by which I mean individuals but also corporations and countries – and the AI “masters” who develop and own the technology and capture the value added. History tells us that significant disruption in technology can give rise to inequality. I believe it’s the job of policymakers to manage technological advancement to curb its tendency to produce inequality.
It’s clear that AI is going to be both a potential source of good and a potential source of harm, but I think the fact that it is so widely talked about is a positive development. My hope is that the discussion stirred by the ChatGPT phenomenon will inform political debate and there will be discourse around how we manage the technology to try to ensure that it is a force for good.
Most new technologies don’t have that big an impact and tend to fade away; maybe only 1% or 2% are genuinely transformative. I believe these large-language models are transformative and are going to have an impact on everything we do. Like personal computers in the 1980s and the internet in the 1990s, this is a technology that’s going to change the world.
The next iteration of the OpenAI model, GTP-4, is even more transformative because it’s multimodal. It doesn’t just take text prompts – it can process pictures and videos and can respond to queries by providing pictures as well as text. That means it will be able to interact with the world around us pretty much like us humans do – we don’t just interact via language; we interact via visual cues and audio cues. We are multimodal and the technology is becoming multimodal, too.
This will have huge implications for complementary technology. Take, for example, Google Glass, a brand of smart glasses developed by Google that appeared around 10 years ago. It disappeared as quickly as it came, but not because there was anything wrong with the technology – it was simply that its live video feeds weren’t processed in such a way as to generate useful insights. That’s going to change with the advent of these LLMs. The way we interact with our computers will also change fundamentally.
Currently, we use a mouse and a keyboard. We may still do so, but they will be secondary – inputting instructions by typing text on a keyboard and moving a mouse around will increasingly feel like the Stone Age. The technology is transformational not only because of what it’s able to do, but also because it enables existing complementary technology to become a lot more useful and to be adopted at a much faster pace.
In terms of the world of work, it’s hard to say what it’s not going to impact – but it’s also difficult to say exactly how it will do so. It’s going to be picked up very quickly and is currently being integrated into all sorts of programs. Many people worry about AI automating jobs and replacing humans, but I don’t think that’s right. AI doesn’t automate jobs; it automates tasks.
A typical job involves many tasks – if it only involves a limited number of tasks that are all amenable to automation, it will cease to exist. Most jobs, however, are an amalgamation of different tasks and some will be more amenable to automation than others. For these, technology will be used progressively to improve the productivity of the worker, which frees time for more value-adding activities. For example, if you’re a doctor, you probably spend a lot of time doing note-keeping and back- office work.
“In terms of worrying whether these models are taking over the world, I don’t think we’re there yet”
As the tools are refined, you’ll spend less time on such activities and more on interacting with patients to understand their problems. That’s a big gain in human productivity and adds value in terms of human interaction. On the other hand, a job in healthcare that probably won’t exist in a few years’ time is medical-notes coding. Currently, people take patients’ notes, often given orally or in writing, then convert them into codes that are used for reimbursement and quality management. Startups are developing ChatGPT applications that do this well, so that’s one job that’s probably going to disappear.
Any tool, especially a tool that involves reducing the barriers to collecting and synthesising information, has good uses and bad uses, but I don’t think it’s fundamentally different to any other technology – it’s just on a bigger scale. It’s therefore crucially important that we develop such technology responsibly and by adding safety layers (known as “guardrails” in the industry). Nevertheless, there’s a concern that someone may train a new model from scratch without such guardrails.
The competition between tech companies makes this scenario more likely, but it is even more likely when it comes to competition between nations. In terms of worrying whether these models are taking over the world, I don’t think we’re there yet. This is not general intelligence – it’s just a clever chatbot. In his book AI Narratives – A History of Imaginative Thinking about Intelligent Machines, published in 2020, philosopher Stephen Cave argues that our preoccupation with AI taking over the world essentially stems from a Western mindset, and that this preoccupation with power and domination is a relatively modern construct. Cave makes the point that perhaps AI will adopt a more Eastern philosophical perspective – an enlightenment mindset rather than a power-seeking one. That’s a thought I find comforting.
When GPT-4 was released, Oklahoma-based branding designer Jackson Greathouse Fall tasked it with making as much money as possible on a budget of $100 (£82), documenting the progress on his Twitter feed. He instructed the chatbot to be “as verbose as possible [in] making decisions for everything” and required that the solution must not involve any manual labour in order to see if AI could create a successful online business. It created , a discovery website for “Eco-Friendly Products & Tips for Sustainable Living”.
By the end of day one, the website had attracted investment of $100. Within a week, thanks in part to Twitter marketing and direct messages, the website had generated $1,378.84 ($878.84 previous balance + $500 new investment) in cash and the company was valued at $25,000 on the back of the $500 investment for a 2% stake. “I am but a humble servant of the Robots,” opined Greathouse Fall. While this example lit up the Twittersphere, there have been innumerable more humble applications by “ordinary” people (see ‘35 Ways Real People Are Using A.I. Right Now’; The New York Times, 13 April 2023.)
Ioannis Ioannou, Associate Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship
What we’ve seen with the launch of ChatGPT is a step change in technology. What’s truly remarkable about it is its accessibility. Compared to previous ground-breaking technological innovations, such as the internet itself (which required a degree of know-how in order to use it in the early days), ChatGPT is by design ready to go straight out of the box – it’s accessible, it’s conversational and it doesn’t require any technical expertise. The fact that it’s instantly accessible makes its implications hard to predict, yet they will be wide-ranging and profound, both for our personal and our professional lives.
This technology is going to bring about a quantum shift in human efficiency; whether it’s from performing mundane tasks, such as answering emails, or more advanced tasks, like negotiating rules and regulations. It’s an important complement to human ability - but not a substitute for it. Consider the following example. Recently I wanted to better understand the implications of new guidance from the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), a government department that promotes competitive markets and tackles unfair competitive behaviour.
The new guidance allows companies some flexibility to collaborate on climate-change initiatives without breaching anti-competitive laws. It is legal guidance, using specialised legal language and (unless you’re a competition lawyer) fully understanding its provisions is not straightforward. So, I started a conversation with ChatGPT, after sharing the wording of the new guidance, and refined my questions as I went along. This iterative process enabled me to understand a relatively complex legal document and its implications way faster and arguably much better than if I had performed the research without the tool. Had I done it on my own, it’s likely that I would not have fully grasped the dense legal language, let alone appreciate the full implications of the guidance.
Of course, ChatGPT didn’t make me an instant expert, but it simplified the legal jargon and allowed me to generate (and verify) a more informed, justifiable view in a domain in which I’m not an expert.
Extend the example above to sustainability and you quickly see a potential multiplier effect. Take one key current issue: integrating ESG considerations into investment strategies. About half of all global investments are invested in passive funds; more specifically, large sums of money are invested in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a vehicle commonly used to implement passive investment strategies. A number of these are very old (the oldest are up to 30 years old).
The question is, how do you integrate ESG considerations into the investment decisions of these ETFs? This is not only a technical question but also a legal one, because you need regulatory approval to change the investment mandate of an existing ETF. This gives rise to all sorts of implementation challenges. What kind of approvals are required and from whom? How easy is it to get those approvals?
“I also think companies should encourage their employees to learn new technology and leverage it, rather than fear it”
Clearly, it’s not a simple process as it involves multiple steps and requires the approval of various stakeholders. Here, a tool such as ChatGPT could be extremely helpful for understanding both the process as well as the potential bottlenecks, and developing a strategy to change the mandate and integrate ESG. From an academic point of view, understanding this process and its underlying complexities is also important because it would (partially) explain why capital markets in general, and passive funds more specifically, have been relatively slow to integrate ESG into their investment processes.
With regard to the impact on business more broadly, I think what we will see is that the most forward-looking, long-term oriented companies, rather than banning ChatGPT in the workplace, will come up with creative and innovative ways to embrace it – or, at the very least, experiment with it. They will allow their employees – especially in industries in which there are immediate applications, such as marketing, communications and PR, and which produce a wealth of documents on a daily basis – full licence to experiment with the tools to automate many routine tasks. I also think companies should encourage their employees to learn new technology and leverage it, rather than fear it, as long as they have safeguards in place with regard to privacy and cyber security.
We are just starting to uncover the potential of this technology. One could list a plethora of domains that will be disrupted by tools like ChatGPT; the reality is, they will fundamentally transform industries. However, I’m encouraged by the fact that extensive testing is underway. I also believe it’s a good thing that tools such as ChatGPT were not given immediate access to the entire internet, thus avoiding misinformation and interventions by bad actors. Instead, they have been introduced under relatively controlled conditions to ensure we identify and hopefully address any defects and biases. I’m also encouraged and excited by the fact that the release of ChatGPT has sparked intense competition between the tech giants such as Google and Microsoft, among others.
I believe this is shaping up to be a race to the top, although I fully acknowledge the need to remain cautious and put guardrails in place as these technologies develop rapidly. That’s why I remain cautiously optimistic. At the very least, I can see the potential for tremendous efficiency gains but also their potential, as productivity tools, to turbocharge other, more creative tasks such as ideation and brainstorming. I foresee a future in which this is another tool, albeit a very powerful one that, in the same way that the internet did when it first emerged, can drive all of us forward.

10.07.2019The importance of balancing rights with security and the changes in multinational commerce are topics covered in two postgraduate law courses launched by the University of Northampton.
Applications are now being invited for the LLM Multinational Corporate Law and LLM Transnational Rights and Security one-year programmes, which will commence in September.
LLM Programme Leader, Dr Simon Sneddon, said: “It is really exciting to be able to offer two brand new programmes, and we are pleased that this latest stage in the continuous development of our postgraduate offer is now ready.
“As well as finding employment in the UK, graduates from our previous LLM programmes have progressed to careers across the world, from India and Nigeria to Colombia and Thailand. They now work in positions as varied as legal secretary, corporate assessor, charity director, the police and education.”
The Master’s in Transnational Rights and Security will appeal to graduates in Law, Criminology and International Relations and reflects the needs of students, employers and society.
The importance of balancing rights and security is very much a 21st Century global issue, and are considered in the programme. The 2015 terrorist attack on the Bataclan nightclub, in Paris, is one such instance where the balance of rights and security were put to the test.
The firearms used were supplied by organised crime groups and moved from Slovenia to France via Germany and Montenegro; the act itself was triggered by perceptions of religious intolerance and violations of human rights; the perpetrators fled across international borders, requiring international legal cooperation and the response was to bolster national security measures plus airstrikes on Raqqa by French Air Force. These are all areas and aspects which are considered in this programme, which also draws on information developed by members of the programme team for the UNODC Education for Justice (E4J) programme on Firearms Crime.
The Master’s in Multinational Corporate Law, meanwhile, emphasises key elements of 21st Century multinational commerce. As globalisation increases, and with changes in trading relationships which may come about as a result of geopolitical factors, it is crucial for those running and working at higher levels within a business to have an understanding of the legal ramifications of business decisions. To succeed, those in business need to understand legal issues around international, regional and national laws on intellectual property rights, patents and copyright; the environmental impacts of different manufacturing and transport practices; the legal business environments which exist in different areas; the rights and obligations of employees at all levels of the business; competing contractual obligations where commercial contracts are concluded across national boundaries; and laws which govern moving goods by sea.

What will the next 12 months bring? Our experts share their suggestions for a positive, prosperous business year
While the business world seems more unpredictable than ever, with global economic worries, communities broken through two wars and the environment under threat from climate change, the year ahead is starting to come into focus. What lies ahead? Some of our experts at London Business School consider what’s to come and how we might make sense of this next chapter in these uncertain times.
Nicos Savva, Professor of Management Science and Operations
Last year was, without a doubt, the year of generative AI. New Large Language Models, such as ChatGPT, and image generation models like MidJourney, took the world by storm. In 2024, we can expect the trend of these models becoming increasingly capable to continue. More importantly, I believe this will be the year when generative AI starts making a profound impact on the way we conduct business.
Catalysed by ever-improving model performance, including the ability of models to utilise external tools, reduced usage costs, and advancements in addressing data security and privacy concerns, we will witness an explosion of applications. A zoo of 'co-pilots' is already in the works. These will be fine-tuned instances of generative AI, tailored to provide support in specific knowledge-based domains of work, ranging from architecture and accounting to medicine, law, and academia. These co-pilots, varying in quality and usefulness, may initially pose challenges in value assessment and adoption decisions, but market forces will soon sort this out.
Furthermore, I expect business processes to begin adapting to better integrate generative AI. This includes everything from customer service centres rewriting service provision protocols to back-office operations, such as contract monitoring being redesigned to reduce or eliminate reliance on human labour. In education, online classrooms will customise teaching experiences for each student based on their performance and prior knowledge. This development of alternative ways of working will arguably enable generative AI to reach its true potential and have an effect as profound as the technology itself.
Moreover, 2024 will likely see a shift in the narrative, from AI as a replacement for human labour to AI as an enabler of human potential. The synergy between human intelligence and AI's capabilities will be crucial in maximising these technologies' benefits for the betterment of humanity.
Linda Yueh, Adjunct Professor of Economics
As global economic growth decelerates to 2.9% while inflation won’t return to 2% until 2025, according to the International Monetary Fund’s latest forecasts, it seems that 2024 will be a challenging year since interest rates are likely to remain ‘restrictive’ at least in the first part of the year that will elevate risks associated with debt. But, that’s not the only source of risk, 2024 is also the biggest year for elections in history. More than half of the world’s population, over 4 billion people, will go to the polls, such as in the US, EU, UK, India, Taiwan, among many others including Africa. The elections could add to geo-economic risk, which refers to economics being affected by geo-politics, since these elections could result in re-alignments of foreign policies that in turn impact economic policies.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB), the global body that monitors systemic risk in international financial markets, has pointed out that nearly half of global assets ($239.3 trillion) are now found in the shadow banking sector, which is broader than but includes private credit. Formally known as the non-bank financial institutions, this sector is less closely regulated than banks, which is why the FSB and major central banks have expressed concerns that shadow banks could pose a systemic risk to the global economy.
A case in point is China, whereby its trust industry, part of shadow banking, has experienced contagion from the property sector’s woes. The trust industry, worth about $3 trillion in a narrow definition, has recently seen two major trusts fail to make payments they owe to investors due to their significant exposure to the property market. The property crisis is spilling over from banks to shadow banks, which increases the chances of a systemic crisis in the world’s second largest economy and a major engine of global growth.
Additionally, 2024 could see re-alignment of geo-politics which could result in policy shifts, including that of the US but also by other countries toward the US or China or away from both toward the non-aligned camp. For instance, the impact on supply chains could be significant. Businesses have already been reconfiguring their global value chains to avoid trade and investment restrictions as well as respond to technological change and consumer preferences. This uncertainty will be heightened in 2024, which could delay much needed investments in a sluggish world economy.
In summary, businesses should keep their antennas attuned to systemic and geo-economic risks. But, they should also bear in mind the importance of positioning themselves for the eventual upturn.

2023 was a difficult year for business, with a flat economy, inflation at a 30-year high, and massive geopolitical uncertainty. Across the developed world consumer confidence is low and the investment environment is unpredictable. Looking into 2024, business leaders are therefore taking a cautious view, with most companies holding back on hiring and capital investment.
What’s going to happen in 2024? It's entirely possible there will be further nasty shocks. But the optimist in me is expecting a stabilisation of the geopolitical situation, a bottoming-out of the economic cycle and a gradual return of consumer confidence. Inflation is under control again, jobs are being created (especially in the US), and governments are seeking to stimulate investment.
I wrote a short piece this time last year, arguing that we had reached the end of the “cycle of disruption” wrought by crazy entrepreneurs (Elon Musk, Masa Son, Adam Neumann, Sam Bankman Fried) and populist politicians (you know who). I was half-correct, in that today’s politicians and business people seem content to play within the rules once more, but it's clear that the threat of disruption hasn’t gone away. Populists have been elected in Italy, Argentina and Holland. Trump is riding high in the polls.
Turning to some more specific trends, 2023 was the year of Generative AI, with many observers predicting that the business world would never be the same again. I think this is nonsense. Generative AI is a cool productivity-enhancer, and it will have a profound long-term impact on how we access and process information. But it won’t be as disruptive as the Internet or smartphone. For most companies it will be what we call a “sustaining innovation” – it will reinforce rather than undermine their competitive position. This will start to become clear in 2024.
Sustainability was high on the corporate agenda in 2023 and will continue to be in 2024. Through a combination of consumer and social pressure, new reporting standards, and government regulation, there is huge pressure on CEOs to turn their sustainability pledges into action. 2023 was the first time investment in renewable energy ($1.1 trillion) exceeded the amount spent on carbon-based energy. Several major industries, including energy and automobiles, have arguably reached the tipping point in their push for sustainable ways forward.
My final prediction for 2024. The workplace revolution is in full swing, and we can expect more companies to experiment with four-day weeks, creative employment models, and hybrid work patterns. For their part, individuals will be looking for more fulfilling work and for opportunities to make career shifts all the way through. The opportunity to turn ‘lifelong learning’ from aspiration to reality may finally be with us.

Businesses are gearing up for a transformative year as climate risk takes center stage. Companies are acknowledging the urgent need to adapt to environmental challenges – either because they face financially material environmental risks themselves or because current and future regulation will significantly impact their businesss. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in Europe is designed to combat carbon leakage. It imposes carbon costs on certain imports, compelling businesses to account for their carbon footprint. As this regulation unfolds, businesses will be compelled to reassess their supply chains and operational strategies.
A seismic shift towards transparency is underway, with businesses of all sizes and industries bracing for greater scrutiny on sustainability practices. The EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) comes into effect in 2024 -- it will amplify the trend for all businesses operating in Europe (except for small firms with less than 250 employees and €20 million in assets or revenue) to extend reporting obligations beyond publicly listed giants, impacting businesses across industries and mandating, for example, an accurate measuring of a businesses carbon footprint worldwide. Companies will need to integrate sustainability considerations into their core strategies, not only to comply with regulations but to meet the rising expectations of an environmentally conscious public.
Beyond regulatory frameworks, stakeholders, from investors to consumers, are increasingly emphasising sustainability outcomes. The concern of greenwashing looms, pushing businesses to communicate and disclose their sustainability strategies transparently. Our recent research at London Business School highlights the surge in ESG disclosures within the private equity sector. Our findings underscore a compelling link – private equity firms voluntarily disclosing more about ESG strategies achieve superior sustainability outcomes. This signals a broader trend where businesses, even in fairly unregulated sectors, will likely be better off prioritising authentic communication and action on sustainability to meet the expectations of discerning stakeholders.
As geopolitical crises and climate change strain government finances, businesses find themselves at the intersection of policy evolution. Governments, grappling with fiscal challenges, have to strike a delicate balance between raising tax revenues and fostering a competitive business landscape. The year 2024 is poised to witness dynamic shifts in tax policies as several elections loom globally, potentially bringing new leadership advocating for both higher and lower business taxes and tax incentives that impact businesses.
Adding to this complexity is the ongoing implementation of the OECD's historic global tax reform featuring a 15% minimum tax. This reform, targeting multinational firms with revenues exceeding €750 million, is already finding its way into domestic laws. The landscape of corporate taxation is undergoing a paradigm shift, demanding businesses to recalibrate their financial strategies. The impact will be profound, transcending borders and reshaping the dynamics of corporate financial citizenship.

As we look towards 2024, it seems that a much gloomier landscape awaits us – with ongoing wars, instability, discord, and epoch marking elections looming in the UK, Europe and USA.
Numerous writers and counsellors advocate a digital detox, new deep-work habits, changing the channel, avoiding social media and being more aware of its impact on our mood and our sense-making. Maybe we need more walking, talking and listening to one another? More time spent reading and less social-media feeding.
Fully immersing ourselves in a time management horizon that has real breadth and meaning, not just the next impending milestone, might be the answer. It might feel more possible to do that at the start of a new year, but we need to be armed with more than just some new resolutions. We often explore this in classes at LBS, the profundity found in Andrew Scott and Lynda Gratton’s The Hundred Year Life, and the need for managers and mid-lifers to learn again, to re-invest in “intangible assets” (dormant friendships, new relationships) as well as monitoring our health and our tangible wealth.
A good touchstone for this new more optimistic way of looking at the world in 2024, might be through reappraising how we look at our working lives. Before 2019, working from home was a rare privilege, which often needed to be grudgingly “approved”. Employers were reluctant to unleash the autonomy genie of flexible working. Now, hybrid, remote and flexible working is the norm for very many employees.
But despite this, no one seems very happy. Gallop reports worsening employee engagement, and productivity measures have seen no beneficial ‘uptick’ in our newfound freedom from the commute. Surprisingly, Gallop’s 2023 State of The Workplace survey found that the category of worker with the greatest likelihood to quit their job are those who seemingly enjoy the best of both worlds - hybrid workers. It seems organisations have created a new mode of working, at the expense of some organisational glue.

What will the next 12 months bring? Our experts share their suggestions for a positive, prosperous business year
While the business world seems more unpredictable than ever, with global economic worries, communities broken through two wars and the environment under threat from climate change, the year ahead is starting to come into focus. What lies ahead? Some of our experts at London Business School consider what’s to come and how we might make sense of this next chapter in these uncertain times.

Last year was, without a doubt, the year of generative AI. New Large Language Models, such as ChatGPT, and image generation models like MidJourney, took the world by storm. In 2024, we can expect the trend of these models becoming increasingly capable to continue. More importantly, I believe this will be the year when generative AI starts making a profound impact on the way we conduct business.
Catalysed by ever-improving model performance, including the ability of models to utilise external tools, reduced usage costs, and advancements in addressing data security and privacy concerns, we will witness an explosion of applications. A zoo of 'co-pilots' is already in the works. These will be fine-tuned instances of generative AI, tailored to provide support in specific knowledge-based domains of work, ranging from architecture and accounting to medicine, law, and academia. These co-pilots, varying in quality and usefulness, may initially pose challenges in value assessment and adoption decisions, but market forces will soon sort this out.
Furthermore, I expect business processes to begin adapting to better integrate generative AI. This includes everything from customer service centres rewriting service provision protocols to back-office operations, such as contract monitoring being redesigned to reduce or eliminate reliance on human labour. In education, online classrooms will customise teaching experiences for each student based on their performance and prior knowledge. This development of alternative ways of working will arguably enable generative AI to reach its true potential and have an effect as profound as the technology itself.
Moreover, 2024 will likely see a shift in the narrative, from AI as a replacement for human labour to AI as an enabler of human potential. The synergy between human intelligence and AI's capabilities will be crucial in maximising these technologies' benefits for the betterment of humanity.

As global economic growth decelerates to 2.9% while inflation won’t return to 2% until 2025, according to the International Monetary Fund’s latest forecasts, it seems that 2024 will be a challenging year since interest rates are likely to remain ‘restrictive’ at least in the first part of the year that will elevate risks associated with debt. But, that’s not the only source of risk, 2024 is also the biggest year for elections in history. More than half of the world’s population, over 4 billion people, will go to the polls, such as in the US, EU, UK, India, Taiwan, among many others including Africa. The elections could add to geo-economic risk, which refers to economics being affected by geo-politics, since these elections could result in re-alignments of foreign policies that in turn impact economic policies.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB), the global body that monitors systemic risk in international financial markets, has pointed out that nearly half of global assets ($239.3 trillion) are now found in the shadow banking sector, which is broader than but includes private credit. Formally known as the non-bank financial institutions, this sector is less closely regulated than banks, which is why the FSB and major central banks have expressed concerns that shadow banks could pose a systemic risk to the global economy.
A case in point is China, whereby its trust industry, part of shadow banking, has experienced contagion from the property sector’s woes. The trust industry, worth about $3 trillion in a narrow definition, has recently seen two major trusts fail to make payments they owe to investors due to their significant exposure to the property market. The property crisis is spilling over from banks to shadow banks, which increases the chances of a systemic crisis in the world’s second largest economy and a major engine of global growth.

From tools to teammates: The evolution of AI collaboration in 2025

If 2024 was the year when Generative AI began reshaping the way we work, 2025 is shaping up to be the year we confront the challenges of integrating these new “colleagues” into our workflows. While the Generative AI revolution, fuelled by increasingly capable models and tailored applications, shows promise in moving beyond experimentation, significant hurdles still impede its integration into the heart of business processes. The challenge now lies not just in building AI tools, but in transforming business processes and culture to integrate these tools as functional and reliable team members.
This evolution is catalysed by the emergence of autonomous AI agents that operate alongside human employees in a variety of domains. Powered by Generative AI and equipped with decision-making capabilities, these agents actively interact with the world around them; accessing external systems, gathering real-time data and generating actionable insights. Early frameworks, such as Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (introduced in November 2024), which gives Generative AI access to a PC connected to the internet, illustrate how AI agents can actively perform tasks that previously required human intervention.
Far from being just tools, these agents are better thought of as collaborators: analysing, suggesting and executing tasks with minimal oversight. In customer service, agentic AI systems anticipate client needs and autonomously resolve queries. For example, Sonos, a leading provider of smart sound systems, employs a chatbot that acts as an autonomous problem-solver. This agent independently reads product manuals, proposes novel solutions to customer problems and collaborates with representatives by providing actionable insights that enhance problem resolution.
In legal work, JPMorgan Chase’s COIN platform (Contract Intelligence) autonomously reviews legal documents. This agent performs tasks such as interpreting commercial loan agreements, which would traditionally consume hundreds of hours of lawyer time, in seconds.
Similarly, in back-office operations, companies such as Siemens leverage AI-driven agents to streamline data management.

Studying online is a more affordable route into higher education for many. QMU has online master’s degrees, postgraduate diplomas (PGDip), and postgraduate certificates (PGCert) that are open to students from across the United Kingdom and beyond - enabling you to partake in postgraduate study with us without needing to relocate.
Our flexible online degrees are taught part-time, so you can build on knowledge acquired during your bachelor’s degree whilst continuing to work full-time and earn an income.
Online degrees are ideal for international students, too. You can boost your CV with a qualification from a reputable UK university without the costs associated with moving to a new country. Check the individual course pages for information on entry and IELTS requirements.
How do online and on-campus degree programmes vary in cost?
The cost of online and on-campus postgraduate courses at QMU don’t vary much, as the quality of teaching and knowledge exchange all students experience is of the utmost quality no matter how you study with us.
The difference in cost for studying online or on-campus largely comes from the price and lifestyle of the student experience. On-campus students will likely pay any associated costs of travelling to an open day before enrolling, and may have relocation costs if they don’t live near the university. On-campus students also have the cost of living to consider, plus any social events they want to attend at the students’ union during their time with us.
The experience of the academic year is different for online study students. While you will have the cost of living to take into account, studying part-time from home means your current incomings and outgoings will likely be around the same as pre-registration, tuition fees aside.
Can I pay my tuition fees in instalments?
Yes you can. Fees for our online master’s degrees can be paid in a maximum of six instalments of £2,174 spread across a two-year period.
Is Student finance available?
Yes it is. Higher education loans may be an option for students in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the USA. For further information on the application process and requirements in each country, visit our postgraduate loans page.
Are scholarships and grants available?
Yes. There are a range of options for financial assistance with QMU:
-
The Young International Arbitration Group (YIAG) bursary is a 10% fee reduction for students who are studying our International Dispute Resolution LLM and are a member of the group
-
Earn rewards with our refer a friend scheme

Can my employer fund my studies?
Employer sponsorship depends on your organisation’s individual policy. Many workplaces want to know what you’ll learn and how it applies to your current role. Employers may also want to rule out the possibility of less expensive short courses before committing to master’s degree funding.
Certain subject areas, such as social sciences subjects, business management or healthcare management, may be more likely to gain employer funding to build on knowledge obtained during your BSc or BA (Hons) for internal career progression.
Different businesses may also have different policies based on funding for postgraduate research courses or postgraduate taught courses.
Ask your manager about your company’s policy of sponsoring further study.
Tips for managing your budget as a student
Before your degree start date, make sure you have a clear idea of how much money you have coming in and how much is going out over the duration of your degree. While this may change due to certain circumstances, it’s good to have a starting point and an understanding of how much disposable income you have.

Affordable online degrees with Queen Margaret University
Studying online is a more affordable route into higher education for many. QMU has online master’s degrees, postgraduate diplomas (PGDip), and postgraduate certificates (PGCert) that are open to students from across the United Kingdom and beyond - enabling you to partake in postgraduate study with us without needing to relocate.
Our flexible online degrees are taught part-time, so you can build on knowledge acquired during your bachelor’s degree whilst continuing to work full-time and earn an income.
Online degrees are ideal for international students, too. You can boost your CV with a qualification from a reputable UK university without the costs associated with moving to a new country. Check the individual course pages for information on entry and IELTS requirements.
How do online and on-campus degree programmes vary in cost?
The cost of online and on-campus postgraduate courses at QMU don’t vary much, as the quality of teaching and knowledge exchange all students experience is of the utmost quality no matter how you study with us.
The difference in cost for studying online or on-campus largely comes from the price and lifestyle of the student experience. On-campus students will likely pay any associated costs of travelling to an open day before enrolling, and may have relocation costs if they don’t live near the university. On-campus students also have the cost of living to consider, plus any social events they want to attend at the students’ union during their time with us.
The experience of the academic year is different for online study students. While you will have the cost of living to take into account, studying part-time from home means your current incomings and outgoings will likely be around the same as pre-registration, tuition fees aside.
Can I pay my tuition fees in instalments?
Yes you can. Fees for our online master’s degrees can be paid in a maximum of six instalments of £2,174 spread across a two-year period.
Is Student finance available?
Yes it is. Higher education loans may be an option for students in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the USA. For further information on the application process and requirements in each country, visit our postgraduate loans page.
Are scholarships and grants available?
Yes. There are a range of options for financial assistance with QMU:
-
The Young International Arbitration Group (YIAG) bursary is a 10% fee reduction for students who are studying our International Dispute Resolution LLM and are a member of the group
-
Earn rewards with our refer a friend scheme
-

The challenge
The world is currently undergoing a period of rapid technological transformation, one that is reshaping both our present and our future. In this era, artists and designers hold a crucial role in offering urgent, equitable and alternative perspectives that are often less visible within the commercially-driven development of technology. RCA x Snap Augmented UnRealities focuses on amplifying the creative potential of these perspectives, uniting a diverse cohort of postgraduate student-researchers from the RCA to collaboratively interrogate and shape the role of augmented reality (AR).
The approach
Led by RCA faculty Jack Hardiker-Bresson (Office of Everyone) and Tom Simmons with Snap’s global education, AR, Spectacles, Camera Kit and Lens Studio teams, students work with leading artists and researchers to address accessibility, ecology, ethics, spatial practice, critical theory, artificial intelligence, performance, health, education, materiality, and community engagement. This interdisciplinary dialogue equips students with knowledge and skills for crafting innovative, thoughtful and socially responsible contributions to the field of AR. Working with Snap’s cutting-edge software and wearable AR technology, Spectacles, RCA students produce AR experiences that envision and prototype meaningful and sustainable futures for augmented reality.
Outputs
The impact of the RCA x Snap Augmented UnRealities programme can be observed across the UK and internationally. Students, alumni and faculty actively engage with global AR communities, speaking at conferences and panels, launching start-ups, winning competitions, curating events and mentoring over 200 emerging artists. Their work has been presented at prestigious venues such as the Saatchi Gallery, Outernet, Frameless, and the Breeze Film Festival.
In an age marked by profound technological and societal change, the RCA x Snap Augmented UnRealities programme fosters a dynamic and reciprocal feedback loop between technology developers, artists, designers and the public. This interaction serves as a critical platform for imagining the future of AR, showing how its development can be thoughtful, equitable and accountable to all.

Projects
Tiny Forest: Grow Virtual Trees and See Real-World Impact
HanJu Seo, Liqian Yin
Tiny Forest uses augmented reality to help users understand the impact of growing trees. Through Snapchat’s Lens Studio, users can plant and nurture AR trees on a physical square board, choosing soil types and tree species. The experience visualises the tree’s growth, stored carbon, and health, making the benefits of sustainable actions more tangible. By scanning locations like bus stops, users see how local carbon emissions change as they make greener choices, turning abstract concepts into clear, engaging visuals.
Snap Nap
Boluwatife Kolawole, María Camila de Paul, Jiyeong Kim
SnapNap is designed to guide users through meditation techniques rooted in the ancient Chinese tradition of pressure point stimulation. Unlike conventional meditation apps, it utilises augmented reality to create an immersive experience that engages both the mind and body.
Through the lens of their smart-phone camera, users interact with the app by locating specific pressure points on their body, which are recognised by the screen. As users identify and activate these pressure points, the app provides instructions for stimulation and relaxation.
Minimal visuals are employed to maintain focus on the user’s physical experience, while the emphasis lies on the auditory element, with carefully crafted soundscapes tailored to induce a state of deep relaxation.
Nature’s Pollinators
Aarti Bhalekar, Ayushi Saxena, Riya Mahajan, Ruby Bell
Nature’s Pollinators is an augmented reality card game, designed to educate children about the essential role of pollination in our ecosystem. Discover different pollinators and match them to their favourite flowers, made visible through the interaction between the physical and the digital.
London Haunts
Erjie Chen, Sanya Salehi, Selin Öztürk, Zoe Shum
London Haunts is an interactive experience that brings the eerie history of London’s haunted places to life through augmented reality. Our project, “Haunted London Augmented Reality Map,” invites users to explore the city’s most mysterious and haunted locations, offering an engaging way to learn about the rich history and chilling tales that define these iconic spots.
The user is encouraged to move their phone over a physical map, as though they were guiding a planchette over an Ouija board, to ‘reveal’ haunted narratives in a novel and immersive experience.
Formations
Anushka Khemka, Jane Lee, Meara Withe, Thomas Bugg
Rocks are often perceived as inanimate and unchanging, but are in fact repositories of time, carrying within them countless stories from the past. Formations is a hauntological Augmented Reality experience that brings these silent narratives to the forefront, using soundscapes to highlight the continuity that rocks embody.
Using samples from the Internet Archive and decayed through audio programming, the sounds echo the metamorphosis of rocks and the concept of temporal displacement, evoking the ancient while creating an impression on the present. Each soundscape differs depending on the rock’s type, triggered through arbitrary encounters.
By engaging with rocks through sound, the audience is invited to consider how rocks leave marks on the environment, participating in a sonic meditation on time, presence, and the interconnectedness of all things. With the use of Snap ML highlight forgotten histories and traces of the past embedded within the rocks, and the moments in time that they carry.
Sensory Misalignment
Chanwoo Lee, Chun Guo, Yuebin Zhang, Jake Buckley
Sensory Misalignment is a research and interactive experience questioning reality through human senses. To truly experience the world, we may need to break away from our automatic perception, which creates repetition and sensory dullness. Our project aims to disrupt the automatic and unconscious recognition processes by creating sensory mismatches that challenge users’ expectations.
Transient Journeys are Moments of Flux
Khalil Ismail, Yule Wang, Yuri Cho
Transient Journeys are Moments of Flux is an ambient AR experience designed for audiences to find hidden third spaces around London during liminal bus commutes.
The experience uses bus windows as anchor points to create a sense of magic when looking outside. We imagine a scene-scape with flying creatures that represent different typologies of space (e.g. parks, small art galleries, rest spaces). Attention through eye-tracking triggers creatures to fly towards and interact with you, providing information about the spaces centred around the emotional memories of their related communities
From a technical perspective, we use Reddit sub-threads as a dataset for Neuro Linguistic Programming to generate a map of these spaces. Generative AI is also used to create creatures with physical characteristics that reflect the nature of the spaces.

“Our visit to CESI has been incredibly productive and inspiring,” said Kath Griffiths, who headed the UWTSD delegation. “It has laid a strong foundation for future collaborations that will enrich the experiences of both our students and staff. We look forward to building a dynamic partnership focused on impactful international education.”
CESI extended a warm welcome to the UWTSD team, offering guided tours of its state-of-the-art learning environments and showcasing its research capabilities. Ruth Lied and Laurianne Giteau, International Relations Managers at CESI, played key roles in facilitating the dialogue and aligning both institutions’ visions for future cooperation.
Ruth Lied said: “I visited UWTSD Swansea in November 2024 and have fond memories of the warm welcome I received and exciting discussions I had with academic and administrative staff to explore collaboration possibilities. So, it was a real pleasure to host Kath and Hannah at CESI in April, where we were able to dive deeper into the details of student and faculty exchange after having become official institutional partners! We are excited to see these discussions become a reality and work for the benefit of our students, professors, and researchers with the joint goal of contributing to a more innovative, interconnected, and inclusive world.”
The new partnership presents several exciting opportunities for students on both sides:
- CESI students will have the opportunity to study Information Technology and Cyber Security for a semester at UWTSD’s cutting-edge Swansea Waterfront campus.

The future of work: looking at the interplay between an ageing population, rapidly changing technologies, and lifelong learning
The Workforce Shift: Adapting to Ageing, Automation, and AI, was the latest London Business School Think Ahead event which took place on Wednesday 12 February 2025.
Lynda Gratton, Professor of Management Practice in Organisational Behaviour at London Business School; Thomas Gustinis (LBS EMBA 2008), AI entrepreneur and finance expert, and Mary Glowacka, Global Head of Learning and Leadership Development at Rolls Royce, were joined by journalist Stefan Stern to explore how the workforce is evolving under the complex interchange of demographics and advancements in automation and AI.
The panel discussed the future of work, focusing on the interplay between an ageing population, rapidly changing technologies, and the need for lifelong learning. Professor Gratton emphasised the importance of interconnectivity and Generative AI’s potential to level opportunities on a global scale. Mr Gustinis highlighted the rapid advancements in AI, predicting a five to six-year period of human-AI collaboration, followed by AI outperforming humans in many tasks. Mary Glowacka stressed the necessity of lifelong learning and resilience in organisations, observing that for Rolls-Royce the priority was to examine and interrogate the dimensions of future challenges in a very “systemic and holistic way”.
An audience poll, which asked listeners at the beginning of the discussion to identify what skills they were most focused on developing to stay relevant in the workplace – and which included AI collaboration skills, adaptability and learning agility, digital or technical skills, creative problem-solving, and emotional intelligence - revealed a strong focus on AI collaboration skills and adaptability, with emotional intelligence coming in last.
Tom Gustinis and Professor Gratton expressed surprise at the low percentage of responses awarded to emotional intelligence, adding that there is anxiety surrounding AI taking jobs and noting the importance of collaboration with AI to avoid being outperformed. Mary Glowacka emphasised the need for organisations to build resilience and adapt to emerging technologies.
Throughout what proved to be a stimulating, wide-ranging discussion the panel explored how generative AI can be a ""great leveller"" across different demographics and geographies, investigating how to encourage older workers to be lifelong learners and upskill in the face of technological change. They further examined thoughts on providing connectivity and opportunities for a growing young population in developing countries, discussed the role of emotional intelligence and what it means to be human in the context of the future of work and explored how organisations such as Rolls-Royce can build resilience and adaptability to handle internal and external changes.
Professor Gratton discussed the interconnectivity of various forces shaping the world, including technology, demography, and social change, and emphasised the importance of lifelong learning and upskilling.
Discussion on AI and human performance
Tom Gustinis predicted a future where AI will outperform humans in many areas, but once again emphasised the importance of ‘human plus AI collaboration’ in the near term. Professor Gratton shared the example from her son's experience as a radiologist, highlighting the role of AI in imaging but noting the importance of human interpretation and empathy. Mary Glowacka discusses the role of AI in manufacturing and the importance of trust in AI tools.
The panel then discussed the potential for AI to replace certain jobs but also to enhance human performance in various fields.
Lifelong Learning and Adaptability
Mary Glowacka emphasised the importance of lifelong learning and the need for organisations to foster a culture of continuous development. Professor Gratton discussed the role of education in preparing students for the future and the importance of focusing on the process rather than just the outcome. Tom Gustinis shared his experience of returning to AI and the rapid advancements in the field.
The panel discussed and agreed on the need for organisations to adapt to changing technologies and the importance of maintaining a human touch in the workplace.
The role of business schools and AI
An audience question was posed about whether business schools should embrace or guard against the use of AI tools like ChatGPT. Professor Gratton shared her approach to encouraging students to use AI tools while also focusing on the learning process.
Mary Glowacka discussed the challenges of managing AI use within organisations and the importance of ‘capability building’ over mere knowledge acquisition.
The panel discusses the broader implications of AI for education and the need for a balanced approach to integrating technology into learning.
The Future of Work and Human Creativity
Professor Gratton examined ideas associated with creativity and emotional intelligence in the future of work. Tom Gustinis shared his thoughts on the potential for AI to redefine human value and the need for society to determine how AI is used.
The panel then discussed the potential for AI to enhance human capabilities and the importance of maintaining a positive outlook on the future of work. Stefan Stern reflected on the intrinsic human desire to create and the role of work in identity.
Mr Stern said that preparing for and adapting to the significant workplace, societal, and technological shifts is a challenge faced by businesses of all sizes, all over the globe, acknowledging the thoughts and views of the international audience that the discussion had attracted. These issues are so important, said Mr Stern, that they form the six big global challenges that London Business School is exploring as part of its 60th anniversary this year.

The event, attended by more than 600 people in person and virtually, began with opening remarks from Elias Papaioannou, London Business School Professor of Economics and Co-Academic Director of the Wheeler Institute.
Professor Papaioannou went on to introduce Daron Acemoglu. Acemoglu, a Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), is known for his ground-breaking research across a variety of topics in economics and social sciences; from the role of institutions on long-run development to how technological innovation affects economic growth – which was the central topic of the event’s discussion. Professor Acemoglu also has strong ties to London Business School and was awarded an honorary doctorate from the School in 2018 in recognition of his contributions to the field of economics. In addition to his academic work, Acemoglu is an accomplished writer with multiple bestselling books, including Why Nations Fail and The Narrow Corridor.
Overview of Daron’s latest book Power and Progress
Following Professor Papaioannou’s opening remarks, Acemoglu began what would be his first public in-person presentation of his latest book, Power and Progress, now available in the United Kingdom.
The book examines both historical and contemporary evidence to explore the relationship between technological breakthroughs and social and economic progress. While one would assume advancements in technology over history would automatically result in improvements in broader society, it was often not the case. From the European Middle Ages with breakthroughs in agriculture (e.g., windmills for grain production) to the cotton gin in southern United States during the pre-Civil War era to modern times with the proliferation of digital technologies, the value generated from technological breakthroughs did not often go to average citizenry but to a small number of ruling elites.
According to Acemoglu and Johnson, the absence of new tasks created by technologies designed solely to automate human work will not result in increased labour productivity; rather it will simply dislocate the human workforce and redirect value from labour to capital. On the other hand, technologies that not only enhance efficiency but also generate new tasks for human workers have a dual advantage of increasing marginal productivity and yielding more positive effects on society as a whole.
To illustrate this point, Acemoglu gave the example of Ford Motor Company’s mechanisation of the automotive factory which at the same time as automating work created new tasks for its workers. These technologies, he said, focused not on replacing humans with “machine intelligence” but enabling them with technologies that had the characteristics of “machine usefulness.”
As breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models thrust the world into the era of AI, more should be done to ensure a bright future where these technologies do not serve to further displace labour but instead enable a more productive workforce.
To accomplish this, Acemoglu and Johnson suggest three things must happen:
- Change the narrative: A change in the global narrative on these technologies is needed; a narrative that moves from the blind techno-optimism fixated on replacing humans with machines to one framed around empowering and enabling humans to be more productive.
- Create countervailing powers: Given the growing control of a few private sector corporations over technologies like AI, the presence of countervailing powers, such as regulatory institutions and trade unions, may be needed to ensure that citizens’ and workers’ voices are heard and interests taken into account.
- Redirect technological change to enhance human capabilities: New technologies, particularly AI, should not focus solely on automating tasks previously done by humans and instead seek to empower and enable workforces to be more productive. For AI, this could mean serving to enhance human decision-making by filtering and curating information. While redirecting technological innovation for the benefit of society sounds like a daunting task, Acemoglu cited the success of government subsidies and incentives in driving down the cost of renewable energy, as a recent example.
Discussion with Professor Andrew Scott
Following those conclusions, Acemoglu joined London Business School professor and former colleague Andrew Scott for further discussion on topics covered in the book.
The risk of bling techno-optimism and the leap from technological progress to economic and social progress
The discussion began with a question about the relationship between technological progress and economic and social advancements. Acemoglu argued that the former does not always result in the latter. Often, the term ‘progress’ is misleading, considering the large gap that exists between technological advancements and true societal growth. Technological progress is neither a prerequisite nor a guaranteed path to social progress.
Responding to the question of whether we live in an unusually techno-optimistic era, Acemoglu spoke about how those in charge of technology deployment, and how they often frame their actions in the context of the “common good”. There seems to be a consensus that the “right” use of technology will lead to progress. However, this perspective is subject to interpretation and, more often than not, it aligns with those who stand to benefit most from the technology (e.g., the management who saves on labour costs due to automation).
That is not to discount the value that technologists provide to society. Acemoglu acknowledged the undeniable appeal of our current technological landscape, citing Silicon Valley as a source of remarkable inspiration. However, he warned that its influence could also be problematic.
“So-so automation’’ and technology’s unfulfilled promise of productivity gains
The discussion then turned to the prevailing assumption that leaders around the world have, which asserts that technology fosters productivity growth. While there is a widespread perception that technology is a driving force of productivity, the reality of stagnant productivity growth suggests otherwise. Acemoglu offered an explanation, suggesting that “so-so automation” — technology that provides marginal improvements from automation but not transformative change — might be contributing to this lackluster growth in marginal productivity. Acemoglu explained that when automation is used excessively, valuable opportunities for learning and creativity that human labor brings are cast aside. As a result, the aggregate productivity of economies might decrease, despite individual companies seeing minor upticks in profitability.
He further clarified this by comparing the advent of self-checkout kiosks in grocery stores to the Ford Motor Company’s revolutionary approach to mechanisation. While self-checkout kiosks might offer some convenience, they are unlikely to drive a productivity boom. Conversely, Ford introduced better machinery and radically transformed work processes, leading to significant productivity enhancements.
ChatGPT and automation versus augmentation
The conversation shifted to a discussion on automation versus augmentation – enabling workers to perform more tasks and engage in higher value-added activities. The current technological approach, Acemoglu argues, tends to focus too much on increasing average productivity through automation at the expense of marginal productivity. For the latter, the emphasis should be on augmentation technologies that enhance the capacity of workers to contribute more significantly to the production process. This strategy could potentially increase the marginal product of labor, which refers to the additional output that can be produced by employing one more unit of labor while keeping other inputs constant.
In responding to a question about where OpenAI’s ChatGPT falls on the spectrum from automation to augmentation, Acemoglu distinguished ChatGPT from the broader category of large language models. These models have the potential to filter and provide relevant information in a context-rich environment. He argued that these tools could be highly productive if used to create new tasks and enhance human productivity.
One potential application he says would be providing better information to human decision-makers. Given the significant growth in knowledge work, accessing reliable information has become increasingly important.
However, Acemoglu voiced concerns over the existing architecture and objective of ChatGPT, which was developed and deployed quickly by OpenAI. He argued that the model’s design was not particularly suited to facilitating reliable information access for human cognition and decision-making. It does not provide clarity on its reasoning, neither does it verify the reliability of the information it shares. This authoritative “take it or leave it” approach could be detrimental to human cognition, he argued.
The driving forces behind the dominant vision of “machine intelligence”
Recent developments in artificial intelligence are dominated by a view that humans can and should be replaced by “machine intelligence”, rather than enabled by technologies with “machine usefulness” that can be used alongside humans to increase their productivity.
Next in the discussion, the reasons behind this dominating perspective on technology were explored and examined. Acemoglu shared that in his view this vision is the result of two factors. Firstly, he pointed to the “catchiness” of a compelling vision, as seen with Alan Turing’s conceptualisation of computers as autonomous, intelligent machines. This vision, he says, is not only influential but also changes our perception of ourselves, leading us to view humans as being similar to computing machines and therefore replaceable.
Secondly, he emphasised the power of persuasion. Those with charismatic personalities, compelling narratives, and track records of success have a significant influence over the dominant narratives in tech. Elon Musk is one such example – an individual whose past success and looming public persona have given him a disproportionate influence on technological narratives.
In the context of this dominating vision and its implications for technologies like large language models replacing labour, the discussion turned to the potential of social movements and trade unions to play a larger role in the future. Acemoglu cited several recent successful examples of trade unions, such as the recent strikes from the Writers Guild of America. He added, however, that future labour movements in a world with the widespread use of automation technology will face an uphill battle in ensuring basic rights for their workers. The prevailing “vision oligarchy”, which has a firm grip on the public imagination, will pose a significant challenge.
The evolution of business education
Finally, Acemoglu was asked about the impact of business school education, especially MBA programmes, on CEOs’ decision-making and the overall business landscape. The question stemmed from research findings indicating that CEOs who received their MBAs in the 1980s and ‘90’s tend to cut costs more, not necessarily raise productivity and skew revenue towards capital at the expense of workers. While this is true historically, Acemoglu shared that business school education is starting to evolve, largely due to pressure from younger generations. These emerging leaders, he says, are more interested in comprehensive, future-oriented perspectives that address pressing issues like climate change and inequality, rather than focusing solely on generating shareholder value.
While equipping future leaders with the skills and knowledge to grapple with these challenges is necessary, Acemoglu insisted that simply changing business schools’ curricula to include more ethics and stakeholder considerations is not sufficient. Institutional incentives and dominant tech industry visions need to evolve as well. Without these broader shifts, he says, teachings on ethics and worker treatment may not be enough as the market and technological trends continue to encourage automation.

- Redirect technological change to enhance human capabilities: New technologies, particularly AI, should not focus solely on automating tasks previously done by humans and instead seek to empower and enable workforces to be more productive. For AI, this could mean serving to enhance human decision-making by filtering and curating information. While redirecting technological innovation for the benefit of society sounds like a daunting task, Acemoglu cited the success of government subsidies and incentives in driving down the cost of renewable energy, as a recent example.
Discussion with Professor Andrew Scott
Following those conclusions, Acemoglu joined London Business School professor and former colleague Andrew Scott for further discussion on topics covered in the book.
The risk of bling techno-optimism and the leap from technological progress to economic and social progress
The discussion began with a question about the relationship between technological progress and economic and social advancements. Acemoglu argued that the former does not always result in the latter. Often, the term ‘progress’ is misleading, considering the large gap that exists between technological advancements and true societal growth. Technological progress is neither a prerequisite nor a guaranteed path to social progress.
Responding to the question of whether we live in an unusually techno-optimistic era, Acemoglu spoke about how those in charge of technology deployment, and how they often frame their actions in the context of the “common good”. There seems to be a consensus that the “right” use of technology will lead to progress. However, this perspective is subject to interpretation and, more often than not, it aligns with those who stand to benefit most from the technology (e.g., the management who saves on labour costs due to automation).
That is not to discount the value that technologists provide to society. Acemoglu acknowledged the undeniable appeal of our current technological landscape, citing Silicon Valley as a source of remarkable inspiration. However, he warned that its influence could also be problematic.
“So-so automation’’ and technology’s unfulfilled promise of productivity gains
The discussion then turned to the prevailing assumption that leaders around the world have, which asserts that technology fosters productivity growth. While there is a widespread perception that technology is a driving force of productivity, the reality of stagnant productivity growth suggests otherwise. Acemoglu offered an explanation, suggesting that “so-so automation” — technology that provides marginal improvements from automation but not transformative change — might be contributing to this lackluster growth in marginal productivity. Acemoglu explained that when automation is used excessively, valuable opportunities for learning and creativity that human labor brings are cast aside. As a result, the aggregate productivity of economies might decrease, despite individual companies seeing minor upticks in profitability.
He further clarified this by comparing the advent of self-checkout kiosks in grocery stores to the Ford Motor Company’s revolutionary approach to mechanisation. While self-checkout kiosks might offer some convenience, they are unlikely to drive a productivity boom. Conversely, Ford introduced better machinery and radically transformed work processes, leading to significant productivity enhancements.
ChatGPT and automation versus augmentation
The conversation shifted to a discussion on automation versus augmentation – enabling workers to perform more tasks and engage in higher value-added activities. The current technological approach, Acemoglu argues, tends to focus too much on increasing average productivity through automation at the expense of marginal productivity. For the latter, the emphasis should be on augmentation technologies that enhance the capacity of workers to contribute more significantly to the production process. This strategy could potentially increase the marginal product of labor, which refers to the additional output that can be produced by employing one more unit of labor while keeping other inputs constant.
In responding to a question about where OpenAI’s ChatGPT falls on the spectrum from automation to augmentation, Acemoglu distinguished ChatGPT from the broader category of large language models. These models have the potential to filter and provide relevant information in a context-rich environment. He argued that these tools could be highly productive if used to create new tasks and enhance human productivity.
One potential application he says would be providing better information to human decision-makers. Given the significant growth in knowledge work, accessing reliable information has become increasingly important.
However, Acemoglu voiced concerns over the existing architecture and objective of ChatGPT, which was developed and deployed quickly by OpenAI. He argued that the model’s design was not particularly suited to facilitating reliable information access for human cognition and decision-making. It does not provide clarity on its reasoning, neither does it verify the reliability of the information it shares. This authoritative “take it or leave it” approach could be detrimental to human cognition, he argued.
The driving forces behind the dominant vision of “machine intelligence”
Recent developments in artificial intelligence are dominated by a view that humans can and should be replaced by “machine intelligence”, rather than enabled by technologies with “machine usefulness” that can be used alongside humans to increase their productivity.
Next in the discussion, the reasons behind this dominating perspective on technology were explored and examined. Acemoglu shared that in his view this vision is the result of two factors. Firstly, he pointed to the “catchiness” of a compelling vision, as seen with Alan Turing’s conceptualisation of computers as autonomous, intelligent machines. This vision, he says, is not only influential but also changes our perception of ourselves, leading us to view humans as being similar to computing machines and therefore replaceable.
Secondly, he emphasised the power of persuasion. Those with charismatic personalities, compelling narratives, and track records of success have a significant influence over the dominant narratives in tech. Elon Musk is one such example – an individual whose past success and looming public persona have given him a disproportionate influence on technological narratives.
In the context of this dominating vision and its implications for technologies like large language models replacing labour, the discussion turned to the potential of social movements and trade unions to play a larger role in the future. Acemoglu cited several recent successful examples of trade unions, such as the recent strikes from the Writers Guild of America. He added, however, that future labour movements in a world with the widespread use of automation technology will face an uphill battle in ensuring basic rights for their workers. The prevailing “vision oligarchy”, which has a firm grip on the public imagination, will pose a significant challenge.
The evolution of business education
Finally, Acemoglu was asked about the impact of business school education, especially MBA programmes, on CEOs’ decision-making and the overall business landscape. The question stemmed from research findings indicating that CEOs who received their MBAs in the 1980s and ‘90’s tend to cut costs more, not necessarily raise productivity and skew revenue towards capital at the expense of workers. While this is true historically, Acemoglu shared that business school education is starting to evolve, largely due to pressure from younger generations. These emerging leaders, he says, are more interested in comprehensive, future-oriented perspectives that address pressing issues like climate change and inequality, rather than focusing solely on generating shareholder value.
While equipping future leaders with the skills and knowledge to grapple with these challenges is necessary, Acemoglu insisted that simply changing business schools’ curricula to include more ethics and stakeholder considerations is not sufficient. Institutional incentives and dominant tech industry visions need to evolve as well. Without these broader shifts, he says, teachings on ethics and worker treatment may not be enough as the market and technological trends continue to encourage automation.

An AI-based system to accelerate productivity in the Creative Industries
Charismatic is a powerful technology ecosystem that helps new and existing writers and producers generate and improve scripts, storylines and characters with ease. With its visualisation tool, users can bring their ideas to life and create stories that captivate their audiences.
Project details
Charismatic is a research and development project supported by Innovate UK.
The UK-based consortium includes Oxford based AI company Charisma working with Falmouth University’s Sound/Image Cinema Lab, University of the Arts London’s Creative Computing Institute, Channel Four, Aardman Animations, Sound Reactions, and digital sociologist Lisa Talia Moretti.
A keystone of our research is working with screen partners to discover the potential of emergent technologies to aid and advance creative practice. A central theme of this project is the use of these technologies in assisting creatives in developing their work for the screen, and providing tools with which we can enable underrepresented groups through lowering the barriers to film and television production.
In terms of the potential for research and knowledge exchange, we’re interested in exploring and reporting on the changes to cultures of production that surround these technologies.

In terms of the potential for research and knowledge exchange, we’re interested in exploring and reporting on the changes to cultures of production that surround these technologies.
There are three key objectives of this project:
Broaden Access
Accelerate, improve and strengthen storytelling skills within underprivileged and disadvantaged communities
Bridge AI to the Creative Industries
Increase value within the creative industries with new creators and revenue streams
Create New Story Forms Across Multiple Media
Inspire a new mindset for storytelling that explores narrative design, characters and audience participation
The process to deliver the outcomes of this project will follow a research pathway agreed between UAL and Falmouth University. A key step is the provision of workshops that will engage new content creators from diverse backgrounds to provide a broad frame of reference, and continually test the project’s assumptions.
UAL and Falmouth have international reputations for creative technology and storytelling through the Creative Computing Institute and School of Film and Television’s Sound/Image Cinema Lab respectively. These two universities are working with Charismatic and our partners to research how to apply artificial intelligence to the story-writing and production processes.
Details around the practical research approach, and its technical application to the technology platform being worked on by Charismatic, are detailed below:
The research will be split into three streams: 1) Computational creativity focusing on prompting generative AI systems to generate compelling characters and story scripts; 2) The leveraging of existing intellectual property as inspiration and data sets to optimise these generative AI systems to improve the quality of the creative output; 3) New ways to describe story genres and tropes to accurately prompt generative AI systems, 4) Systems to generate audiovisual and experiential versions of the output scripts, and; 5) Optimal methods to transfer academic results from research organizations to industry and creative practitioners.
The research is cogent to the values of Falmouth University as an institution dedicated to values of inclusion, diversity and equality, and directly addresses the need for inclusive and diverse talent development in the UK film industry. Falmouth’s own film production and existing partnerships with production companies and the regional screen agency have positioned Cornwall as a centre of creative film and television production. The independent screen and commercial production sectors are thriving and fast moving, aided by recent changes to the UK tax relief for studios and indie films. The Charismatic R&D project serves as a flagship and marker of innovation for ongoing creative activity and partnerships with the Sound/Image Cinema Lab, and its place within the Falmouth University’s School of Film & Television and presents a great deal of potential to further reflect this in international research and knowledge exchange.
This project leverages emergent technologies to improve the efficiency and productivity within the creative industries, leading to increased AI adoption and diffusion within these industries. This will reduce cost barriers, skills gaps and ROI uncertainty for creators, and the project is situated within an ethical framework to encourage diverse audiences.
Our primary end user is the creator who is creating entertainment content. This could be both a new entrant to the creative industries who does not have access to funds or industry, and established creators seeking to enhance productivity and lower costs in the pre-production and previsualisation phase of their work.
Principal Investigator Dr Kingsley Marshall is the Head of the School of Film & Television at Falmouth, and the practice research lead within the Pedagogy Futures research centre, responsible for the dissemination of practice and traditional research outputs for screen media. This project aligns with both the Blended Realities and Pedagogy Futures research centres at Falmouth University.
The teaching, learning, research & innovation in Falmouth University’s School of Film & Television (SoFT) is orientated around contemporary film and television practices combined with a critical understanding of the history, present and future of screen-based media. Reflecting a fast moving sector, this is made relevant in terms of our partners and adaptability to guidance from these partners and accrediting bodies (including ScreenSkills, CILECT, NAHEMI, Albert, ARRI, and AVID), inclusive in terms of the teaching content and delivery, the people involved in front of and behind the camera, as well as the diverse and inclusive stories created and considered by these students, staff and our partners, and connected to the world in terms of relationships made manifest through our research, our curriculum, visiting speakers, placements, opportunity for study visits and through the wider schools with national and global partners.
Within the school, the Sound/Image Cinema Lab has a great deal of experience in framing professional screen making environment governed by the contexts of industrial practice within
a safe space for questions and questioning established modes practice – where social competence, self-compassion, empathy and understanding of others, and resilience is valued – and where assessment champions critical examination and reflection, and an attitude of failing forward by learning through doing.
We are driven to support diverse learners whose stories and scholarship are ambitious, and who aim to lead in roles that reflect or inspire social impact, following the principles of the 5As created by the TV Access Project as guidelines for inclusion in UK television production – Anticipate, Ask, Assess, Adjust, Advocate. We champion craft and scholarship that explores and engages with the world outside of the university and articulate new voices that are drivers for positive change. The ‘real world’ of creative practice that awaits our students is often focused on work with a socio-political consideration, with staff and students reflecting upon and presenting a critique of the global, colonial, exclusive, and often existential crises of our time, and our students have a history of challenging this, empowered by a curriculum that allowsthem to explore distinct and diverse voices.
Work from our students has directly represented or inferred the impact of climate change, COVID-19 and preceding global pandemics, terrorism, asymmetrical warfare and global migration, decolonial ideas, depicting underrepresented groups in front of and behind the camera in addition to considering the many challenges presented by technological and cultural change to democracy and the economics of late-capitalism globally. Common themes within our student’s work and staff practices include representations of the future and past, new and underrepresented voices, and the manner with which the recent pace of technological change has disrupted identity in gender and sexuality, race, mental and physical health, and class.

Impact & recognition
This project targets the creator economy in the UK, and then internationally. The creator economy has been a driving force for job creation in the UK with approximately 25% of the UK population, or 16.5 million people, describing themselves as content creators (source: Adobe, Future of Creativity, 2022). However, most UK creators see creating content as separate to their primary employment, with 65% fully employed in other fields (source: Shopify). This market profile indicates that there is a market desire for creation, but the revenue streams have yet to appear to sustain this desire. Charismatic aims to tap into this passion and gap in the market and generate new revenue streams opportunities accelerated by AI.
The creator economy has transformed dynamics of the entertainment industry by enabling independent creators to reach audiences directly.
The global total addressable creator market is projected to double over the next five years to $480 billion by 2027 from $250 billion today. The number of global creators is expected to grow at a 10-20% CAGR during the same period. (Source: Goldman Sachs).
This has also led to increased investment in the sector, with a record $1.3 billion in funding in 2021 (source: CBInsights) which has fuelled the development of new technologies that enable creators to monetise their content more directly and earn a larger share of the overall revenue.
Wider project KPIs include:
- Knowledge transfer through at least four workshops with Aardman and Channel 4
- New data sets trained ethically and peer-reviewed with a focus on Creative Industries
- Recruitment of underrepresented and diverse creators to the platform
Project media
A new consortium plans to create an Artificial Intelligence prototype and publish new research into how AI could support under-represented content creators and established producers to enhance storytelling in film and television.
The Charismatic consortium - which has received £1.04million from the government’s Innovate UK programme – will research the opportunities for the creative industries to better leverage the potential of AI technologies. The project will explore how creators could use AI to generate new material such as storyboards, scenes and settings.

- Presentations: Presentations describing the research findings and impact on the creative industries. In addition to the AI Ethics work, a series of presentations will be generated for broader academic, industry and public consumption
Impact & recognition
This project targets the creator economy in the UK, and then internationally. The creator economy has been a driving force for job creation in the UK with approximately 25% of the UK population, or 16.5 million people, describing themselves as content creators (source: Adobe, Future of Creativity, 2022). However, most UK creators see creating content as separate to their primary employment, with 65% fully employed in other fields (source: Shopify). This market profile indicates that there is a market desire for creation, but the revenue streams have yet to appear to sustain this desire. Charismatic aims to tap into this passion and gap in the market and generate new revenue streams opportunities accelerated by AI.
The creator economy has transformed dynamics of the entertainment industry by enabling independent creators to reach audiences directly.
The global total addressable creator market is projected to double over the next five years to $480 billion by 2027 from $250 billion today. The number of global creators is expected to grow at a 10-20% CAGR during the same period. (Source: Goldman Sachs).
This has also led to increased investment in the sector, with a record $1.3 billion in funding in 2021 (source: CBInsights) which has fuelled the development of new technologies that enable creators to monetise their content more directly and earn a larger share of the overall revenue.
Wider project KPIs include:
- Knowledge transfer through at least four workshops with Aardman and Channel 4
- New data sets trained ethically and peer-reviewed with a focus on Creative Industries
- Recruitment of underrepresented and diverse creators to the platform
Project media
A new consortium plans to create an Artificial Intelligence prototype and publish new research into how AI could support under-represented content creators and established producers to enhance storytelling in film and television.
The Charismatic consortium - which has received £1.04million from the government’s Innovate UK programme – will research the opportunities for the creative industries to better leverage the potential of AI technologies. The project will explore how creators could use AI to generate new material such as storyboards, scenes and settings.

Radha Basu (Founder and CEO of iMerit and co-founder of Anudip Foundation) shared her journey as a pioneer in the Indian software industry and a tech entrepreneur dedicated to addressing youth unemployment.
Through iMerit and Anudip, Radha has employed and upskilled hundreds of marginalised women and youth in digital services. Before her work with these foundations, she led SupportSoft (now ) as Chairman & CEO and spent two decades at Hewlett Packard, where she founded HP’s India operations. Radha has also served on the boards of NetHope, Jhumki Basu Foundation, and Santa Clara CSTS.
The conversation was moderated by Rajesh Chandy (Professor of Marketing and the Tony and Maureen Wheeler Chair in Entrepreneurship at London Business School, and Co-Academic Director of the Wheeler Institute).
iMerit’s Mission and Inclusivity
The discussion started off with Radha providing an overview of iMerit’s mission. As an AI technology company, it focuses on AI solutions and products. iMerit specialises in data annotation and labelling to train AI models for clients. These models, essential for AI development, rely on annotated data to function effectively. iMerit’s projects include autonomous technologies, medical AI for surgical robots, and social media analytics for issues like suicide prevention. The company handles edge cases, simulations, and test scenarios to ensure model reliability. Radha highlighted iMerit’s competitive edge, partially stemming from its focus on client success and business growth. This focus was reflected in the company’s high net revenue retention, implying strong client relationships.
Another important achievement mentioned by Radha was the 50-50 gender split among the employees at iMerit which includes young people from low-income and underrepresented communities, extending opportunities beyond established tech hubs. The company operates in areas like Shillong, Bhuvaneshwar, and Calcutta, focusing on critical job creation regions.
Engaging with the Next Generation of Employees
Radha described her collaborative and approachable communication style with younger employees at iMerit, where the average age is 24.6 years. Despite being the CEO and founder, Radha is affectionately called “Dee,” meaning older sister. Young employees are confident and often challenge her decisions. For instance, they might recall a time when Radha doubted a complex project, only to see it succeed later. This dynamic keeps her energised and fulfilled, as the employees’ persistence and enthusiasm drive the company’s success.
Radha’s Personal Journey
Moving on to Radha’s personal journey, she talked about her decision to pursue engineering the strict traditional environment. She recounted a clear gender imbalance during her university years, being one of only 17 girls among 2,700 boys in her engineering university.
Joining HP’s R&D lab marked the beginning of her successful career. Radha credited HP for honing her business skills, understanding financials, and blending technology with community impact. During her years at HP, Radha had a transformative moment that connected her past experiences to her current work. She described how these experiences shaped her approach to technology, entrepreneurship, and impact. Radha’s journey illustrates the blend of perseverance, learning, and seizing opportunities, ultimately leading her to create meaningful social impact through iMerit.
From HP to and Beyond
After 20 years at HP, Radha joined in 2000 as a CEO, just before the dot-com bust. Despite the timing, the company thrived, and she gained valuable experience. This led her to establish a non-profit called Anudip Foundation focused on training young people from marginalised backgrounds. Over 15 years, the organisation upskilled over 500,000 people, with 75% securing jobs and over 50% being women.
Radha’s vision extended to digital skills and AI. She initiated training in computer vision and AI, targeting large clients and skilling individuals in advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles and 3D mapping. Her focus on high standards and selective investors ensured the company’s growth and success. One of iMerit’s centres became a global hub of excellence in computer vision, celebrating a decade of impactful work.
Aligning Social Impact with Profitability
The importance of aligning social impact with business goals was discussed as well. Indeed, Radha maintained that companies seek solutions, high-quality technology, and profitability. While they may appreciate noble causes, their primary concern is business success. To maintain competitiveness, expertise, technology, and adaptability are crucial, especially with the rapid evolution of AI.
The establishment of iMerit’s training academy became a business differentiator, reducing retraining costs and fostering a consistent, skilled workforce. Radha reiterated the importance of believing in young people’s potential, taking risks, and embracing change. Rajesh acknowledged how Radha’s experiences at HP and the emergence of Bangalore as a tech centre influenced her. He noted that such transformations could happen in other cities, highlighting the potential for new tech hubs to emerge globally.
Regulation of AI
When asked about the dialogue between the business community and policymakers regarding AI regulation, Radha underscored the importance of responsible AI. She noted that AI models are trained by examples, making it essential to consider who provides these examples and how they shape AI.
Radha advocated for a collaborative approach to regulation, involving AI experts from technology and enterprise sectors working with government officials. While monitoring and security are important, she argued that regulations should not stifle innovation. There’s an ongoing debate about pausing AI development until proper regulations are in place. However, it was pointed out that young innovators are unlikely to wait for older generations to catch up. They will continue to develop and push boundaries, which is essential for progress.
Adapting to Generative AI: Workforce Challenges and Solutions
IMerit has come a long way, adapting to the challenges posed by the rise of generative AI and automation. Radha explained that while iMerit initially focused on annotation and labelling, achieving high-quality results through extensive training and skilling academies, generative AI has introduced new complexities requiring different skills.
According to Radha, comprehension, communication, and confidence, are essential for prompt engineering and response, where employees must interact effectively with AI models. To tackle this, iMerit prioritises training in logical reasoning, judgment, and critical thinking, alongside advanced English skills. iMerit invested in retraining programs, allowing employees to take some time off from projects to build their skills and prepare better for future challenges.
Innovative Solutions Amid the COVID-19 Crisis
When the COVID-19 pandemic started, iMerit faced a true existential crisis, as it was forced to close its centres overnight. Yet those centres were not only workplaces but also social hubs for employees. With 300 employees suddenly at home, many in remote areas without broadband, maintaining operations seemed daunting.
Demonstrating its adaptability, iMerit worked with broadband providers to extend last-mile connectivity to employees’ homes. They initiated “combat coding,” where employees were equipped with the necessary tools and support. Remarkably, employees travelled up to 50 kilometres on motorbikes to deliver and install equipment.
Radha shared inspiring stories of resilience: women carrying desktops home, pregnant employees balancing work and family, and innovative setups like using kitchen spaces or rooftops for better connectivity. One particularly memorable image was of an employee working under an umbrella on her roof to get a better signal. This spirit of innovation and dedication allowed iMerit to continue operations. Within five weeks, they resumed work community by community, project by project. The company’s culture of responsibility and problem-solving was crucial. Employees supported each other, ensuring projects stayed on track.

From tools to teammates: The evolution of AI collaboration in 2025
Nicos Savva, Professor of Management Science and Operations; Chair, Management Science and Operations Faculty
If 2024 was the year when Generative AI began reshaping the way we work, 2025 is shaping up to be the year we confront the challenges of integrating these new “colleagues” into our workflows. While the Generative AI revolution, fuelled by increasingly capable models and tailored applications, shows promise in moving beyond experimentation, significant hurdles still impede its integration into the heart of business processes. The challenge now lies not just in building AI tools, but in transforming business processes and culture to integrate these tools as functional and reliable team members.
This evolution is catalysed by the emergence of autonomous AI agents that operate alongside human employees in a variety of domains. Powered by Generative AI and equipped with decision-making capabilities, these agents actively interact with the world around them; accessing external systems, gathering real-time data and generating actionable insights. Early frameworks, such as Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (introduced in November 2024), which gives Generative AI access to a PC connected to the internet, illustrate how AI agents can actively perform tasks that previously required human intervention.
Far from being just tools, these agents are better thought of as collaborators: analysing, suggesting and executing tasks with minimal oversight. In customer service, agentic AI systems anticipate client needs and autonomously resolve queries. For example, Sonos, a leading provider of smart sound systems, employs a chatbot that acts as an autonomous problem-solver. This agent independently reads product manuals, proposes novel solutions to customer problems and collaborates with representatives by providing actionable insights that enhance problem resolution.
In legal work, JPMorgan Chase’s COIN platform (Contract Intelligence) autonomously reviews legal documents. This agent performs tasks such as interpreting commercial loan agreements, which would traditionally consume hundreds of hours of lawyer time, in seconds.
Similarly, in back-office operations, companies such as Siemens leverage AI-driven agents to streamline data management. These agents “read” data from one system, reformat it and transfer it to another autonomously, eliminating the need for extensive manual intervention.",2333,,London Business School,20.2,,2125,2333,london.edu,,0:00,,,United Kingdom,"media, research materials",4.431870618821105,0.6091954022988506,607,False,2333,"Business trends in 2025 | London Business School

28 October 2024
The journey of belonging was the key for entrepreneur and marketing specialist Simon Vincent. Based in Cornwall, Simon stands at the forefront of marketing innovation with his companies X-CMO and KAIAKO AI.
X-CMO, a fractional head of marketing consultancy for various clients, while KAIAKO utilises the power of generative AI to craft content specifically tailored for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
In an interview with Launchpad Futures, we see Simon’s entrepreneurial journey as a testament to resilience, adaptability, and the relentless pursuit of one’s passions.
Launchpad’s Support in the early beginnings
Simon’s relationship with Launchpad began around two and a half years ago. Initially drawn in as a mentor for startups involved in the ERDF-funded program, then moving to hands-on support offering invaluable advice and insights into marketing strategies. As the program evolved into Launchpad Futures, he collaborated with the LPF team to develop promotional materials for X-CMO and KAIAKO, helping to explain how the tool applies tone of voice and visual identity to brand communications.
Thus far [Launchpad Futures] have funded the creation of eight social media videos and I’ve been working with three university students on short work placements, a videographer, a producer, and an editor to create three videos
The Genesis of X-CMO
After working in London for a few years, Simon transitioned to Cornwall in search of a better work-life balance after becoming a father.
Initially moving to Newbury working at a local agency – he had reached a ceiling when it came to moving up in the company. He started looking at jobs in Cornwall doing similar work but found the pay cut too unsustainable to make the move further south.
So, Simon sought guidance from the Managing Director of his previous agency and the encouragement he received fuelled his confidence to establish X-CMO in 2018, despite the looming uncertainties of entrepreneurship.
…he gave me some real self-belief in my ability to do that. It's a really scary thing to do, particularly when already have a child like I did at the time. The courage it takes to say, ‘I'm going to give up a steady wage and a solid role in somebody else's company and build something of my own.
Simon hasn’t looked back since.
Navigating Challenges
The path of an entrepreneur, however, comes with trials. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic saw Simon lose numerous clients as shops and businesses closed. This challenging period enforced change and adaptation, compelling Simon to rethink the business strategy.
I realised I needed to build something that's much bigger than me, that's more substantial…
This realisation encouraged Simon to explore scaling X-CMO, examining different business models, and looking at alternatives to a typical agency model. It ultimately led to the creation of KAIAKO AI in partnership with Nick du Preez, a CTO with expertise in AI technology. In combination the pair designed a software that could potentially scale up.

The partnership with co-founder Nick has been transformative - with twice the power, getting twice the work done, in half the amount of time. “Now that I've experienced having a co-founder, I don't think I would start a company on my own again,” he admits.
The change in productivity as a result of the synergy is initially alarming but ultimately extremely motivating. Simon highlights the importance of clarity in roles, noting that “delegation is one of the hardest things to do,” but is crucial for effective collaboration.
Once you take a leap of faith, with compromises involved, knowing your skillset and area of expertise – the collaboration is magical.
Looking ahead, Simon has ambitious plans for KAIAKO. With the recent launch of a fully operational website and a fundraising initiative aimed at raising £300,000, he envisions building a robust team and further developing the product.
Long-term, I want KAIAKO to enable a client to create the first 100% AI-generated piece of content to win a Cannes Lion,” he states. “I want that success to come from a small company, as that’s where AI can level the playing field with big budget companies.
Embracing AI in Creativity
‘The vast majority of people can’t explain why a piece of content is great. Quite often I think most people can feel it. As creatives – that’s our job.’
Simon’s perspective on AI is both optimistic and pragmatic. He believes that creativity should embrace AI as a powerful tool rather than a threat. Creatives who can articulate what makes marketing effective will apply these rules to their work and clients. AI is a tool to allow designers and creatives to go above and beyond their current practice.
“AI is only as good as the prompts you give it,” he explains. For him, the skill of a creative lies not just in producing content but in knowing how to leverage technology to enhance their work.
“In many ways, AI should be seen as a facilitator,” he argues. “It allows creatives to focus on refining their ideas and connecting with clients, ultimately leading to a more efficient process.” KAIAKO aims to create a better quality of written copy, which will then hopefully move into image and video, doing a large amount of the heavy lifting, to move away from the daunting blank page.
So where did the drive start?
To build a company requires finding something impossible to switch off and committing to that idea no matter the circumstances.
Reflecting on his journey, Simon acknowledges that his upbringing has played a crucial role in shaping his entrepreneurial outlook. Having lived in South-East Asia and the United States as a child, he spent time adapting to these new cultures and the people he was surrounded by.
“In the end, if you're going to commit your heart and soul to a company, it has to be based on something you love or find fascinating,” he concludes. For Simon, this commitment to understanding human connection and effective communication is at the core of his entrepreneurial success.

The entrepreneurial journey of Simon Vincent: from Marketing Consultant to AI Innovator
28 October 2024
The journey of belonging was the key for entrepreneur and marketing specialist Simon Vincent. Based in Cornwall, Simon stands at the forefront of marketing innovation with his companies X-CMO and KAIAKO AI.
X-CMO, a fractional head of marketing consultancy for various clients, while KAIAKO utilises the power of generative AI to craft content specifically tailored for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
In an interview with Launchpad Futures, we see Simon’s entrepreneurial journey as a testament to resilience, adaptability, and the relentless pursuit of one’s passions.
Launchpad’s Support in the early beginnings
Simon’s relationship with Launchpad began around two and a half years ago. Initially drawn in as a mentor for startups involved in the ERDF-funded program, then moving to hands-on support offering invaluable advice and insights into marketing strategies. As the program evolved into Launchpad Futures, he collaborated with the LPF team to develop promotional materials for X-CMO and KAIAKO, helping to explain how the tool applies tone of voice and visual identity to brand communications.
Thus far [Launchpad Futures] have funded the creation of eight social media videos and I’ve been working with three university students on short work placements, a videographer, a producer, and an editor to create three videos
The Genesis of X-CMO
After working in London for a few years, Simon transitioned to Cornwall in search of a better work-life balance after becoming a father.
Initially moving to Newbury working at a local agency – he had reached a ceiling when it came to moving up in the company. He started looking at jobs in Cornwall doing similar work but found the pay cut too unsustainable to make the move further south.
So, Simon sought guidance from the Managing Director of his previous agency and the encouragement he received fuelled his confidence to establish X-CMO in 2018, despite the looming uncertainties of entrepreneurship.
…he gave me some real self-belief in my ability to do that. It's a really scary thing to do, particularly when already have a child like I did at the time. The courage it takes to say, ‘I'm going to give up a steady wage and a solid role in somebody else's company and build something of my own.
Simon hasn’t looked back since.
Navigating Challenges
The path of an entrepreneur, however, comes with trials. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic saw Simon lose numerous clients as shops and businesses closed. This challenging period enforced change and adaptation, compelling Simon to rethink the business strategy.
I realised I needed to build something that's much bigger than me, that's more substantial…
This realisation encouraged Simon to explore scaling X-CMO, examining different business models, and looking at alternatives to a typical agency model. It ultimately led to the creation of KAIAKO AI in partnership with Nick du Preez, a CTO with expertise in AI technology. In combination the pair designed a software that could potentially scale up.

The partnership with co-founder Nick has been transformative - with twice the power, getting twice the work done, in half the amount of time. “Now that I've experienced having a co-founder, I don't think I would start a company on my own again,” he admits.

Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have experienced rapid development in recent years, spanning from large language models (LLMs) to generative artificial intelligence (GAI). These cutting-edge advancements have significantly impacted various aspects of our daily lives. However, when integrating these technologies into professional domains like aerospace, transport, and manufacturing, careful design and comprehensive testing are imperative to enhance the safety of human users and facilitate efficient collaboration with machines.
Moreover, a crucial consideration is how these AI technologies can adapt to and revolutionise existing ecosystems within high-value and high-demand infrastructures, such as airports, aircraft, and various advanced mobility systems.
Utilising innovative AI technologies and leveraging the platform advantages of Cranfield University, the MSc Applied Artificial Intelligence course aims to cultivate future leaders in applied AI across diverse engineering domains. Its primary objective is to expedite the development and deployment of reliable AI technologies for safety-critical applications worldwide.
The group design project (GDP) is a problem-based learning module, and the aim of the GDP is for students to design, implement, validate and test real-time AI-based systems to solve real-world problems. The GDP also aims to provide students with the experience of working on a collaborative engineering project, satisfying the requirements of a potential customer and respecting deadlines.
In 2022 and 2023, students enrolled on our MSc in Applied Artificial Intelligence were assigned a stimulating and demanding group design project. The objective was to leverage the applied AI knowledge acquired from their coursework to develop innovative and safer airport products. Working in small teams of six individuals, students were tasked with designing solutions encompassing software and hardware architecture, AI model development and testing, as well as real-world engagement aspects.
The project’s topic was intentionally broad, requiring students to collaborate within their groups to explore and refine specific areas of interest based on their collective expertise and interests. This approach fostered creativity, teamwork, and a deeper understanding of the practical application of AI technologies in real-world scenarios.
Each group was asked to develop real-time AI solutions for smart airports to achieve the following functionalities:
- The system shall be capable of detecting human users and estimating their poses and behaviours based on precise pose detection and tracking.
- The system shall be able to classify different crowd behaviours and clarify the reasons, importance, and feasibilities.
- The AI model should be cross-validated with different metrics in accuracy, computing, and inference.
- The AI model should be able to be implemented in real-time to inform the advantages and disadvantages of current AI technologies in these safety-critical applications.
- The system can rely on different sensor sources as input to enable sensor fusion for robust performance, however, very low-cost but efficient solutions are also welcomed.
Case study 1: Fall detection in an aircraft maintenance environment.
Maintenance environments pose significant hazards, including unattended machinery, inadequate fencing or physical guards near dangerous areas, and cluttered workspaces. Among these risks, fatal falling injuries are alarmingly common. Detecting and reporting non-fatal incidents promptly could prevent further harm or fatalities. Therefore, this work proposes an integrated vision-based system to monitor employees during aircraft maintenance activities, enhancing safety and preventing accidents (see the figure below).
From the initial training and validation results of the designed model, the apparent absence of a ready-made airport hangar maintenance dataset presents a possibility of a bias towards images from videos captured from perpendicular camera angles taken from proximity to the subject. Leveraging the Cranfield advantages, the Cranfield University maintenance hangar was chosen and used for the data collection in this project.
In total, about 50 short (two to five minutes) videos of simulated maintenance activities were recorded, some with falls and others without. The captured videos were stripped into frames and annotated using MoveNet pose estimation software library and vector maps of the subject’s key joint positions were generated. The figure below shows some snapshots of the experimental data.
Our students tested the 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D convolutional neural network approaches to quantitatively evaluate the design of the most powerful AI model. The figure below is a demonstration of the 3-D convolution solutions.
Finally, the proposed AI solutions achieved good detection results for the fall behaviour as shown in the figure below. A few conclusions can be drawn. First, the model had 0 FP classifications which suggests the model does not misclassify a fall. Second, there are 940 true negatives for each model, this could likely be due to each test data containing a portion of non-falls (classified as 0) before the actor falls over.
Case study 2: Detection of vital signs of myocardial infarction using computer vision and edge AI
Edge AI refers to the deployment of artificial intelligence applications in devices located across the physical environment. Affordability and ease of use are key factors in the adoption of AI algorithms in situations where end users encounter real-world challenges. In this project, our student proposed a low-cost and lightweight heart attack detection model for rapid response and rescue at the airport. The process is composed of four main stages as shown in the figure below.
The first stage constitutes the appropriate selection and preparation of an image dataset, along with the necessary annotations for the bounding boxes of the classes (chest pain, fall).
Furthermore, as a second stage comes the training of our object detector model via transfer learning. The specific stage was performed in Google Colab, using PyTorch. Subsequently, after the completion of the training stage, the model was inserted in NVIDIA’s Jetson Nano, which was our chosen embedded device to be used for our Edge AI computer vision application.
The third stage of our system’s design was the model’s appropriate conversion and optimisation, for it to run more efficiently on Jetson Nano. Our model’s optimisation was performed using NVIDIA’s TensorRT inference engine and the specific process was executed in Jetson Nano (as shown in the figure below).
The last step is the optimised model’s execution on Jetson Nano, using as inputs the frames that it receives from a web camera, to perform the real-time object detection process and detect our classes (chest pain, fall). Along with this process, in the inference code that runs on Jetson Nano, there were two specific scenarios. The final inference results are shown in the figure below.
Case study 3: Crowd monitoring and social distancing analysis
Airports have huge influxes of passenger flows every single day, and similarly to other crowded locations and organisations, they must ensure public safety and ensure adequate measures are implemented to mitigate risks during pandemics. In this project, our students proposed an integrated computer vision-based system that provides multi-functional crowd monitoring and analysis throughout airports. The system outputs are intended to benefit airport management staff and passengers alike, through providing crowd-based analytics and intelligence.
The system consists of an integrated platform (see the figure below) to analyse and monitor crowds in public locations using video surveillance feeds. The focus is specifically on smart airports, but the basic framework is adaptable to any public context where analysing and monitoring crowd characteristics is useful.
The pose features extracted from a scene are used by system downstream models to perform unique tasks. This includes person counting, interpersonal distance estimation, mask object detection, status classification (sitting, standing, walking, lying etc.), and social clustering. The results are then combined to form the integrated dashboard and monitoring system. With exception to the common use of pose features, these tasks represent unique challenges with different modelling approaches. Fortunately, due to the modular system design, it was possible to abstract each task and have different team members develop them.
Last, an interactable interface is designed to integrate all the downstream outputs into a single viewport (see the figure below). The app uploads data files created by the downstream models to the dashboard in real time so that analysis of the current state of the scene can be made. At any given time, the original footage of the scene can be viewed, along with the pose features extracted from each person on a video player adjacent to it. The decision maker can switch between a boxplot view to a heatmap view, and subsequently change which footage the data is being received from two drop-down menus. Statistics regarding the scene are displayed on the very right of the viewport. These statistics are total person mask status, total risk profile, total persons pose status, total person count, social distancing proportions and proportions boxplot.
Case study 4: Violence detection at the airport
Last, one of our groups aims to develop a violence detection framework that estimates human poses and classifies violent behaviour in surveillance footage (as shown in the figure below). Instead of directly extracting features from video frames, this framework uses ViTPose to detect human poses in each frame, then pre-processes and extracts features from the key points information.
Comprehensive analysis of various models using multiple datasets (angle-based, distance-based, 1-second and 2-seconds of sequences) with a total of 162 hyperparameter combinations, the team finally identified several promising models that meet specific evaluation criteria. One can conclude that models can extract valuable information about violent behaviour using distance features of body key points as shown in the figure below.
Last, by collaborating with Saab UK, our students can develop and integrate their AI models with the industrial-level platform (SAFE), a powerful situation awareness platform widely used in many UK police stations for surveillance. The KAFKA gateway is applied following the AI engine and forwarded to the client terminal for further display and alerts. If there is any violence detected in the intercepted video with bounding boxes, it will trigger the alarm we configured specifically for our model showing the intercepted video in the SAFE client layout, it will give us the alert message with details. In the end, our students successfully deployed the AI model from our DARTeC centre and communicated with the Saab SAFE system for human situation awareness augmentation.

16/09/2024
We have issued a second edition of the APA7 Author-Date referencing guide.
The updated edition contains an enhanced introduction written in association with the academic language support team. It includes guidance on why and when to use in-text citations, what an in-text citation should look like, how to incorporate citations into your writing, and what to do with trickier citations like multiple group authors, abbreviations, and authors with the same names. In terms of the referencing advice itself, there is further information on using web page links and retrieved dates.
In response to your feedback, we have added guidance for additional source types, including:
- reference works like dictionaries, thesaurus, and encyclopaedias
- military reports such as JSPs, JDPs, JCNs and MAA regulatory publications
- personal profiles and psychometric reports
- ICAO standards
- legal documents such as Acts in another language, European regulations, and EASA regulations
- internet sources including frequently updated web pages, Blog posts, Wikis and Knowledge bases
- how to deal with surveys, questionnaires, or interviews from your research
- acknowledging use of Generative AI images and output
The new guide is now available on our referencing and plagiarism web page.
If you need any help or advice with referencing, please contact your library.
Minor changes to existing guidance from the first edition
Please note two very minor changes to the existing guidance.
- There is a correction to the use of italics in referencing a conference. The title should be italicised, not the conference.
So instead of:
Wilson, M. (2019, May 8). (Lack of) diversity at work [Keynote address]. M25 2019 Annual Conference: Diversifying our Services, London, England. 
the reference should actually read:
Wilson, M. (2019, May 8). (Lack of) diversity at work [Keynote address]. M25 2019 Annual Conference: Diversifying our Services, London, England. - In the first edition we used abbreviations for group authors e.g. (MOD, 2021) whereas we are now advising to spell abbreviations out in full the first time you use them e.g. (Ministry of Defence [MOD], 2021).

This event is now over, but you can see work from graduating students via the 2024 student profile site.
Alongside exhibitions showcasing student work, there will be a variety of workshops, readings, performances, screenings, panel talks and lectures from students and alumni which are free and open to the public.
With exhibited works exploring themes including sustainability, AI, identity, innovative technology and inclusivity, RCA2024 will highlight some of the world’s most pressing issues along with the latest art and design innovations.
The School of Arts & Humanities postgraduate exhibitions and events will take place at the RCA Battersea campus from 20 June - 23 June. Highlights of student work include:
Adjani Ossakkèh Okpu–Egbe (MA Contemporary Art Practice), awardee of the RCA’s Sir Frank Bowling Scholarship, presents abstract semi-figurative work which incorporates autobiographical content, unpredictable materials and symbolisms like fish, vine bearing lemons and fantastical beasts he refers to as ‘manimals’.
Tak Hei Tam (MA Jewellery & Metal) is interested in spatial relationships and objects that can change the perception of our surroundings. Gathering facades from the area of Queen's Gate, SW7, and inputting them into generative AI, he has created tangible artefacts from “fake” generated images, resonating the mechanism of generative AI with how we develop a sense of place and memories.
From 12 - 14 July (Part 1), and 19 - 21 July (Part 2), the School of Design postgraduate exhibitions and events will take place at the RCA Battersea campus. Highlights from the exhibition include:
Bo Gyeom Kim’s (MA Design Products) conceptual design work envisions a dystopian future shaped by excessive plastic production and pollution. In ‘Water Purifier’ he resists the plastic coverings of products by revealing the inherent beauty of the underlying materials and mechanisms.
Sustainability and materiality are central to Sofía Barbé’s (MA Textiles) textile practice, crafting joyful creatures from natural fibres like coconut, wool, and mycelium (fungi). Her series of soft sculptures inspired by the concept of Nature Play encourages us to reconnect with nature.
The School of Architecture postgraduate exhibitions and events will take place at the Truman Brewery from 12–14 July. Highlights include:
Sam Joseph’s (MA Interior Design) interior designs create an empowering environment for survivors of domestic abuse, exploring the re-use of a factory as a transitional home, community education centre, and gallery, to advocate for societal change on violence against women.
The Festival of Communication, a series of events and exhibitions from the School of Communication, will take place on selected dates between 17 July and 4 August at RCA White City and the surrounding area, as well as at Outernet London. Highlight projects include:
Polina Ami Kosele (MA Digital Direction) illuminates the mental load carried by mothers-to-be in the context of today's geopolitical, societal, and environmental landscape. Inspired by the notion of pregnancy as a journey, Polina’s visuals leverage an airport x-ray conveyor belt with bags symbolic of the mother's womb, with contents reflecting the concerns of expectant mothers.
Inga Ziemele (MA Visual Communication) known for her bold anthropomorphic vector characters is expanding her practice with 3D and physical object making. Her project materialises and visualises the feelings of anxiety through character illustration and gaming references.

London Business School and the Institute of Directors team up to answer this and other important big questions
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is all the rage, but is it worth the excitement? Are we losing all sense of proportion, as we did two years ago with the grandiose if elusive promises of the metaverse? Or is this the beginning of a wave that will sweep through the economy, leading to new winners and losers? And, what does this mean for companies and policy makers alike?
The problem, Professor Michael G Jacobides argues, is that GenAI’s impact is both over-hyped (in the sense that it is unlikely to boost corporate profits as some consultants like McKinsey suggest), and under-appreciated (as it will radically disrupt some sectors such as advertising and some business models like advisory more than others).
The challenge is that there is little research that looks into the ways in which GenAI will reshape the competitive impact. Advisors and technology vendors are excited to make the case for new products and services spurred by GenAI, and academics cannot yet assess how GenAI is changing the competitive landscape. Yet we urgently need to have an initial map, as businesses cannot afford to sit back and wait for the noise to die down and the air to start to clear, since technology is developing fast.
The upshot is that not only business leaders and politicians, but also academics and consultants will need to dig deeper. They should be looking at their own models and methodologies, examining their products and markets and challenging the assumptions on which those models and methodologies have been based in the past.

""The researchers found that not all sectors expected to be disrupted in the same way or as dramatically""
That is the background to a new policy paper, published by the School and the Institute of Directors (IoD), assessing the expected impact of GenAI on the U.K. competitive landscape. The study was produced by a London Business School team led by Michael and doctoral student Mingyu Dalbert Ma, in cooperation with Faisal Khan, Chair of the IoD’s Expert Advisory Group on Science, Innovation and Technology. It was funded by the U.K Research and Innovation Fund and received further support from the London Business School’s Knowledge Exchange Fund and Micheal’s own digital advisory business, Evolution Ltd., on which Mingyu is also a consultant, supported by a team of advisors including Yuri Romanenkov, Justinas Sukuys, George Alevras and others.
Armed with 277 questionnaire responses as well as engagement with 101 people in 15 workshops and numerous in-depth additional interviews, the researchers found that not all sectors expected to be disrupted in the same way or as dramatically. In the absence of hard data on the technology’s impact to date, the researchers concentrated instead on the way GenAI was used by firms (which self-assessed the impact it had on their firm – ranging from minimal to substantial), as well as the executives’ expectation of industry transformation. Questions covered both individual companies and their business models, and the sectors and ecosystems they belonged to.
This project, which was presented in the IoD with opening remarks by the Minister of State for AI, Jonathan Berry, Viscount Camrose, the Chair of the APPG for AI, Lord Clement Jones, and the proposer of the AI regulation Agency Lord Holmes, looked both at GenAI adoption and its impact. In terms of adoption a key indicator was the extent to which company leaderships were ready to engage with the technology, which tended to vary according to the size of the business. While leadership engagement had a profound influence on how firms integrated and capitalised on GenAI, this was likely to be less of a barrier to adoption in the smallest companies than in larger businesses. As an intriguing aside, the paper suggested that larger organisations that aspired to grow quickly, “such as those owned by private equity,” had to deal with multiple competing claims on their time of energy, so that lack of leadership initiative could be a barrier to adoption.
More interesting yet were the factors that helped gauge when GenAI would have a transformative impact. The researchers found that the importance of pattern recognition to a particular sector or profession and of proprietary data to individual businesses were key to the usefulness of the technology. Concerns about the accuracy and bias of GenAI’s output, questions of regulatory compliance and security and about the availability of professional skills and expertise were among the key barriers to its adoption.
In the longer-term, however, what will count are the characteristics of the technology itself and how these characteristics will play out in its usefulness to particular industries or sectors and whether it is perceived as an asset or a threat.
GenAI may provide “the opportunity to unlock distinctiveness and as such gain a competitive edge”
Anecdotally, for example, the advertising industry is already facing significant disruption, with agencies making layoffs and their clients taking a few operatives in-house to deliver GenAI results directly. The paper duly noted that the entire industry may be “disintermediated or bypassed,” because “a significant proportion of the activity may be performed directly by clients of advertising agencies, who could simply use GenAI tools as opposed to relying on an external provider.” At the same time, however, advertising was also among those sectors, where respondents expected that GenAI might provide “the opportunity to unlock distinctiveness and as such gain a competitive edge”. The importance of pattern recognition in particular was seen as a driver of competitive success. This was also true of a range of sectors from healthcare to law to education.
Another key enabler and differentiating factor among individual companies across many sectors will be the importance each firm places on its proprietary data. The survey revealed that respondents who regarded proprietary data as important “were 63% more likely to believe that GenAI could unlock significant levels of distinctiveness”. The bad news is that GenAI may also lead to greater inequalities between those with existing proprietary data and the resources to gather more and those without the resources to build and digitalise a database. Similarly, those with the resources to “hyper-customise” their products will outpace those less well placed to recognise and exploit client needs and behaviours.
However, there are some sectors which enjoy a considerable amount of protection though either their own professional statutes or public regulation. Michael quipped that lawyers should perhaps in theory be “obliterated” or “blown up” by GenAI, because their work is so heavily based on pattern recognition through case law and standardised contracts that it could easily be replaced by a machine. Yet the reality is they are protected by the regulatory frameworks that they themselves have designed.
As Michael said in a recent speech, “We as a society place some requests and expectations on where we get our advice. And, ironically, it is this requirement for regulation that provides the organisations that run it with the upper hand.”
With these disparities in mind, the paper also calls on policymakers to do their part in setting frameworks for the rollout and adoption of AI among various sectors, and take into account the effects of regulation both to protect and support businesses and the public interest.
""The paper argues that the UK lags behind the European Union, the EU and even China in establishing an overarching regulatory framework for GenAI""
As well as providing targeted support to ensure adoption of GenAI in sectors that are most at risk of widening corporate inequalities, policy makers are asked to look at ways of “democratising” proprietary data where it could lead to broader societal benefits. This could include data sharing that protects individual privacy “while allowing for collective advancements in research and development.” Other policy recommendations include encouraging firms to look beyond cost-cutting to focus on “the new monetisation and revenue opportunities that GenAI can unlock;” redesigning the education system for “a post-GenAI world” by preparing the workforce for new demands; and encouraging regulators, such as the Competition and Markets Authority, both to prevent excessive market concentration and to examine one industry’s use of GenAI on other sectors and their business models.
Finally, the paper argues that the UK lags behind the European Union, the EU and even China in establishing an overarching regulatory framework for GenAI, leaving responsibility instead to existing regulators with narrower remits, in an “approach that risks losing the forest for the trees.” It calls for the creation of an overarching regulator along the lines of – but likely going further than – a private bill under consideration in the House of Lords for the creation of an AI Authority.
The paper was published on the eve of the surprise announcement of a general election in Britain. It remains to be seen which, if any, of its recommendations will be followed through, when the new government inescapably considers how to harness, or partly tame, this significant if ill-understood agent of change. Whichever the case, the study suggests that we still have some way to go to get a better understanding of GenAI – and how to manage its impact.

The challenge
It is widely known that buildings and urban mobility systems are the largest contributors to unsustainable environmental pollution leading to significant negative impacts to people and the natural world.
To dramatically reduce this impact industries and cities need to change their operations and deliver the green transition urgently.
One of the underutilised forces is the creativity of design agencies. However, Finnish design-related companies face challenges in navigating new sustainability goals, as the concept is complex and unclear, extending beyond aesthetics, functionality and even technical aspects.
This research project seeks to explore how digital tools can support community-scale urban design and retrofit projects that promote sustainable and inclusive transitions in our public realm.
What we did
The design research included desk-based research, workshops with researchers and industry partners and the development of a site-specific research activity to test tools and approaches with Master’s students from Aalto University. The knowledge gained through this work was shared and developed through reports, meetings and the shared development of a final project publication.
We contributed to the development of the research proposal, ran design workshops and interviews with research and industry partners and Master’s students to uncover novel approaches to the use of digital tools as part of the design and development of future architecture, urban and mobility plans.
Our initial discovery research suggested the potential of game-like interfaces that bring together designers, environmental science and citizen / stakeholders to codesign visions, missions and models of future environments.
Definition workshops with partners generated a range of alternative tools that built on value-sensitive design, sustainability centred storytelling, futures-based layered pattern making and community playbooks for the green transition.
These were visualised as a web-based toolkit enabled by bringing together practice knowledge and site-specific networks and communities. This platform approach could be supported by language models that are trained on a combination of design knowledge and location-sensitive data mining.
We supported our industry partner, SmartViz, in the development of a prototypical mapping and visualisation tool that used a chat interface to collect and develop prompts from different team members, building on values, missions and personas defined by the research team.
The final phase of the project included a design development review of the prototype, a research paper that reflected on the challenge of developing new narratives for mobility in the city and the use of an audio LLM to digest and playback our research on visualising values.
The green transition is a values problem
It’s discussed by scientists and politicians through the lens of words like mitigation and adaptation - and in the field of mobility through words like ‘avoid’, ‘shift’ and ‘improve’. But do these words actually change our cultural lives or do they assume that our problems can be solved by technologies alone?
There are of course technical solutions to carbon emissions and biodiversity loss, but we have not started bending the curve downwards and the political environment is not looking good.
So, we should place more hope in the role that Finnish culture and Finnish design can bring to the green transition not just locally but through their outreach across Europe and beyond.
Ideas of talkoot - shared community action - and sisu - steady perseverance despite the climate and the conditions - these values are the real drivers of change and they are things that are embedded in Finnish life - from the ritual of the public library and the public sauna to the deep connection between nature, material and space found in works from Aalto to Ala and beyond.
These values can help us to reframe what the green transition means and what our future public realm does, how it feels and what it represents.
In mobility design it may mean moving from avoiding, shifting and improving to activating people and places, sharing our public realm more intensively and creatively and including everyone to create environments where people and nature is welcomed. We’ll have to do this, not just for our own health, happiness and wellbeing but also for the protection and restoration of our natural world.
And, beyond mobility, going back to the key steps in visualising our future, we need to think about how we use technologies. If values are at the heart of the green transition, then how do we visualise them? How do we negotiate our future through design?

Hazel Joseph
Deputy Director of Care Nightingale Hammerson
I was born and raised in Guyana, during my childhood I have always admired my aunt who was a nurse and drew my inspiration and admiration for the nursing profession at age sixteen I completed my secondary school examination known as the Caribbean Examination Certificate (CXC or A levels) and began my nursing career a year later at age seventeen. At age nineteen I qualified as an Assistant nurse (in 1992). I was not being satisfied being an Assistant nurse so I went on to further my nursing career and was qualified as a registered nurse in 2002 where I worked in several hospitals in Guyana before migrating to Montserrat in 2003. My dislike for bedside nursing led me to further my studies as an operating theatre nurse in 2004 where I worked predominantly as a surgical nurse (Scrub Nurse) supporting the surgeons during various surgical operations in 2006 I migrated to the UK (South Wales) where I was assigned to work in a care home. During that working experience, I developed a passion and love for elderly care. During my time working in health and social care. I attend several courses to broaden my knowledge in relation to elderly care in 2009 I migrated to London in search of a better opportunity to develop my career as a leader and more so as a manager within the health and social care fraternity. I have fortunately applied my knowledge and was appointed as Senior Lead Nurse in 90-bed care Within six months of working as a Senior Lead Nurse, I was offered a role as the Clinical Lead Nurse role and this was mainly due to my organizational, management, and leadership skills. In 2012 I was headhunted by a recruitment company and was successfully appointed Unit Manager at Nightingale Hammerson (Nightingale House South London Home) However, not satisfied with the level I was at in relation to the leadership and managerial skills I had attained in practice and the desire to broaden my knowledge. I decided to attend South Thames Colleges in Tooting where I successfully completed a Level 5 Diploma in Leadership for Health and Social Care and Children and Young People's Services. Having attained my QCF level 5 qualification in 2013, I was approached by the Directors of Care of Nightingale Hammerson to become the registered manager of Hammerson House and was appointed as the Registered Manager. It was during this period I was able to practice and develop my leadership and managerial skills. Expand my knowledge and understanding of health and social care in 2017 I worked closely with the Senior Leadership team and successfully decommissioned Hammerson House so it could be reconstructed. Following the decommissioning of Hammers House, I was appointed Education and Development Manager within the organization for a short period and later resigned from the role. During the rebuilding of Hammerson House, I continued to work with other care organizations as a Registered Manager further expanding my leadership and managerial skills within health and social care. In 2020 I was once again approached by the Director of Care to return to Nightingale Hammerson. I was appointed as Care Quality improvement lead for a short period and later the Deputy Director of Care and Registered Manager of Hammerson House in 2021. I currently have the overall responsibility y of managing Hammerson House which has the capacity to house 116 residents and leads a team of over 200 team members.

Hazel Joseph
Deputy Director of Care Nightingale Hammerson
I was born and raised in Guyana, during my childhood I have always admired my aunt who was a nurse and drew my inspiration and admiration for the nursing profession at age sixteen I completed my secondary school examination known as the Caribbean Examination Certificate (CXC or A levels) and began my nursing career a year later at age seventeen. At age nineteen I qualified as an Assistant nurse (in 1992). I was not being satisfied being an Assistant nurse so I went on to further my nursing career and was qualified as a registered nurse in 2002 where I worked in several hospitals in Guyana before migrating to Montserrat in 2003. My dislike for bedside nursing led me to further my studies as an operating theatre nurse in 2004 where I worked predominantly as a surgical nurse (Scrub Nurse) supporting the surgeons during various surgical operations in 2006 I migrated to the UK (South Wales) where I was assigned to work in a care home. During that working experience, I developed a passion and love for elderly care. During my time working in health and social care. I attend several courses to broaden my knowledge in relation to elderly care in 2009 I migrated to London in search of a better opportunity to develop my career as a leader and more so as a manager within the health and social care fraternity. I have fortunately applied my knowledge and was appointed as Senior Lead Nurse in 90-bed care Within six months of working as a Senior Lead Nurse, I was offered a role as the Clinical Lead Nurse role and this was mainly due to my organizational, management, and leadership skills. In 2012 I was headhunted by a recruitment company and was successfully appointed Unit Manager at Nightingale Hammerson (Nightingale House South London Home) However, not satisfied with the level I was at in relation to the leadership and managerial skills I had attained in practice and the desire to broaden my knowledge. I decided to attend South Thames Colleges in Tooting where I successfully completed a Level 5 Diploma in Leadership for Health and Social Care and Children and Young People's Services. Having attained my QCF level 5 qualification in 2013, I was approached by the Directors of Care of Nightingale Hammerson to become the registered manager of Hammerson House and was appointed as the Registered Manager. It was during this period I was able to practice and develop my leadership and managerial skills. Expand my knowledge and understanding of health and social care in 2017 I worked closely with the Senior Leadership team and successfully decommissioned Hammerson House so it could be reconstructed. Following the decommissioning of Hammers House, I was appointed Education and Development Manager within the organization for a short period and later resigned from the role. During the rebuilding of Hammerson House, I continued to work with other care organizations as a Registered Manager further expanding my leadership and managerial skills within health and social care. In 2020 I was once again approached by the Director of Care to return to Nightingale Hammerson. I was appointed as Care Quality improvement lead for a short period and later the Deputy Director of Care and Registered Manager of Hammerson House in 2021. I currently have the overall responsibility y of managing Hammerson House which has the capacity to house 116 residents and leads a team of over 200 team members.

Jane Mills’ Pioneering Journey – Vulcan Sessions Talk
In this short film Jane Mills delves into the realm of text-to-image Generative AI models, experimenting with platforms such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. Initially encountering what she described as “odd and distorted” images, she highlights the evolving landscape of Generative AI images during this period.
“In 2023 the images started to look better,” Jane explains, noting a significant breakthrough as these AI models began capturing intricate details, showcasing her expertise as a fashion specialist, particularly in facial features, colour pallets, fabric textures and embellishments.
By May 2023, AI integration became a reality in the discipline of Fashion teaching. Jane champions the fusion of human creativity with machine efficiency, enabling designers to conceptualise runway shots, intricate patterns, and expressive collages.
Highlighting the importance of designing detailed prompts, Jane illustrates how specifying techniques, mediums, and styles could lead to incredible results, ranging from watercolor cityscapes to photorealistic textures.
Generative AI serves as a powerful tool that provides fresh perspectives, preparing students for the ever-evolving fashion industry. This approach facilitates faster design processes, hones skills, and meets industry demands.

As students gain valuable experience using this transformative technology, they’re not just designing the future of fashion; they’re shaping the way we think about its creation,” she emphasised.",2415,,University of Northampton,17.6,,10145,2415,northampton.ac.uk,,0:00,,,United Kingdom,"media, research materials",4.529227944195172,0.6896551724137931,260,False,2415,"Exploring the Fusion of Fashion and Artificial Intelligence | UON

In highly competitive markets, firms are more motivated to innovate and invest in sustainable data acquisition strategies.”
As long as original training data remains abundantly available, there’s little benefit for AI firms to go out of their way to compensate the original creators. In the setting generative AI for videos, for example, says Alex, a more permissive fair use framework accelerates model development, yielding benefits for all: more revenue for AI companies and content creators, and enhanced outputs for end users.
Granting broader copyright protection to AI-generated content in this scenario also makes sense, especially when the AI development market is competitive, as higher AI copyrightability can stimulate demand of AI product, encouraging innovation. There is a caveat, however: “in markets with limited competition, such protections may disproportionately benefit dominant tech firms, potentially at the expense of consumers and the pace of model advancement.”
What happens when original data becomes scarce?
This all changes when original, human-created data starts to dry up, says Alex. And this is already happening in the world of text.
“Models like ChatGPT have devoured so much historical data that future iterations – GPT 5, 6 and so on—will increasingly depend on fresh content, be that content solely created by humans, or synthetic data carefully curated under human guidance.”
In such a context, incentivising human creators to keep on creating fresh content becomes critical. Failure to compensate creators through adequate copyright mechanisms could slow AI development, says Alex.
And switching out human or hybrid content for pure machine generated data isn’t a viable solution, at least not yet, he warns. “Studies have shown that training AI models exclusively on AI-generated data can degrade model performance to the point of failure. So at least in the near future, we will always need humans in the loop, be they sole creators, co-creators or providing feedback to the machine.”
Running their model through a low data availability scenario, Alex and Angela find that permissive fair use standard and expansive copyright protection for AI content engender certain risks. Crucially, these two policy levers don’t operate in isolation – they interact in ways that regulators must consider carefully.
This illustration was carefully prompted by humans but generated by ChatGPT. Based on the policy recommendation in this article, it should enjoy partial copyright protection.
“If fair use standard is too lenient, it erodes incentives for human creators to produce new content, further narrowing an already strained data pipeline,” explains Alex. “And if AI-generated content is granted strong copyright protection, humans are more likely to adopt AI tools for content creation, doubling down the data availability challenge.”
“You need that fresh training data from human beings. So, if you want to grant more copyright to AI created content, you must also strengthen mechanisms that compensate humans for their original contributions,” Alex argues. “This becomes even more crucial as competition intensifies as demand for fresh data will increase.”
This is a likely scenario, says Alex, as new players from China and elsewhere emerge.
One size does not fit all
For regulators, designing a policy environment that can accommodate an ever-growing appetite for data will require a deep understanding of how different copyright levers interact. The challenge lies in developing regulatory frameworks that are both flexible and context specific. A one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to succeed; instead, a case-by-case approach may prove to be the most effective way forward.
Meanwhile, businesses should pay close attention to the evolving regulatory landscape, says Alex.
“For organisations accelerating their adoption and development of generative AI, the best is to advocate for more agile and responsive regulation, frameworks that can keep pace with technological change,” he advises. “Equally important is being prepared to navigate an increasingly fragmented and diverse regulatory environment across jurisdictions, for they have different regulatory priorities.”
The trade-offs highlighted in this research extend well beyond regulation, says Alex.

Realizing your business model. Getting coached by experienced entrepreneurs. Perhaps even finding the right investor. These are the possibilities open to a select eight start-up founder teams chosen to participate in this year’s WHU Accelerator, running from May 11 to July 4 and hosted by the WHU Entrepreneurship Center. To date, they have already completed roughly half of this intensive eight-week program, gaining invaluable insights for their start-up projects. “With the WHU Accelerator, we want to give aspiring entrepreneurs at our school consistent access to our start-up eco-system’s most powerful resource: the people themselves,” noted Maximilian Eckel, Managing Director of the WHU Entrepreneurship Center. “It’s important to us that the time invested in the Accelerator is put to the best use possible. If we can bring them into contact with the right mentors, then their participation in the program will have been worth the effort.”
This year’s Mentor Mayhem, the most ambitious and rewarding phase of the WHU Accelerator, has been split between the first and fifth weeks of the program. This phase sees participating teams meet with dozens of high-caliber professionals and refine their business models. In the mentor pool this year are two “unicorn” founders, international venture capitalists, two of Germany’s most prominent angel investors, and several serial entrepreneurs.
One trend seen among new start-ups is a strong focus on generative artificial intelligence. And indeed, AI has become an indispensable element of many new business ideas—from novel approaches to training sales staff to transforming how academic research is conducted. Whether potential investors can be won over by this new technology, or if they will show interest in more traditional business models, will be revealed at the program’s finale. The Demo Day will feature all teams pitching their developed business models to potential investors before a live audience.

PlantSalt delivers exactly what its name suggests: the world’s first plant-based salt. And it, unlike sea salt or table salt, provides an ideal balance of sodium-potassium, beneficial to human health and easy on the environment. By comparison, consumption of other types of salt in many Western countries has led to an increase in cardiovascular illness and Alzheimer’s.

A select set of eight entrepreneur teams benefit from the 2024 WHU Accelerator
Realizing your business model. Getting coached by experienced entrepreneurs. Perhaps even finding the right investor. These are the possibilities open to a select eight start-up founder teams chosen to participate in this year’s WHU Accelerator, running from May 11 to July 4 and hosted by the WHU Entrepreneurship Center. To date, they have already completed roughly half of this intensive eight-week program, gaining invaluable insights for their start-up projects. “With the WHU Accelerator, we want to give aspiring entrepreneurs at our school consistent access to our start-up eco-system’s most powerful resource: the people themselves,” noted Maximilian Eckel, Managing Director of the WHU Entrepreneurship Center. “It’s important to us that the time invested in the Accelerator is put to the best use possible. If we can bring them into contact with the right mentors, then their participation in the program will have been worth the effort.”
This year’s Mentor Mayhem, the most ambitious and rewarding phase of the WHU Accelerator, has been split between the first and fifth weeks of the program. This phase sees participating teams meet with dozens of high-caliber professionals and refine their business models. In the mentor pool this year are two “unicorn” founders, international venture capitalists, two of Germany’s most prominent angel investors, and several serial entrepreneurs.
One trend seen among new start-ups is a strong focus on generative artificial intelligence. And indeed, AI has become an indispensable element of many new business ideas—from novel approaches to training sales staff to transforming how academic research is conducted. Whether potential investors can be won over by this new technology, or if they will show interest in more traditional business models, will be revealed at the program’s finale. The Demo Day will feature all teams pitching their developed business models to potential investors before a live audience.
