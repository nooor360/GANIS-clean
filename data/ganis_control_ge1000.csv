During World War II, over one million people lost their lives there, primarily Jewish, but also Poles, Romanian, and Russian. The site has been preserved, and students participate in a day-long formal guided tour.
The Hague
Established in 2002, the International Criminal Court has the jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Often referred to as the World Court, the International Court of Justice is the main judicial organ of the United Nations.
Both courts are visited, with official guides and interactive events with court staff. Additionally, students receive a tour and presentation from the staff at the Residual Special Court for Sierra Leone. Students also have the opportunity on the day of arrival to enjoy the beautiful city of Amsterdam with its canals and museums.
Nuremberg
At the end of the Second World War Nuremberg was the site of the first-ever international war crime trials that helped lay the basis of all modern human rights legislation. The main trial of 24 of the most central participants in the Holocaust took a year to complete.
Students visit the original courtrooms as part of an official guided tour including interactive workshops and presentations. Nuremberg itself is a beautiful walled medieval city complete with a castle and students have a day to enjoy its shops and many attractions.

The target award is LLM in Contemporary Legal Studies.
Students completing LA7001 Developing and Managing Research will gain the knowledge required to design and manage an independent research topic in the field of contemporary legal studies. Students will develop an appreciation of the common law tradition and how it fits into the English Legal System, through LA7003 Legal Theory in the Common Law, and more broadly with the international legal system through LA7002 Conflict of Laws. These are compulsory 20 credit modules and will allow students to develop and demonstrate a range of skills, knowledge and techniques applicable to their own research or advanced scholarship. These attributes will be further developed and tested during the programme.
Students are given a choice of three specialised modules in the areas of tort, employment and discrimination, criminal and environmental law.
Please note that all option modules reflect current staff research specialism and may not be offered every year. The programme team consider that a minimum of 10 students is required on each of the option modules to ensure that the learning activities in the taught sessions allow students to demonstrate a systematic understanding of the subject area.
The last semester will comprise of LA7009 (if full time) and the research proposal which forms the assessment for LA7001 should be the basis of the dissertation to be produced in this module.
If the proposal includes a level of empirical research then that research proposal will be submitted to the Law School Ethics Committee at the start of the second semester.
The semester-based delivery offers students taking the programme on a part-time basis a greater level of flexibility. Students may, for example, choose to take the entire first semester of modules in their first year and the second semester modules and dissertation the following year.
Alternatively they may choose to take a different combination of modules across each semester and each year (for instance, 2+1 in Year 1; 1+2 and dissertation in Year 2).
Exit Awards:
Postgraduate Certificate:
60 credits.
A student can complete 3 X 20 credit Level 7 modules on the programme (out of those modules offered in the first two semesters) and exit with a post graduate certificate.
Postgraduate Diploma:
120 credits.
If a student completes 6 X 20 credit Level 7 modules on the programme (out of those modules offered in the first two semesters) they can exit with a postgraduate diploma.
LLM (Masters in Law):
180 credits.
All students must complete 180 credits at Level 7 on this programme to exit with a LLM in Contemporary Legal Studies.
An applicant will need a minimum of a 2:2 (lower second class) honours degree, or the equivalent, in law or a combined law degree.
Alternatively a student will have either successfully completed the GDL (Graduate Diploma in Law) or have completed the Level 6 CILEX qualifications.
Credit exemption may be given for appropriate certified or experiential learning undertaken or completed within the previous five years (in line with the University of Chester’s policy on APL/APEL).
Admission to this Programme is subject to written application and an acceptable entry qualification profile.
However applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of written work, and in some instances an interview may take place.
Where the applicant is a recent graduate, the written work could take the form of an essay on an area of law which formed part of their undergraduate degree; other applicants may be invited to write a short essay (up to 1,500 words) on a current issue relating to the English Legal System.
Applicants will be qualified at IELTS level 7 or equivalent (if English is not the applicant's first language).
There are as yet no subject benchmarks for the programme.
Accordingly, the LLM Contemporary Legal Studies will accord with the descriptor for a qualification at master's level included in the QAA's 'Framework for Higher Education Qualifications' (October 2014) and with the more detailed description of defining characteristics in the QAA's Characteristics Statement for Master's Degree (February 2020).
Many of the learning outcomes outlined in section 26 (and the educational aims of the programme) are derived from these documents.
A wide range of learning and teaching methods are used, including lectures, seminars, workshops, audio-visual presentation, tutorials, guided reading and private study, supplemented where appropriate by visiting lecturers/ legal practitioners.
Assessment and feedback:
Feedback is available on all summative work, and there are opportunities throughout the course for formative feedback during module sessions, to include that which is provided orally through class-discussion.The primary methods of assessment on all modules will be by essay or written problem answer and dissertation. A range of other assessments used include, oral exam or timed classroom assessment; oral presentations (in a range of formats); research proposal and 15,000 word dissertation.
Five modules have an element of oral presentation in them.
LA7002 Conflict of Laws requires the student to participate in a viva voce on their coursework.
LA7003 Legal Theory in Common Law requires the student to participate in an interview on their coursework.
LA7007 Employment and Discrimination Law requires the student to participate in an interview on their coursework
LA7012 Environmental Justice requires students to participate in an assessed group presentation taking the form of a debate/discussion.
There are 5,000 words of assessment (or equivalent) allocated to each of the taught modules, while the dissertation is 15,000 words.
These word limits are within the University’s guidelines. The amount of assessment required is thus modelled on currently successful and comparable programmes, is appropriate to the discipline, and ensures parity between comparable courses.
Graduates of the Programme will have acquired a range of skills and competencies valuable to employers. Those graduates who wish to continue their studies towards an MPhil or PhD will be well-equipped with both key skills and subject knowledge.
It is also recognised that some graduates of the Programme will have taken it for pleasure and personal development rather than to enhance their employment prospects or prepare for further study.
The critical skills students will have acquired and developed will enable them to interpret, analyse, and evaluate very different types of legally related material.
They will be expert communicators, with refined expressive and listening skills, who can present, discuss, and share their ideas and the ideas of others with individuals and groups, both fluently and sensitively.
They will be highly motivated individuals who can see complex projects through from conception to completion, working well to deadlines.
They will be able to respond well to advice and guidance, but will also be autonomous learners with a self-disciplined approach to their responsibilities.
The students will have high-level researching skills and be able to apply their knowledge and research findings practically to the completion of a range of tasks, particularly if working within the legal sector
However, they will also be reflective learners, with an ability to criticise their own work in a way likely to continue to help them develop their skills after graduation.
Most importantly, they will be highly organised and knowledgeable individuals capable of disciplined thought and expression, able to solve problems and overcome difficulties whether working alone or in teams.
Such skills are clearly transferable to a whole range of professional contexts but will be particularly useful for those either already working in the legal sector or for those contemplating working in this area.
Some graduates may wish to proceed to a research degree. Others will want to apply their skills to the workplace.
The University is committed to the promotion of diversity, equality and inclusion in all its forms; through different ideas and perspectives, age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. We are, in particular, committed to widening access to higher education. Within an ethically aware and professional environment, we acknowledge our responsibilities to promote freedom of enquiry and scholarly expression.
The Programme conforms to the University’s Equal Opportunities Policy and the appropriate Codes of Practice. The Law School is fully committed to the support of all its students, whatever their circumstances. Over the years, the Law School has sought advice and received training in the support of students with a wide variety of disabilities or specific needs.
Within Law, much of the subject matter naturally affords a range of cultural perspectives and this is particularly so in such modules as Conflicts of Law and Employment and Discrimination Law. The LLM is designed to encourage students to think about the theoretical, philosophical and practical nature of law and these inherently promote the discussion of diversity and equality.
Indeed, it is difficult to think of many modules that do not have some content regarding these issues.
There is flexibility in materials and delivery of teaching to support students with disability or from culturally diverse backgrounds and the Law School works closely with Learning Support in delivering this support.
The induction activities are designed to integrate all students both academically and socially and to make academic staff aware of any such issues. The Law School takes an active part in the University’s Diversity Festival.
There is flexibility in materials and delivery of teaching to support students with disability or from culturally diverse backgrounds and the Law School works closely with Learning Support in delivering this support. The induction activities have been designed to integrate all students both academically and socially and to make academic staff aware of any such issues.
All lecturers are aware of diversity issues and discharge their PAT roles with knowledge and sympathy.
The University of Chester is taking steps to mitigate the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, whilst ensuring an excellent academic experience for our students. During the 2021-22 academic year, it is anticipated that the University will deliver programmes of study in a mode of blended online and face to face sessions. This statement describes how this will be implemented and should be read in conjunction with section 28 of this document.
The hybrid model has been designed to safeguard the interests of students whilst upholding the University’s academic standards. This ensures that students can engage in high quality learning and teaching to support them to achieve the learning outcomes for this programme, irrespective of the prevailing conditions.
Large group teaching will be delivered online and may be a mix of synchronous and asynchronous delivery depending on the material to be delivered.
Seminars and workshops may be designed flexibly so that they can be conducted either online or in small group settings where this can be achieved safely.
Assessments will be designed flexibly so that they can be completed remotely in the event that access to the campus is restricted.

How you'll study
You will be taught by a mixture of lectures, seminars and workshops.
Joining our LLB Law programme means you’re embarking on an immersive learning experience, with opportunities to practise your mooting and negotiation skills in our on-campus Moot Court Room, provide legal advice to the community in our Law Clinic or act as a criminal defence lawyer in our ‘Crime House’.
All students will also receive support in developing their academic legal skills, as well as transferable skills, through our Legal Skills sessions, Uniskills workshops and Careers Team events.
How you'll be assessed
Throughout the degree there is a combination of different forms of assessment to test intellectual development, vocational capability and critical thinking.

You may be assessed via exams, coursework, presentations, practical assessments or a portfolio submission.
All students will receive assessment support in each module and will have access to additional support via Uniskills. You will also receive timely feedback throughout the module and after each assessment.
Who will be teaching you
You will be taught by highly qualified, experienced and enthusiastic academics, who research and write about the law and are experts in their particular specialisms. Some of the team are both academics and practitioners and others are involved in international projects, training judges and lawyers in European Union law. All are actively engaged in the world of the law and legal institutions.
Where your course includes optional modules, these are to provide an element of choice within the course curriculum. The availability of optional modules may vary from year to year and will be subject to minimum student numbers being achieved. This means that the availability of specific optional modules cannot be guaranteed. Optional module selection may also be affected by timetabling requirements. Some restrictions on optional module choice or combinations of optional modules may apply.
Your future career
Whether you are planning a career in the legal profession or a career in another field of expertise, our law programme will develop and inspire you to reach your career goals.
Our LLB law degrees are qualifying law degrees, so you’ll graduate with the key skills and knowledge required to enter the legal profession. Upon graduating, you can then undertake the required further legal training to become a solicitor or barrister, including our LLM SQE/Legal Practice if you wish to qualify as a solicitor.
The transferable skills which you gain from our programmes also mean that a wide variety of doors are open to you whether in the legal sector, criminal justice system, civil service, public relations, accountancy or business and marketing.
Our recent law graduates have secured positions as Senior Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, in-house solicitor at BAE Systems, Legal Director at Moderna and barrister at 4 King’s Bench Walk Chambers.
As a School, we are committed to enhancing your employability and helping you to find the right career path for you and that is why 98% of our Law students are employed or in further study 15 months after graduation (Graduate Outcomes data released 2024 from 2021/22 graduates).

Academic Offences Regulations
12. Academic offences
12.1 Academic offences principles
12.1.1 The Academic Offences regulations will be used to deal with any cases of academic misconduct including examination offences, plagiarism and other means of cheating to obtain an advantage.
12.1.2 Offences relating to an invigilated examination, coursework or other assessment include:
- Research misconduct;
- purchasing and selling of work;
- fabrication of experimental results, research or other investigative work;
- failure to gain prior ethical approval;
- plagiarism;
- unauthorised access to an examination paper before an examination;
- forgery;
- removal of a question paper, answer script or other examination stationery from an examination venue or any other University premises;
- causing a disturbance during an examination;
- refusal to cooperate with an invigilator or to follow an invigilator’s instructions;
- possession of unauthorised materials whilst under examination conditions, or leaving unauthorised material in an examination venue (including toilets);
- access to, possession of or use of unauthorised material on, a computer, mobile telephone, or other electronic device during an examination;
- communicating with another candidate while under examination conditions;
- copying, or attempting to copy, the work of another candidate;
- having writing on the body in an examination venue;
- impersonation of another student in an examination or assessment, or the employment of an impersonator in an examination or assessment;
- the fraudulent reporting of source material;
- the fraudulent reporting of experimental results, research or other investigative work;
- collusion in the preparation or production of submitted work, including supplying work to facilitate academic misconduct, unless such joint or group work is explicitly permitted;
- use, or attempted use, of ghost writing services for any part of an assessment;
- misuse of generative artificial intelligence tools in preparation or production of submitted work;
- submission of work, or sections of work, for assessment in more than one module or assessment (including work previously submitted for assessment at another institution);
- all other forms of cheating.
12.1.3 Marking of work will not be suspended during any investigation or allegation of academic misconduct, although the result will be withheld until the investigation is complete.
12.1.4 Students may present any extenuating circumstances to the Academic Offence Panel, although they may do this once only. Where an allegation of an Academic Offence is proven, applications for mitigation cannot be considered.
12.2 Plagiarism
12.2.1 The University defines plagiarism as the practice of taking someone else’s work and/or ideas and passing it/them off as their own. It is also, where a student represents someone else’s work as their own irrespective of whether this was intended. Close paraphrasing, without adequate attribution; copying from the work of another person, including another student; using the ideas of another person without proper acknowledgement, all constitute examples of plagiarism. In addition, where a student re-uses work, whether in part or in whole that they have previously submitted for graded assessment – at the University or another institution - without properly referencing themselves (known as ‘self- plagiarism’) shall also constitute plagiarism.
12.3 Poor academic practice
12.3.1 This can only be applied to students in their first year of study at the University. Where the Course Leader, or authorised nominee, determines that the first offence is due to poor academic practice*, the following course of action shall apply:
*poor academic practice - this is where a first academic offence has been committed due to lack of knowledge of academic writing. This is also to be used where plagiarism has been identified as resulting from a lack of understanding and poor academic practice.
- advise the student to obtain further support and guidance in referencing skills and;
- require the student to submit a corrected version of the element of assessment at the same attempt within five working days following the meeting;
- ensure that a letter will be retained on the student’s file to this effect for the period of one year, or where it is longer, for the duration of that level of study.
12.3.2 Poor Academic Practice cases will normally be concluded within 10 working days of the receipt of the case and will be dealt with internally by the Course Leader, or authorised nominee within the School/College. Where a student commits a further offence this should be considered as a Minor Offence or a Major Offence depending on the level of severity.
12.4 Severity of academic offences
12.4.1 Academic offences shall be dealt with according to the severity of the offence as follows:
- Minor offence - includes first offence of plagiarism, or other minor offence resulting from negligence or intent, where a student attempted to acknowledge their sources and/or comply with the regulations for assessment, but a minor oversight or error has given cause for concern, and the student could benefit from further academic advice and referral for support.
- Major offence - includes subsequent minor offences of plagiarism, all examination offences and all other serious offences, all of which require referral to the University Registrar for further investigation by the Academic Offences Panel.
12.4.2 In the case of a proven academic offence with a penalty requiring the submission of assessment, the submission must take place at the earliest opportunity during the current academic year and/or by the deadline set by the School/College.
12.4.3 Where a student does not submit as required by an academic offence penalty, a mark of 0 shall be given for the element(s) of assessment in which the offence occurred.
12.4.4 All academic offences and outcomes must be reported to Academic Registry, where a record will be kept.
12.5 Minor offence
12.5.1 A student suspected of committing a minor academic offence shall be invited to attend an interview with the Head of Subject, or authorised nominee, and shall be given copies of all evidence submitted in support of the allegation.
12.5.2 Notice of five working days will be given to the student of the interview date, time and venue.
12.5.3 Students should contact the Head of Subject, or authorised nominee, within five working days of notification of the allegation to make alternative arrangements if they are unable to make the original proposed date. If the student is unable to attend the next arranged date, the interview will proceed in their absence.
12.5.4 Where a student fails to attend or make alternative arrangements, the investigation will proceed in the absence of the student, and consideration will be given to the documentation available.
12.5.5 A student may be accompanied to the interview by a friend or Students’ Union representative. Under no circumstances may the student have legal representation or be represented by an external organisation.
12.5.6 All minor offence interviews will be conducted within the School/College according to the standard procedures issued by Academic Registry.
12.5.7 As part of an interview, if the case warrants it, a student may be tested on subject knowledge by an oral examination. The oral examination shall be conducted by two members of academic staff with knowledge of the subject who will submit a report to the Head of Subject.
12.5.8 Where a minor offence is proven, the Head of Subject or authorised nominee, will ensure that one of the following penalties will be applied:
- where the Head of Subject or authorised nominee considers the offence to be poor academic practice, those related penalties will apply.
- failure (a mark of 0) in the element(s) of assessment in which the offence occurred, with the maximum mark of the next available attempt capped at the pass mark; and impose a formal reprimand to be retained on the student’s file for the duration of the course of study. If the resubmitted work incurs further academic offence allegations, the case will be referred to a Major Academic Offences Panel.
12.5.9 All minor offence cases referred to the Head of Subject, or authorised nominee, will normally be concluded within 20 working days of the receipt of the case and will be dealt with internally by the School/College.
12.5.10 Where the Head of Subject, or authorised nominee, determines following the interview, that there is evidence of an academic offence in an assessment that cannot be dealt with as a minor offence, the Head of Subject, or authorised nominee, will refer the case as a major offence within five working days to the University Registrar or authorised designate, who shall be responsible for investigating the case.
12.6 Major offence
12.6.1 Invigilators, assessors or Module Leaders who suspect a student of committing an academic offence in an examination shall immediately inform the University Registrar, or their authorised nominee, who shall be responsible for investigating the allegation as a major offence.
12.6.2 Where a member of staff suspects that a major offence has been committed as part of any assessment, the Module Leader or assessor shall immediately notify the Head of Subject or authorised nominee. This should be referred to the University Registrar or authorised designate where it is a major offence within five working days.
12.6.3 A student accused of committing a major offence shall be invited to an Academic Offences Panel investigation by the University Registrar or authorised designate and shall be given copies of all evidence submitted in support of the allegation.
12.6.4 An Academic Offences Panel shall be convened with responsibility for determining whether assessment related offences have been committed and will determine penalties, where applicable.
12.6.5 Notice of a minimum of five working days will be given to the student of the Academic Offences Panel investigation date, time and venue.
12.6.6 A student may be accompanied to the Academic Offences Panel investigation by a friend or Students’ Union representative. Under no circumstances may the student have legal representation or be represented by an external organisation.
12.6.7 As part of an investigation, a student may be tested on subject knowledge by an oral examination. In such cases, the oral examination shall be conducted by a minimum of two academic staff, with knowledge of the subject, who shall submit a report to the Academic Offences Panel.
12.6.8 Students should contact the University Registrar or authorised designate within five working days of notification of the allegation to make alternative arrangements if they are unable to make the original proposed date. If the student is unable to attend the next arranged date, the Academic Offences Panel will proceed in their absence.
12.6.9 The Academic Offences Panel investigation should proceed where a student fails to attend or make alternative arrangements, and the Panel will consider the case in the absence of the student and make a decision on the documentation available.
12.6.10 On completion of the Academic Offences Panel investigation, the University Registrar or authorised designate shall notify the student of the outcome of the case.
12.6.11 The Academic Offences Panel shall comprise:
- a member of academic staff who is a trained Chair, appointed by the authority of the Vice-Chancellor and President. If for any reason the Chair is unable to act, the Vice-Chancellor and President or authorised nominee shall appoint an alternative Chair;
- a member of academic staff from the same School/College to that of the student;
- a member of academic staff from a different School/College to that of the student;
- in attendance, an authorised nominee from Academic Registry to act as Secretary to the Panel.
12.6.12 The Academic Offences Panel shall have the authority to act in cases where a student admits or does not deny an offence.
12.6.13 The Secretary is responsible for advising the Academic Offences Panel on the Academic Regulations. In the event of the Panel being divided over a decision to be taken, the Chair shall have a second and casting vote to determine the decision.
12.6.14 If it is determined that a major offence has been committed, the student’s file/record will be made available to the Panel at this stage along with the student’s transcript. In arriving at a decision on penalties to be applied, the Panel will take account of any previous offences on record and shall impose the penalties on an individual basis; in cases involving a group of students, each individual will be considered separately.
12.6.15 If during the course of the Academic Offences Panel investigation, evidence of further academic offences is revealed, the penalties will also apply to those modules affected.
12.6.16 In deciding the appropriate formal penalty, the Academic Offences Panel will consider the following criteria, as supported by the necessary evidence:
- Premeditation in order to gain an unfair advantage.
- Intention in order to gain an unfair advantage.
- Acting for financial gain.
- Abusing a position of trust.
- Previously proven allegations.
12.6.17 Where a major offence is proven, the Academic Offences Panel shall impose a formal reprimand to be retained on the student’s file for the duration of the course of study and one of the following penalties for each module for which an academic offence is found to have been committed:
- where the Panel considered the offence to be a minor offence or poor academic practice, those related penalties will apply.
- failure (a mark of 0) in the element(s) of assessment in which the offence occurred, with the maximum mark of the next available attempt, capped at the pass mark;
- failure (a mark of 0) in the module of which the assessment forms a part, with the maximum module mark on any resit of the module capped at the pass mark; If the assessment is a resit attempt, the student will be required to retake the module, and the module will be capped at the pass mark;
- discontinuation of studies at the University.
12.6.18 In cases where the Panel concludes the student has breached other regulations or policies, such as the Student Code of Conduct in addition to academic misconduct, it may be appropriate to also refer the matter under the Student Disciplinary Procedures or the Fitness to Practise Procedures. This will normally result in consideration of penalties only.
12.6.19 The outcome of all cases shall be confirmed to the student in writing, copying in the Head/Dean or School/College, Head of Subject and Head of Academic Administration.
12.6.20 All major offence cases will normally be concluded within 20 working days of the receipt of the case referral from the School/College, and will be dealt with by the University Registrar or authorised designate. The total time to conclude a major offence case is normally 25 working days.
12.7 Appeals

It is commonly used by people to describe any piece of technology that mimics human learning and problem solving skills.
The term is used to describe everything from finding the best route on Google Maps, self-driving cars, algorithms to display a list in a certain order on a website or in a social media app, and facial recognition software to unlock a smart phone. It is part of our everyday lives, at work, in university and at home. Developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have progressed at an incredible rate, and are predicted to impact many areas of society, including education in the coming years.
One such development is the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI). AI systems that are generative have the ability to produce text, images, or other forms of media in response to prompts. A prompt (or prompt engineering) is the command or instruction you enter into a generative AI system to create a desired output - for example, a piece of written text or an image relating to a particular topic, idea, person, and so on.
This guide will help students and staff explore a range of generative AI technologies and consider how these technologies might affect their teaching and learning practice.
The University of South Wales (USW) is committed to leveraging generative AI for the benefit of students and staff, and promotes the fair, ethical, professional, and responsible use of generative AI tools.
The University is committed to preparing our students for an increasingly AI-enabled future and acknowledges digital fluency as a key USW graduate attribute.

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), also known as Large Language Models (LLMs), can generate multi-modal content based on human prompts and are making a significant impact on the field of education. The rapid development of tools, such as ChatGPT, present substantial challenges in terms of assessment and maintaining academic integrity, but they also offer valuable opportunities to enrich and personalise student learning experiences.
The University of South Wales (USW) is committed to leveraging generative AI for the benefit of students and staff, and promotes the fair, ethical, professional, and responsible use of generative AI tools. The University is committed to preparing our students for an increasingly AI-enabled future and acknowledge digital fluency as a key USW graduate attribute.
The University has strict guidelines on student conduct and academic integrity. These stress that students must be the authors of their own work. Content produced with generative AI platforms, such as ChatGPT, without an approved method of declaration and/or prior academic approval, does not represent the student’s own original work so could be considered a form of academic misconduct to be dealt with under the University's Academic Misconduct procedures.
Students are encouraged to engage collaboratively with our staff to uphold the academic integrity of our awards and maintain the University’s core values of being Professional, Responsive, Creative, Inspiring and Collaborative that are at the heart of our community.
The University will continue to monitor the developments of generative AI and is committed to ensuring student and staff are supported with guidance as this technology evolves.

If you enjoy thinking and working on your own and writing/rewriting essays this is suitable for you. You will have the opportunity to develop organisational and research skills by undertaking a piece of work of your own choice, which must be organised, researched and completed as a written project. You also need to be able to work well with a supervisor (a member of the Law School staff).
Human Rights & Equality (Core Modules)
This module aims to further examine the law in the area of equality and human rights. You will explore the debates and complexities around the concepts of equality and human rights through an analysis of legal frameworks and comparative materials.

Caption.Ed AI Summaries:
Operates under ISO certification.
Caption.Ed’s new AI Summaries feature can automatically summarise audio recordings. This tool works by processing the spoken content and providing a condensed version, which highlights the main points. It can be particularly useful for summarising meetings, lectures, or interviews. However, as with any AI tool, it is important to consider how well the tool performs depending on the clarity of the audio and the complexity of the conversation. Like many other transcription tools, Caption.Ed may require some post-editing to ensure accuracy, especially in cases with specialised language or unclear speech.
A student guide to…Ethical use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
When using AI tools to turn audio into text or summarise it, there are some important things to think about:
Key Things to Consider:
- Audio Quality: Make sure the audio is clear, with little background noise and that the speakers are easy to hear.
- Speaker Clarity: Check if the speakers talk clearly. They should not mumble or talk too softly.
- Accent Recognition: Use an AI tool that understands the accents of the speakers to avoid mistakes.
- Language Support: Make sure the AI tool can understand the language of the audio.
- Accuracy Level: Know how accurate the AI tool is. Make sure it is good enough for what you need.
- Privacy Concerns: Be careful with privacy. Make sure the AI service keeps sensitive information safe and follows privacy rules.
- Post-Editing Needs: You may need to edit the transcript yourself after the AI has finished. This is important if the audio is complicated or has mistakes.
- Context-Specific Considerations:
- Legal Transcription: Needs to be very accurate, especially for legal terms and timestamps.
- Medical Transcription: Needs a special AI tool that understands medical words.
- Research Transcription: Needs to accurately capture unusual speech patterns or special words.

There are also lots of useful video guides on Microsoft Teams in LinkedInLearning which is free to access for Edge Hill students and staff.
If you need any help and support logging into Office 365 then contact the Catalyst Helpdesk.
Internet Connection / WiFi
Ensure you have a steady connection – preferably a strong WiFi signal or better still a computer that is plugged directly into your router or modem.
Bandwidth
There may be occasions when bandwidth is restricted (the amount of data that can be sent and received at any one time). If you are experiencing lag, jumping, drop-out or other issues, try switching off your video and encourage others to do the same especially if in a large group. If a person isn’t speaking, ask them to turn off their microphone too (this will also help with background noise)
Firewalls
If you are in a hospital, or similar setting, there may be firewalls that will block your access or restrict your connection in some way (especially if trying to use video). You may need to connect via your data connection on your phone or use a different computer. Try to take the time to test your setup first before your session, especially if using equipment for the first time.
Complete loss of internet
Check with your broadband provider to find out if the problem is temporary. If you are due to submit a piece of assessed work online, get in touch with your tutor as soon as you can to explain the situation.
Recommended Web Browsers
There is a choice of web browsers available, and most devices will come with one installed, but we would recommend using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or the last version of Microsoft Edge for the best experience (as opposed to Safari or Microsoft Edge/Internet Explorer).
If you are having any trouble accessing a link or joining a session a good tip would be to check if any functions are being blocked by your browser, specifically in Google Chrome. If you are joining a Blackboard Collaborate session ensure you allow third-party plugins, if prompted, for Collaborate to work in your web browser.
Audio
If you are joining a webinar, online tutorial or online meeting it is important to check your computer is picking up the correct equipment so you are able to take part in the conversation.
Microphone
This could be a built-in microphone, external microphone (plugged into the microphone socket of your computer or laptop), a headset (aux/mini jack into your computer or USB) or even a Bluetooth headset or hands-free set. With so many options your device may pick up multiple input options so is important to choose the right one.
Audio
Make sure that the correct output is also set. You may be using wireless or Bluetooth headphones, wired headphones (jack or USB), built-in or external speakers. Ensure that the sound is set to come out of the one you are expecting. For the best experience, we recommend headphones. By using headphones you can avoid any audio leak, or feedback, via the microphone which can make it difficult to hear.
Device Permissions
If you need to install any hardware, such as an external microphone, it is important to check you have permissions to install them on your device. This is also important to check if you need to add any additional software, such as web browsers or Panopto (if recording). Make sure you have admin rights and that your operating system (OS) allows you to make any necessary changes.

There are several apps or software tools available to assist with writing. If you use these you must ensure that they are not creating the content for you, and that the ideas and arguments are your own. If you are unsure whether an app is permitted, you should contact your tutor.
Turnitin has developed a check to indicate how much of a document is generated by AI. This may include text written by any form of AI, such as GPT based tools, translation tools and grammar checking tools.
If Turnitin identifies a high AI% in a submission, you may be asked to attend a viva to discuss your work. Keeping drafts of every version of your work to show what the app or tool gave you, and how you developed this.
Basic spell checking and grammar checking should not change the meaning of the written text, but if you are using more complex checking, you must ensure that they do not change or improve the arguments, meaning or ideas.
They should also not change the language beyond your own understanding, as you should be able to explain the meaning of your work.
Where you use tool such as Grammarly to check your work, you must keep the original draft without the changes, so that you can show the development of the work if requested.
It is not permitted to use a human translator, or translation apps or software to translate large parts (or all of) your assignment.
If you choose to write your work in your first language before translating to English, you must translate it yourself.
It would be acceptable to use translation apps to check words and/or phrases, but not to translate the whole document. You should also acknowledge which translation app or tool that you use, and how you use it.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is capable of generating text itself, without requiring a draft document. However, if you include text generated by AI in your work this could mean that you risk submitting work that is not your own writing and ideas, which would be an academic offence.
You should check with your tutor whether it is permitted to use AI in any form when writing your assignment.
If you do use text generated by AI, you should reference it. Cite Them Right has guidance on how to reference AI.
While ChatGPT is probably the most well known AI, there are several others available online. While they are similar, they might not always provide the same results.

We're so pleased you’d like to join us at Beds and become part of our vibrant, diverse student community. We have an excellent reputation for preparing students for employment so your bright future starts here.
We want you to have a smooth application journey so we've made it as straightforward as possible – and our Admissions team are on hand if you have any queries.
If you know what course/s you wish to apply for, it's a good idea to refer to the individual course description for any specific application guidance as well as reading the information in this section.
Whether you apply via UCAS, the Department for Education or directly, you will have to provide references. Find out more about providing your references
For UK students, the normal application route for full-time study is online via the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS).
- If you are in full-time education, your school or college will help you register with UCAS and make your application; it will also supply your reference
- If you are returning to learning after a break or you are a mature student (over 21), you apply independently through UCAS and find your own referee
- If you are a mature student but still have contact with your old school/college, you can ask them if they will support your application and be your referee
Find out more about providing your reference
Every course has its own UCAS course code; if your chosen course doesn’t have one yet, it is likely to be because it is a new course still awaiting its code. In these cases, please contact our Admissions team at admission@
Information and payment required
The UCAS application form allows you to choose up to five courses; to add University of Bedfordshire courses, it’s useful to have to hand the UCAS code for your course and our UCAS codes – you’ll find these at the base of the page. The form will also need relevant personal details, education and employment history, and a personal statement, written by you - all of which can take some time to gather together. UCAS offers information about completing your application; our tips on writing your personal statement and jargon buster [PDF] will also build your confidence.
The final section to fill in is payment. If you are applying through a school that has an alternative payment arrangement with UCAS, you will not see the payment screen. Otherwise, you pay the application fee online using a credit or debit card. For the 2024 applicant cycle, there is a flat fee of £27.50 for up to five course choices; for 2025 entry, the fee is £28.50 for up to five choices. For the 2025 cycle, the fee may be waived if you have been in receipt of free school meals at some point during your secondary education.
After applying, it’s possible you will be invited for an interview. If you have any dates you already know of when you won’t be available for interview, it’s an idea to include them on your UCAS application.
Timings and deadlines
Once your application is completed, either you or your school will send it electronically to UCAS, who process it and send a copy to your chosen universities and colleges. We expect to receive most UCAS applications from early/mid September to mid/late January for courses starting in the following academic year. Applications received after the January deadline are considered late applications but you can still contact Admissions at admission@ to see if we have places available for your preferred course.
Deadlines change slightly every year. Please check out the application timetable for your year of entry at . Download our Key Dates calendar [PDF] and personalise it with your entry-year deadlines.
If you have problems applying online to UCAS, please contact the UCAS Customer Service team on 0371 468 0468 (Mon-Fri, 8.30am-6pm). You can also reach them via a direct message on Facebook (ucasonline) or X (@ucas_online).
Clearing starts at the beginning of July and normally continues to the end of September.
There are a number of reasons why you might ‘go into Clearing’. For college leavers, it might be that results’ day didn’t bring the grades needed. You may have changed your mind about the subject you want to study. Or you could have only just decided that you’d like to go to uni. Whatever led you there, you can find the perfect course through Clearing.
If you are applying to the University of Bedfordshire during Clearing, check out our applicants’ guide to Clearing, which takes you step by step through the process.
Most part-time courses do not have specific application deadlines. Once you have chosen your part-time course, you apply directly to the University of Bedfordshire via our online admissions portal, accessed from the relevant course page on our website. This also applies if you are looking for a part-time place during Clearing. However, for main cycle (non-Clearing) applications, we advise you to apply at least 30 days before the course starts to allow us time to process your application.
We offer around 130 Master’s (MA/MSc/LLM) and professional courses (MProf) at the University of Bedfordshire as well as research degrees (MA/MSc by Research/MPhil/PhD) affiliated to one of our 10 research institutes. Many courses offer part-time options and multiple start times to make studying easier to fit around life and work.
Postgraduate taught courses
Once you have chosen your course, you should apply via our online application portal, accessed directly from our website course pages. Most postgraduate courses do not have specific application deadlines but we advise you to apply at least 30 days before the course starts to allow us time to process your application.
There are some courses that require students to apply via UCAS or the Department for Education; in these cases, it is flagged up on both the prospectus and website course descriptions.
Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE)
All applications for a PGCE course should be made online through the Department for Education Teaching Training portal. You can make up to four choices from late October. Our Admissions team will assess your application as quickly as possible, your DfE record will be updated and you will also receive an email detailing the decision.
Research degrees
Research degree applications are managed by the Research Graduate School. You should email the Research Graduate School and you will then be advised on the application process relevant to your subject area. Once your application is received, it will be considered by the relevant research institute.
Full-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses: apply through UCAS, following the guidance given under Applying for full-time undergraduate courses.
Part-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses: once you have chosen your part-time course, you can apply directly to the University of Bedfordshire via our online admissions portal, accessed from the course page on our website.
Continuing professional development for registered healthcare practitioners: apply for degree- and Master’s-level top-up studies or a range of short courses through our NHS Business Unit at nhs-business-unit@ or via the switchboard on (0)1234 400 400.
“I was motivated to apply by a friend who had completed the course and was doing really well. I’m able to manage doing a part-time degree alongside working and family, and still have my weekends.”

Engineering Future Sustainability is a pioneering journal at the intersection of engineering and sustainable development. Recognizing the critical role that natural resources play in human commerce, daily life, and existence, we are dedicated to the cause of ensuring their longevity through sustainable engineering practices. We understand that any neglect of sustainability could risk the depletion of these resources, posing grave consequences for our world.
Our journal emphasizes the design and execution of projects that protect and conserve natural resources. We advocate for sustainable engineering practices that are not only economical but also supportive of both natural and human ecosystems. We believe that engineers have the potential to act as key players in such sustainable initiatives.
At Engineering Future Sustainability, we consider sustainable engineering to be the process of developing or managing systems that ensure the sustainable use of energy and resources. This implies utilization at a rate that neither compromises the environment nor the ability of future generations to meet their needs.
Our scope extends to all aspects of design, including structural design and temporary works, which can greatly influence the overall sustainability of a structure. We view the sustainability of a structure through multiple lenses – the embodied energy of structural materials, durability, design flexibility, optimality, and deconstruction, among others.
We take pride in providing a platform for the exchange of the latest ideas from professionals and scholars in the field. Our journal is a dynamic space that progressively illustrates the methodologies for designing a sustainable future. We champion engineering projects and products that meet current demands without endangering the future's ability to fulfill its needs.
Until now, the engineering field's contributions to sustainability have primarily focused on minimizing the negative impacts of development on the environment and improving resource use efficiency. Engineering Future Sustainability is dedicated to shifting this perspective, focusing on how to engineer sustainability for the future.
We believe that solutions, projects, and products developed to address current problems must be designed with a clear vision of their environmental impact and efficient resource use, always considering the wellbeing of future generations. To achieve this, we encourage collaboration between engineering scholars and professionals, and our journal serves as a shared platform to unite these efforts.
If you share our commitment to engineering a sustainable future, we invite you to contribute your expertise and innovative ideas to our journal. Together, we can make a significant impact and ensure the health of our environment and its inhabitants for generations to come.

What will you study?
Studying our International Dispute Resolution LLM course will equip you with specialist knowledge and skills in the areas of legal theory and international legal practice. You will be provided with a solid grounding in traditional, common law as well as EU law rules that regulate International Commercial Litigation to understand the current development and trends in the field. At the same time, you will be introduced to the fundamental principles and legal institutes of international commercial litigation. You will also develop a critical understanding of the principles and legal theories in International Commercial Arbitration by exploring its practice, the relevant laws and international treaties that govern it. In particular, you will apply this knowledge and relevant legal rules to case scenarios to gain an awareness of the contemporary challenges and developments in the field.
As a crucial skill, Settlement of International Disputes will allow you to explore the law, practice and institutional design of international courts that will enable you to effectively conduct a comparative analysis. To add to this, you will learn how different dispute settlement bodies interact, and understand its multiple functions and influences. With a critical approach, you will also consider the tensions, challenges and possible solutions in the practice of international dispute settlement. Furthermore, you will study the core principles of Investment Treaty Arbitration and learn to apply this alongside relevant legal rules to case problem scenarios. Here, you will discuss a range of issues and criticisms in the investment treaty arbitration regime, different procedures for settlement of investment disputes and the growing number of arbitral decisions in this field.
In Transnational Human Rights and Climate Change Litigation, you will gain a critical understanding of strategic human rights litigation, its role in fostering change and its potential pitfalls and ethical considerations on a national, regional and global scale. You will learn the mechanisms for the protection of human rights while critically evaluating practices in strategic human rights litigation, such as in the area of human rights-based climate change litigation. Finally, you will bring this acquired theory and practice together to complete an LLM Dissertation where you will conduct a major research project into a topic of your interest that is relevant to your field of study. Here, you will engage with various sources such as statues, treaties, regulations, policy documents and other academic literature alongside the relevant research methods to help you analyse and critically evaluate your research.
How will you be assessed?
The course as a whole, and each individual unit, are designed in such a way as to enable you to build upon the knowledge and skills that you gained during your undergraduate studies and to develop greater autonomy of learning, independent analysis and critical evaluation. Learning activities and assessment tasks are designed to foster the incremental development of your subject knowledge and transferrable skills, whilst at the same time supporting your personal and professional development.
In-class learning activities are structured around lectures, seminars and workshops. Although the nature and format of the activities will vary from unit to unit, interactive learning and practice-based activities are key to all units. In-class activities and exercises will involve a mix of group discussion, debating, individual and group presentations and moots and will provide you with the opportunity to test and consolidate your knowledge and to apply it in a variety of contexts requiring analysis, evaluation and synthesis and/or problem-solving. Alongside in-class activities, you will also be expected to engage in a range of online learning activities, including virtual workshops and seminars delivered by guest speakers, training sessions for legal databases such as Lexis Nexis, Westlaw, discussion forums and group and individual e-journals.
The opportunity to be an active participant in the learning process will improve your learning experience and increase your confidence as a future legal professional. Your contribution to your own learning, and particularly your engagement with assigned reading in advance of each session, will maximise the benefit of in-class activities and your learning experience.
Throughout the course, you will be assessed in various ways. The different types of assessments will enable you to demonstrate both breadth and depth of subject knowledge and contextual understanding, whilst at the same time developing your academic and professional skills. Assessment methods which you will encounter in the course of your LLM studies include:
- Written Report or Research Essay: these assessments will enable you to develop your knowledge, legal research and critical analysis skills. You will be required to perform literature-informed research, review and evaluate the relevant sources and use an appropriate methodology in order to analyse and evaluate the relevant concepts.
- Case Study Reports: this will require you to apply your legal knowledge in the context of a specific factual scenario, in order to provide a sound legal analysis of the options available.
- Oral Presentation: by presenting your research and arguments in a formal setting, you will develop a number of transferable skills, including in particular the ability to communicate your ideas and findings in a professional, clear and concise manner.
- Mooting: this will develop your legal research, written and oral advocacy skills, by requiring you to devise a solid and convincing legal argument and articulate and defend it during simulated proceedings.
- Dissertation: in your final project, you will be required to produce an individual, independent piece of written work, supported by high-quality legal research. You will be asked to identify the research question or problem under investigation, critically review the relevant case law and academic literature, develop a sound methodology in order to explore the problem, proceed with the analysis, discuss your findings, and, where appropriate, make recommendations. This is the final step of your LLM studies and it builds on the knowledge and skills acquired in all taught units.
The notions of accountability and academic integrity play an integral role in the course. Starting from the initial induction, and in the context of each unit, you will be given extensive training on the principles of academic integrity, how to avoid plagiarism, reference legal sources, and correctly acknowledge other peoples’ work and ideas. Specific training on the use of AI tools in an academic and professional context, with a particular focus on legal practice, will also be provided. All coursework assignments will require a thorough evaluation of the sources used and all sources will need to be fully acknowledged and referenced in accordance with the OSCOLA referencing system. In the context of individual projects and coursework, students will be expected to be able to show evidence of the different stages of preparation of the final submission and to be able to present and discuss their work in its entirety upon completion.
Careers
The course will equip you with the perspective and skills necessary for a wide range of legal careers including within international law firms - many of which have departments specialised in international dispute resolution - or as in-house counsel within international corporations.
Other potential careers include working as legal adviser to governmental and non-governmental organisations, as well as international and inter-governmental organisations, such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague; European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Strasbourg; International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Paris; London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA); International Centre for Investment Dispute Settlement (ICSID) in Washington DC; and the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague.
The course also provides an excellent pathway for further studies including postgraduate research at MPhil or PhD level.

About the Language Testing Forum
The Language Testing Forum (LTF) is an annual conference held in the United Kingdom, dedicated to the field of language testing and assessment. LTF is organized by different institutions or groups within the language testing community each year, with 2024 being hosted by CRELLA at the University of Bedfordshire. The conference serves as a platform for researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders in the language testing community to come together to discuss recent developments, share research findings, and explore practical issues related to language testing and assessment. Since 2016, LTF has been the official conference of UKALTA and features the UKALTA Annual General Meeting (AGM). The conference plays a vital role in advancing the field of language testing in the UK and promotes professional standards in language assessment.
Conference theme
The theme for LTF 2024 is 'What do we want the future of language assessment to look like?: Taking stock of what we know now'. Featured topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Equ(al)ity, Diversity, and Inclusion in language assessment
- Interfaces between language assessment and other disciplines
- Revisiting the relationship between language education and assessment in the era of Generative AI
- Test localisation
- Language policy and assessment
- Multimodal assessment
- Language assessment literacy
What makes the above so relevant? Due to a confluence of emergent technological advancements and societal developments which are transforming educational practices and raising new ethical considerations, 2024 is a pivotal time to discuss the future of language testing and assessment. The theme, ""What do we want the future of language assessment to look like? Taking stock of what we know now"", encompasses prominent interconnected issues in language assessment. The selected issues are both salient and interconnected as they collectively aim to create fair, valid, and contextually appropriate evaluation systems that leverage technological advancements, address diverse learner needs, and ensure that educators and policymakers are well-informed and equipped to implement effective practices.

Library Services: Information literacy policy
Statement of intent
UWL Library Services is committed to developing increased knowledge of critical information literacy in the academic community. As part of this we are committed to developing and embedding critical information literacy within all aspects of our professional practice, especially in our teaching across all academic levels. Our information literacy teaching will continue to involve approaches and interventions which focus on the development, enrichment and empowerment of lifelong learners and engaged citizens.
What is critical information literacy?
The critically information literate person can find, evaluate and make balanced judgements about information and use it with an awareness of the significance of its social, political and economic origins, to increase their understanding, competency, expertise, autonomy and creativity.
Learning: Critically information literate learners have the skills and tools to engage with information landscapes through an awareness of origins, significance and value. Gaining in confidence and understanding, they begin to develop a self-directed approach to their studies and become more aware of current patterns of inequality.
Teaching: Critically information literate teachers are highly aware of contemporary issues, societal power structures and knowledge in their area of expertise and therefore are better able to develop challenging, inclusive and creative teaching which recognises the need for, and supports, the development of information literacy in their students’ learning.
Research: Critically information literate researchers can evaluate and select from the research evidence landscape with an understanding of the nature, value, origins of and absences in that evidence. They are more fully engaged with current knowledge and so can effectively recognise the direction of future research and how, and in what context, they might make an impactful contribution.
In the workplace: The critically information literate person has a greater ability to grasp the origins, contexts and meaning of the relevant information landscapes whose critical evaluation and application is necessary to fulfil a range of roles in the workplace, including informing and supporting others, fulfilling key aims and developing strategy (Cheuk, 2017; Forster, 2017).
As a citizen: Critically information literate citizens can critically judge information and its sources to make ethically and socially aware decisions that enable them to engage fully in democratic life and society (Coonan et al, 2018).
The value of information literacy development for UWL
Information literacy is a key attribute in effective teaching and learning, research, workplace functionality and empowered citizenship (Bruce, 2008; Forster, 2015; Coonan et al, 2018) and maps to the University's Graduate Attributes (UWL, 2015). Its ‘critical’ form is essential for the increasing awareness of those cultural and institutional factors which influence and limit equality, diversity and inclusion.
Library Services see information literacy as part of the University’s drive to increase engagement, continuation and progression of students. Information literacy skills contribute to the student engaging with their subject knowledge, aid in their understanding, help to increase confidence and enable them to succeed in their endeavours. The skills can be understood and applied best when taught in a subject discipline.
It also contributes to a student’s understanding of academic integrity and supports them in conducting their research and studies in an ethical, honest and responsible way.
Information literacy knowledge and skills develop throughout education and into the world of work. People face an ever increasing amount of information both in their disciplines and the wider world; these lifelong learning skills give the opportunity to understand disciplines and build on the work of others to generate new and creative contributions and ideas. This is especially the case as we consider the evolving information landscape, including generative AI technology.
For information literacy skills training to be effective, recognition of a person’s current competencies and the context they are working in (level, subject etc) is a crucial starting point. As a career university, UWL needs to ensure that the skills are shown as relevant to both study and employment. The diversity of subject areas taught and researched at UWL also means that staff and students will require varied information sources, evaluation techniques and approaches. Our implementation of this information literacy policy will ensure that these factors form part of our planning and delivery.
This policy responds to the needs set out in the UWL Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategy 2018-2023 (UWL, 2018), UWL Employability Statement (2021a) and UWL Research and Scholarship Strategy (2021b), 2021-2025.
The policy also responds to the information literacy requirements of professional accrediting societies.
Integrating information literacy development interventions
Library Services works closely with the schools/colleges, IT Services, CELT and the Study Support team to ensure that there is a coordinated approach to academic skills. Information literacy should not be seen in isolation but instead integrated within the curriculum requiring close working with the module/course team. The skills learnt should help fulfil the learning objectives of the module and be as closely aligned to the subject content of the module as possible.
The method of delivery of the skills will vary across courses and be dependent on the best way to embed the skills for the subject area and engage students within the discipline. This could be a lecture/tutorial method, tutorial only, embedded video followed by Q&A session or a series of lectures and/or tutorials/labs. Information literacy should also not be seen as only relevant to students; Library Services is committed to 'teaching the teacher' and researcher to make sure that they are up to date on the relevant skills to support them in their teaching as well as in their research.
It is pivotal that all students and staff have the same opportunities to develop information literacy skills. The methods used to do this will be tailored to each subject area and level, but the policy aims to ensure equality for all.
Information literacy is a collaboration between librarians and academic staff who each bring unique knowledge and experience. Members of the library team research and publish on the role of information literacy in professional and educational settings and provide practical pedagogical knowledge about the importance of evaluating information, accessing, and synthesising content and critical reading of diverse information sources. Academic staff can provide that deep subject knowledge and the context needed to make sure that the information literacy skills are tailored correctly for students' academic and future professional needs.
Objectives
-
Campus based students will be provided with information literacy embedded into their curriculum at all levels.
-
Research students will be offered an induction at the beginning of their research studies and follow up guidance.
-
Academic staff will be offered 1-2-1 meetings and workshops to enhance their information literacy skills which will be supplemented with regular communication about other opportunities to keep abreast in this area.
-
All support/professional staff in the University will have the opportunity to develop their information literacy skills and be able to book 1-2-1 meetings with assistant librarians.
Implementation
Library Services will implement this Information Literacy policy through the following methods, all of which will take into consideration different starting points and preferences:
Induction: Students, researchers and staff will be offered an induction to the library.
Embedded interventions in modules: The subject librarian will work with the module leader to ensure that the embedded information literacy interventions in modules will be timed to ensure that they are relevant to the work that the students are completing and focused on their needs. These interventions will be synchronous or asynchronous, the former taking place in the scheduled timetable either in the lecture or workshop/studio/tutorial slot. Where possible, there will be multiple interventions in the module and formative or summative activities will be created to help embed the skills being developed.
Course development: At the development stage of a new course, through major/minor amendments or through the re-approval process, the subject librarian will work with the course team to ensure that information literacy skills are embedded into the course at the relevant levels.
Online tutorials and guides: These will be available via the library website and/or embedded into the VLE to offer students additional ways of accessing information literacy training. They will also allow students to further review material which has been covered in a class. When appropriate, they will be offered and applied as ‘Investigate’ resources within the context of the Flex pedagogy or similar pedagogies, and the subject librarian will provide appropriate support as needed. Guides will also be available to help research staff and students make the best use of information resources.
Individual appointments: All staff and students can book an appointment with their subject librarian/assistant librarian to have additional support in understanding the resource landscape and the principles and practicalities of finding and using information for their purposes.
Alumni: Alumni with a valid alumni card can also book an appointment with a member of the Academic Support team for assistance in location of relevant available information.
Monitoring the success of this policy
How information literacy development can be identified
The success of this policy will be demonstrated by students exhibiting a deeper understanding of their information landscape (Lloyd, 2010) and ability to engage with it effectively. This will be demonstrated in an increase in the range and appropriate use of information sources used in their academic work demonstrating their skills in searching, sourcing and critically evaluating sources. Potential indicators include richer and more focused reference lists and oral reference to richer and more focussed references in Q&A discussions with academic staff and fellow students. In addition, the success will be shown in a growth in student’s confidence in their knowledge of information skills, evaluation and critical thinking.
How we will monitor this
We will monitor this by examining a snapshot of students’ work (anonymously) at the beginning of their course and their final year to measure the growth in their use of information. In addition, we will measure the confidence level of students as they progress through their course.
The success will also be shown by an increase in the quantity of students and staff being taught in information literacy skills.
Report on progress to the wider University
Library Services Information Literacy group will report to the Library Management team each semester to record progress in the implementation of the policy. The group will also update the team on best practice around information literacy and recommendations for future developments.
Annually, the Library will report to the University on progress against our KPIs which includes a KPI on information literacy (Objective 1 of this policy).
Responding to Evidence and Feedback
As teaching and learning approaches change, librarians will amend their teaching of information literacy to ensure they are following best practice. These changes will be in consultation with their academic and librarian colleagues, both at UWL and in the wider profession.

What you'll study
Our programme mirrors the SQE examinations and therefore focuses on developing your legal knowledge (SQE 1) and your practical skills (SQE 2).
On our LLM SQE/Legal Practice you will be equipped with the foundational legal knowledge needed as a newly qualified solicitor. This includes knowledge of ethics and professional conduct, in addition to core areas of law such as business law, tax law, wills and the administration of estates, tort law, contract law, land law and criminal law.
In the practice focused modules you will develop your advanced legal skills. You will learn how to conduct interviewing, develop your advocacy and case analysis skills, perfect your legal writing and drafting and undertake legal research.
Through the advanced research skills module and the legal practice project you will also further develop your research and writing skills by completing an industry report, similar to a dissertation.
How you'll study
This course is designed to allow for flexible learning. Face-to-face tuition will occur at Edge Hill University every two weeks. BARBRI-delivered content is delivered online asynchronously (not in real time), allowing you to study at a convenient time for you.
BARBRI provide an AI-empowered online platform (Intuitive Study Assistant and Coach (ISAAC)), which supports your learning, helping you to keep track of content, engage with practice questions and assess your individual skills performance.
We also want you to feel supported when studying which is why BARBRI provide supervision and immediate feedback from expert tutors and offer individual online mentor support from a qualified solicitor. You will also have your very own online personal study plan and will be able to access 1:1 meetings, exam skill workshops and group strategy or consolidation sessions to help you with your learning and exam success.
In addition to the online platform you will have access to bespoke workbooks and study materials which accompany online instruction. The materials also include supplemental resources for non-law graduates.
As an Edge Hill student you will also have access to the University’s Student Support Team, Careers Team and Uniskills Team which offer specialist advice on areas such as personal wellbeing, career development and study skills. Within the School of Law and Criminal Justice, you will also benefit from our expert lecturers and will be allocated a Personal Tutor who can offer general support and guidance throughout your programme.
How you'll be assessed
Modules delivered online by BARBRI will be assessed via online multiple-choice question assessments which replicate the ‘real-life’ SQE examinations.
Modules delivered face-to-face by Edge Hill University will be assessed via a combination of coursework, practical assessments and a legal practice project essay.
To prepare you for your assessments and the SQE examinations, guidance on assessments and opportunities to put your skills and knowledge into practice will be provided throughout the duration of your programme.
Who will be teaching you
You will be taught by a combination of highly skilled Edge Hill University staff members, including practising solicitors, and trained legal professionals at BARBRI.
The academic team are actively engaged in research and legal practice, meaning all materials which are delivered are current and informed by the latest best practice in the profession.
You will also benefit from numerous extra-curricular events, including guest speakers, panel events, and insight days, which will enhance your learning experience.
Where your course includes optional modules, these are to provide an element of choice within the course curriculum. The availability of optional modules may vary from year to year and will be subject to minimum student numbers being achieved. This means that the availability of specific optional modules cannot be guaranteed. Optional module selection may also be affected by timetabling requirements. Some restrictions on optional module choice or combinations of optional modules may apply.
Your future career
Employability is embedded throughout this course, helping you to prepare not only for your SQE examinations but your future career in the legal profession.
Whilst the programme is tailored towards students wishing to pursue a career as a solicitor, the programme will provide you with a broad range of transferable skills, allowing you to embark on career opportunities in legal and non-legal sectors.
As a School we are committed to enhancing your employability and helping you to finding the right career path for you. That means career development opportunities are embedded into your programme or offered through extra-curricular activities.
We offer a wide range of extracurricular activities to enhance your skills and provide you with real-life experience; this may include: work placements, commercial awareness workshops, bespoke careers fairs, alumni panels, and guest speakers. You will also be able to participate in our numerous internal mooting and negotiation competitions, making use of our in-house Moot Court and Law Clinic, and external competitions, such as the Jessup International Law Moot, CEDR National Student Negotiation Competition and Sports Arbitration Moot.
All of these opportunities allow you to network with employers, gain real-world experience and develop your graduate attributes – the skills needed for employment.
We will also encourage you to make use of the excellent support available through our University’s Careers Team, whether that be career guidance, CV and application writing, help searching for part-time work or support when applying for graduate roles.

Guidance Notes
Under the UKVI rules students studying in the United Kingdom on a student visa, are restricted to specified working hours per week during the term-time as detailed in the individual student’s visa contained either on their Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) or their digital visa. The restrictions are usually 20 hours per week, being the seven-day period from Monday to Sunday, for Master's Degrees, Research Degrees and Bachelor's Degree .
However, during vacation periods, as detailed above, Student visa holders may be employed on a full-time basis. There are still some restrictions on the type of work that can be done at these times. Those on a Student visa who are seeking employment can never:
- be employed as a doctor in training;
- be employed as a professional sportsperson (including a sports coach);
- be employed as an entertainer;
- be self-employed;
- engage in business activity; or
- fill a full-time, permanent vacancy
International students entering the UK with a Standard Visitor Visa may not take any paid or unpaid employment.
Potential employers are strongly advised to check both the restrictions detailed in an individual student’s visa and seek guidance from the UKVI directly or via the UKVI website regarding a migrant student’s legal right to work. Employers are also advised to undertake a Right to Work check or use the Employer Checking Service available through UKVI. Our document Employing International Students from the University of Chester highlights some useful information for those employing student visa holders from the University of Chester.
Both employers and students are reminded that for the purposes of employment or working the UKVI define a 'week' as the seven-day period commencing on a Monday and ending on the following Sunday. Training also counts towards the total hours per week.

Are you fascinated by law and how it is viewed through a criminological lens? Our Qualifying Law Degree, Law with Criminology LLB (Hons), explores the foundations of law and theories of crime, providing exemptions from the academic stage of training to become a solicitor or barrister.
Overview
Our LLB (Hons) Law with Criminology degree provides an overview of legal systems and institutions with a minor specialism in criminology. It will provide you with an engaging, insightful and thorough insight into the world of law and crime, equipping you with the practical and substantive knowledge to practice law.
You’ll explore contemporary case studies and their critiques to sharpen your critical analysis skills. You’ll look at the police, criminal courts, prisons and youth justice services under the microscope, and understand the legal system as a whole – including its impact on society.
Joining our Law with Criminology programme also means that you’re embarking on an immersive learning experience, with opportunities to practise your mooting and negotiation skills in our on-campus Moot Court Room, provide legal advice to the community in our Law Clinic or act as a criminal defence lawyer in our ‘Crime House’.
You will also benefit from being taught by current and former legal practitioners and internationally recognised academics and can take advantage of our extensive industry links.
At our School, we pride ourselves on providing not only an excellent academic experience but also a supportive environment where you can thrive.

What you'll study
In the first year of law with criminology, we’ll unpack the basics. There’s an overview of legal reasoning and analysis, and you’ll take a look at the principles that regulate legally binding contracts. Hone your practical skills in our Lawyers’ Skills module or learn the fundamentals of Cyber Security. We’ll focus on criminal justice processes in crime and social justice contexts.
Explore property and land law in Year 2 of law with criminology. And decide whether to delve into administrative law as it operates in the UK or the process behind bringing a claim for judicial review. We’ll help you explore criminal law and critical criminology theory too, as well as the fundamental principles of public law. You’ll examine questions around violence. What are the various forms? And how can we understand its impact on society?
In Year 3 you’ll shape your studies by choosing from a variety of specialist areas of law. You’ll study these alongside your compulsory modules and could learn about Digital Policing and Cybercrime, Family Law, or Counter Terrorism. Perhaps you’d like to specialise in human rights, sports, the media or tax law? You’ll have the opportunity to forge the first steps to your future career path and apply practical aspects through our Law Clinic Experience module.

You will be taught by a mixture of lectures, seminars and workshops.

We apply standard admissions criteria but, more than this, we are looking for students who will contribute to and benefit from a programme of study with us. We will consider you as an individual and take into account all aspects of your application, not just your qualifications. We are looking for both breadth and depth in your current studies as well as enthusiasm for the subject you wish to study.
This information is provided as a general guide only. Entry requirements will vary for particular courses, and some have additional requirements - such as portfolios for art courses - so please check the specific course descriptions before applying.
You can check individual country pages to confirm that your local qualifications are suitable.
To apply for a place on an undergraduate course (BA/BSc) you need to have completed your high school education (12 years) and have a pass equivalent to two UK A level passes, and have the required English language qualification.
The normal entry requirements for postgraduate degrees (MA/MSc/MBA/LLM) are a UK Bachelor's degree with Honours (2:2 minimum), or equivalent (normally we will consider 50% or above in a Bachelor’s degree with Honours), in an appropriate subject from a recognised university or HE institution.
We also consider candidates with other relevant qualifications and individuals with appropriate work experience.
Some courses may require the submission of a portfolio. If this is the case, it will be outlined in your offer letter.
The portfolio is your opportunity to show us your creative skills and why you would like to join our art and design department.
Carefully select and edit a small selection of work to produce an exciting, creative and representative portfolio of your work, which informs us about your skills, interest and ambitions.
It should include a statement (max 300 words) introducing the work in your portfolio. Your statement should explain why you have chosen your discipline and where you might like to develop in your time with us.
The portfolio should contain a maximum of 15 samples of work.
This must include:
- A selection of your student projects (if relevant)
- A selection of your professional work (if relevant)
- A brief, illustrated explanation of any research you have undertaken
- Examples of preparatory creative work (for example, images from your sketchbooks)
We are unable to give individual feedback on your portfolio.

If you do use generative AI for any aspect of the research process, we'd strongly recommend reading through the page on Using AI Critically.
On this page, we'll be taking a look at search engines and highlight some issues around using generative AI when conducting a literature search.
You must follow the latest guidance on using Generative AI as provided by your School.
It's important to note, that the technology we have used and continue to use before the advent of ChatGPT was not without its problems. Conducting effective literature searching online has always been an important skill to develop, and it requires a good understanding of how search engines function. An effective, high quality literature search requires an understanding of the various operators and how to use them in your search. Some aspects of the process, however, remain a mystery. For example, does the user really know how relevance ranking actually works? Why one article is rated as more ""relevant"" than another?
In her book, Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Noble explores how search engines reinforce racism in their outputs. She argues:
""Search does not merely present pages but structures knowledge, and the results retrieved in a commercial search engine create their own particular material reality. Ranking is itself information that also reflects the political, social, and cultural values of the society that search engines operate within...""
Noble S. U. (2018). Algorithms of oppression : how search engines reinforce racism. New York University Press.
Search engines do not exist outside of society, they are a product of our society and, therefore, they are susceptible to all the same biases and cultural values of the society in which they exist. Search engines are not neutral. And neither is generative AI.
In a letter to the editor of Accountability in Research, Haman and Školník (2023) outlined issues they encountered when using ChatGPT for literature searching:
We used ChatGPT on 23 February 2023. ChatGPT was given the prompt: “‘List 10 seminal academic articles in the field of medicine and provide the DOI.” We used this prompt five times, resulting in five unique chats. ChatGPT provided us with 10 publications each time, for 48 unique publications from the five attempts. We found that only 8 of the 50 provided DOIs exist and are listed for the correct publication. At the same time, we searched for the title of the paper itself with the authors and the correct academic publication (even though the DOI may have been wrong), and only in 17 out of 50 cases did the article in question exist in the databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, Semantic Scholar). In 66% of the cases, ChatGPT gave us a non-existent paper.
Haman, M., & Školník, M. (2023). Using ChatGPT to conduct a literature review. Accountability in Research, 1–3. 
As with all other resources, it's important to verify the information provided to ensure it's accurate. This is particularly true of generative AI tools as they have a tendency to ""create"" references that actually don't exist. If you do use ChatGPT or similar to generate suggested articles, there are some crucial steps to take to verify what is suggested.
Request and check the DOI - when entering a prompt, request that the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for each article is provided. A DOI is a unique identifier for a journal article, and is applied to all articles that are published. When provided with the search results, cross check the DOI using the link resolver at .
Use a search engine to check the article title - Copy and paste the article title into a search engine to ensure it actually exists. Enclose the title in speech marks to ensure it searches for the specific article title rather than the words in the title (eg ""The Role of Media Literacy in the Governance of Fake News: A Pedagogical Approach"").
Check the details of the article - Ensure the journal name, authors and other details all match what has been provided.
Read the article - There is no substitute for reading the article itself! Always read the article to ensure it meets the criteria you set out in your query, do not assume that the AI has accurately interpreted your query and the articles it's found.
Keeping in mind all the limitations and issues with generative AI, there are some ways it can be useful to support you in your literature searching.
Developing A Search Strategy - A tool like goblin.tools can provide you with a structure to help you plan your literature search. Simply enter a prompt like ""Create an effective literature searching strategy"" and it will create a step-by-step guide to conducting an effective literature search strategy.
Identify Key Databases - If you're not sure where to search to find the articles you need, a prompt on ChatGPT such as ""I need to do a search on psychology and information literacy. What would be the best research databases to search?"" will provide a list of relevant databases to focus your searching.
Identifying Useful Keywords - If you are struggling to come up with search terms for your research area, you can ask a tool like ChatGPT to suggest some suitable keywords. For example, entering a prompt such as ""Provide suggested search terms for a literature search on artificial intelligence, information literacy and disinformation"" may be helpful in coming up with terms you'd not considered when developing your search strategy.
There are a range of generative AI tools out there that can help with the literature searching process, but again, we'd recommend using specialised databases and LibrarySearch as they provide authority and coverage that generative AI lacks.
Please note: we do not provide tutorials on any of the following tools.
Elicit is one of the more widely known tools for literature searching. Featuring a free trial version and a paid version ($10 per month at the time of writing), Elicit enables a fairly sophisticated search engine that provides useful summaries of papers and enables users to upload and ask questions about academic papers. Using the Semantic Scholar database, it provides access to 125 million academic papers (but not all academic papers!).
If you are interested in using Elicit, the video below provides some useful tips to get you started.
Consensus is another popular AI based search engine that uses the Semantic Scholar database to provide search results. Unlike Elicit, Consensus offers a free model which enables unlimited searches and unlimited AI-powered filters. It's also possible to integrate Consensus with ChatGPT (see here for more details).
The video below provides a brief introduction to the search engine.
ResearchRabbit is a free ""literature mapping"" tool (sign-up required) that enables you to explore the research landscape and suggests relevant articles. By adding papers to the engine, it can help connect you to other relevant papers and helps you to explore citations. You can find a brief demo of ResearchRabbit below.

We apply standard admissions criteria but, more than this, we are looking for students who will contribute to and benefit from a programme of study with us. We will consider you as an individual and take into account all aspects of your application, not just your qualifications. We are looking for both breadth and depth in your current studies as well as enthusiasm for the subject you wish to study.
This information is provided as a general guide only. Entry requirements will vary for particular courses, and some have additional requirements - such as portfolios for art courses - so please check the specific course descriptions before applying.
You can check individual country pages to confirm that your local qualifications are suitable.
To apply for a place on an undergraduate course (BA/BSc) you need to have completed your high school education (12 years) and have a pass equivalent to two UK A level passes, and have the required English language qualification.
The normal entry requirements for postgraduate degrees (MA/MSc/MBA/LLM) are a UK Bachelor's degree with Honours (2:2 minimum), or equivalent (normally we will consider 50% or above in a Bachelor’s degree with Honours), in an appropriate subject from a recognised university or HE institution.
We also consider candidates with other relevant qualifications and individuals with appropriate work experience.
Some courses may require the submission of a portfolio. If this is the case, it will be outlined in your offer letter.
The portfolio is your opportunity to show us your creative skills and why you would like to join our art and design department.
Carefully select and edit a small selection of work to produce an exciting, creative and representative portfolio of your work, which informs us about your skills, interest and ambitions.
It should include a statement (max 300 words) introducing the work in your portfolio. Your statement should explain why you have chosen your discipline and where you might like to develop in your time with us.
The portfolio should contain a maximum of 15 samples of work.
This must include:
- A selection of your student projects (if relevant)
- A selection of your professional work (if relevant)
- A brief, illustrated explanation of any research you have undertaken
- Examples of preparatory creative work (for example, images from your sketchbooks)
We are unable to give individual feedback on your portfolio.

Certain courses may require students to use AI-generated content for certain assignments. In these cases, it will always be explicitly stated in the assignment brief that you may use AI, and the brief will give guidance on how to write a proper declaration and acknowledgment of your use of AI.
Using AI to aid your work
As stated above, generative AIs should be considered as tools supporting research, rather than as places to do research in themselves. For example, you may want to ask for guidance on how to structure an assignment; for feedback on a piece of writing; for clarification or simplification of a complex text; for ideas to “get the ball rolling” on a project or for transcription of spoken word audio or descriptions of images. There are myriad ways AI may be a useful supporting tool, but the important thing to remember is not to use it to “take shortcuts”; if you are using AI to skip reading or to avoid doing work you are finding difficult, then it may not be helping you build the skills and knowledge you need to succeed on your course.
Using AI as a source of information
Please be aware that, as stated above, generative AIs are not considered a legitimate source of information or data. You should not reference or cite them directly unless the brief specifically instructs you to do so. If you use Generative AI to aid you in producing any part of your assessed work, it is your responsibility to cross-reference any information generated by the AI against legitimate sources (e.g. journals, books, online databases, published reports) to make sure that the information you give is up-to-date and accurate. Generative AI often gives convincing, but factually incorrect answers, and should not be depended on for conducting academic research.
It is fundamental to good academic research that you read all your sources yourself, and reference them according to the USW guidelines. USW’s Library and Study Skills teams have a number of resources and workshops to help you understand how to use, evaluate, and reference sources.
Privacy, security, and confidentiality
AIs are not considered a secure platform, and you should not enter any personal or confidential information into an AI system.
Whilst AIs can be powerful learning aids, they should always be thought of as something to support the research and reading you do by yourself, rather than as somewhere to actually do research. AIs are not considered a legitimate source of information or data for various reasons;
They are usually not able to produce up to date information (for example, ChatGPT is trained only material up to 2021, and cannot give information on anything after that date).
They are not intended to give factually accurate information and often produce convincing, but inaccurate information.
They may not have access to information which is behind a paywall (including a large number of academic articles), and therefore often give quite generalised information (on the level of Wikipedia) rather than the kind of specific, peer-reviewed evidence required for good academic research.
They may reproduce the biases (e.g. sexism, racism) of their training material. Moreover, most AIs were trained on English-language material from US or Western contexts and are extremely limited in terms of their ability to provide reliable information from outside those contexts.
They are programmed to strictly avoid discussion of sensitive issues (e.g. religion, drugs, politics) and may not be able to offer appropriately nuanced or in-depth information on such topics.
AI’s are only trained on existing knowledge, and are less able to produce the kind of novel and original insights which are expected of academic work.",1169,56.5,University of South Wales,16.0,11.8,15780,1169,southwales.ac.uk,18.3,283:12,,77.2,United Kingdom,"policy, administrative communications",4.379597883295788,0.4811320754716981,640,False,1169

At Bedfordshire, we offer a range of qualifications to suit the needs of our diverse student population. For undergraduate students, our options are either Honours degrees with additions such as a foundation year, or stand-alone qualifications, often with a strong workplace-based focus, such as HTQs and Foundation degrees. At postgraduate level, we offer taught courses or research-based degrees, with some workplace-based options.
Undergraduate qualifications at Bedfordshire
Also known as a Batchelor’s degree, this traditional qualification involves three years’ full-time study, with many courses offering a part-time option. This increases to four years if you also do a year's work placement or complete a Foundation Year.
At the University of Bedfordshire, we award the following Honours degrees:
- BA Honours (Bachelor of Arts)
- BEng Honours (Bachelor of Engineering)
- BSc Honours (Bachelor of Science)
- LLB Honours (Bachelor of Law)
If you are a full-time student, you are expected to complete 120 academic credits of study each year (four 30-credit modules). Part-time students normally study 60 credits each year.
A degree with a Professional Practice Year (often called a 'sandwich year' degree) takes four years. The third year is spent in a year-long work placement to ensure you have all the experience you need to enter the workplace.
This is an integrated four-year degree, with the Foundation Year as a key part of the course. You will need to complete the Foundation Year successfully to progress to the first year of your Bachelor’s degree.
The University of Bedfordshire works with a broad range of local, regional and national employers – both private and public sector – to help deliver our apprenticeship programmes. Our apprenticeship opportunities include administration and management; marketing; digital technology; nursing and midwifery; healthcare; and social work. If you are working in any of these fields, it may be worthwhile approaching your employer about an apprenticeship. All employers can take advantage of the apprenticeships' landscape.
Different to degrees with a Foundation Year, Foundation degrees are designed in association with employers to provide a more occupationally based route through higher education. The emphasis is on work-focused learning. They are normally completed over two years full time or two and a half to four years part time; FD courses are delivered at the University and also at some of our partner colleges. They are the equivalent to two-thirds of a Bachelor's degree.
After successfully completing a Foundation degree, there is often the opportunity for advanced entry onto the final year of an associated Bachelor's course. It may also be possible for those with HND, HNC, DipHE or CertHE qualifications to apply for advanced entry.
Higher Technical Qualifications (HTQs) are specialist Level 4 and 5 qualifications for students seeking a practical, employer-led route into employment. They have been developed in partnership with industry so you get the practical training and technical know-how you need to step into your chosen career, retrain or progress on in higher education.
""I spent 10 years working with the homeless and wanted to progress with the social aspect of that. I looked into courses and the Foundation Year was something that gave me access to the full social science course.""
Tim Wright, Foundation Year student
Postgraduate qualifications at Bedfordshire
The University offers a selection of taught awards:
- Master of Arts (MA), normally awarded for a course in an arts subject
- Master of Science (MSc), usually awarded for a course in a science or technology discipline
- Master of Business Administration (MBA), for those specialising in business subjects
- LLM, which is a Master’s in Law
If you are a UK or EU student with settled/pre-settled status, we have a small number of courses that are available by distance learning with online support. There is no attendance requirement, which is ideal if you have other work or family commitments.
A research degree – or Master's by Research - is an independent, advanced study programme supervised by academic staff and lasting between one and seven years, giving you an opportunity to explore more deeply a topic of your choice. Across our 10 research institutes here at Bedfordshire, we have around 275 research students conducting their own unique research, and producing new knowledge and expertise that is innovative, relevant and enlightened. They are studying towards one of the following awards:
- Master of Arts by Research (MA by Research)
- Master of Science by Research (MSc by Research)
- Master of Philosophy (MPhil)
- Master of Professional Studies (MProf)
- PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) – an advanced-level academic course involving the submission of a thesis which is original academic research in a chosen field of study
- Professional Doctorates – practice-based research degrees
- Postgraduate Certificate (PgCert) is awarded after completing 60 credits of a Master’s degree
- Postgraduate Diploma (PgDip) is awarded after completing 120 credits towards a Master’s degree
Once you have completed your PgDip, you have the option to ‘top up’ your credits by completing your Master’s.
Gaining this qualification is the most established way of undertaking initial teacher training leading to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). At Bedfordshire, we have a long-established history of teacher training, offering a wide range of PGCE routes into teaching and successful partnerships with over 500 schools and other education organisations.
We currently offer PGCE courses in:
- Primary Early Years (3-7)
- Primary Education (5-11)
- Secondary Art & Design
- Secondary Computing
- Secondary Design & Technology
- Secondary Drama
- Secondary English
- Secondary Geography
- Secondary History
- Secondary Mathematics
- Secondary Physical Education
- Secondary Science with Biology
- Secondary Science with Chemistry
- Secondary Science with Physics
""I had heard fantastic things about the PGCE course at Bedfordshire. You do four days in your placement school then come to the Uni on Friday so you have that debrief at the end of the week.""

Simply put Generative AI helps you to create a new item of media such as an image or text. Presenting the output of a Generative AI tool as your own would be a break in academic honesty, as you have not been part of the creation of that item and so are not evidencing your own learning.
You can use these tools to support your learning process but do be careful to use them correctly. Consider how much of the output is originally your own work or that of the AI tool.
ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Text model) is an example of AI designed to converse with humans. ChatGPT is an example of a Large Language Model (LLM) which has been trained on the internet to respond to input. The model is not able to select fact from fiction and simply places the next most common word after one another, similar to that of a phones suggestion of which word you would like next.

We're so pleased you’d like to join us at Beds and become part of our vibrant, diverse student community. We have an excellent reputation for preparing students for employment so your bright future starts here.
We want you to have a smooth application journey so we've made it as straightforward as possible – and our Admissions team are on hand if you have any queries.
If you know what course/s you wish to apply for, it's a good idea to refer to the individual course description for any specific application guidance as well as reading the information in this section.
Whether you apply via UCAS, the Department for Education or directly, you will have to provide references. Find out more about providing your references
For UK students, the normal application route for full-time study is online via the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS).
- If you are in full-time education, your school or college will help you register with UCAS and make your application; it will also supply your reference
- If you are returning to learning after a break or you are a mature student (over 21), you apply independently through UCAS and find your own referee
- If you are a mature student but still have contact with your old school/college, you can ask them if they will support your application and be your referee
Find out more about providing your reference
Every course has its own UCAS course code; if your chosen course doesn’t have one yet, it is likely to be because it is a new course still awaiting its code. In these cases, please contact our Admissions team at admission@
Information and payment required
The UCAS application form allows you to choose up to five courses; to add University of Bedfordshire courses, it’s useful to have to hand the UCAS code for your course and our UCAS codes – you’ll find these at the base of the page. The form will also need relevant personal details, education and employment history, and a personal statement, written by you - all of which can take some time to gather together. UCAS offers information about completing your application; our tips on writing your personal statement and jargon buster [PDF] will also build your confidence.
The final section to fill in is payment. If you are applying through a school that has an alternative payment arrangement with UCAS, you will not see the payment screen. Otherwise, you pay the application fee online using a credit or debit card. For the 2024 applicant cycle, there is a flat fee of £27.50 for up to five course choices; for 2025 entry, the fee is £28.50 for up to five choices. For the 2025 cycle, the fee may be waived if you have been in receipt of free school meals at some point during your secondary education.
After applying, it’s possible you will be invited for an interview. If you have any dates you already know of when you won’t be available for interview, it’s an idea to include them on your UCAS application.
Timings and deadlines
Once your application is completed, either you or your school will send it electronically to UCAS, who process it and send a copy to your chosen universities and colleges. We expect to receive most UCAS applications from early/mid September to mid/late January for courses starting in the following academic year. Applications received after the January deadline are considered late applications but you can still contact Admissions at admission@ to see if we have places available for your preferred course.
Deadlines change slightly every year. Please check out the application timetable for your year of entry at . Download our Key Dates calendar [PDF] and personalise it with your entry-year deadlines.
If you have problems applying online to UCAS, please contact the UCAS Customer Service team on 0371 468 0468 (Mon-Fri, 8.30am-6pm). You can also reach them via a direct message on Facebook (ucasonline) or X (@ucas_online).
Clearing starts at the beginning of July and normally continues to the end of September.
There are a number of reasons why you might ‘go into Clearing’. For college leavers, it might be that results’ day didn’t bring the grades needed. You may have changed your mind about the subject you want to study. Or you could have only just decided that you’d like to go to uni. Whatever led you there, you can find the perfect course through Clearing.
If you are applying to the University of Bedfordshire during Clearing, check out our applicants’ guide to Clearing, which takes you step by step through the process.
Most part-time courses do not have specific application deadlines. Once you have chosen your part-time course, you apply directly to the University of Bedfordshire via our online admissions portal, accessed from the relevant course page on our website. This also applies if you are looking for a part-time place during Clearing. However, for main cycle (non-Clearing) applications, we advise you to apply at least 30 days before the course starts to allow us time to process your application.
We offer around 130 Master’s (MA/MSc/LLM) and professional courses (MProf) at the University of Bedfordshire as well as research degrees (MA/MSc by Research/MPhil/PhD) affiliated to one of our 10 research institutes. Many courses offer part-time options and multiple start times to make studying easier to fit around life and work.
Postgraduate taught courses
Once you have chosen your course, you should apply via our online application portal, accessed directly from our website course pages. Most postgraduate courses do not have specific application deadlines but we advise you to apply at least 30 days before the course starts to allow us time to process your application.
There are some courses that require students to apply via UCAS or the Department for Education; in these cases, it is flagged up on both the prospectus and website course descriptions.
Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE)
All applications for a PGCE course should be made online through the Department for Education Teaching Training portal. You can make up to four choices from late October. Our Admissions team will assess your application as quickly as possible, your DfE record will be updated and you will also receive an email detailing the decision.
Research degrees
Research degree applications are managed by the Research Graduate School. You should email the Research Graduate School and you will then be advised on the application process relevant to your subject area. Once your application is received, it will be considered by the relevant research institute.
Full-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses: apply through UCAS, following the guidance given under Applying for full-time undergraduate courses.
Part-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses: once you have chosen your part-time course, you can apply directly to the University of Bedfordshire via our online admissions portal, accessed from the course page on our website.
Continuing professional development for registered healthcare practitioners: apply for degree- and Master’s-level top-up studies or a range of short courses through our NHS Business Unit at nhs-business-unit@ or via the switchboard on (0)1234 400 400.
“I was motivated to apply by a friend who had completed the course and was doing really well. I’m able to manage doing a part-time degree alongside working and family, and still have my weekends.”

Overview
The emergence of generative artificial intelligence has accelerated the need to design assessments that are authentic to the skills and knowledge required by students for their future careers and employment. Authentic assessments should aim to develop and allow students to demonstrate critical thinking, complex problem solving and innovation. Real world contexts and tasks are often open-ended, ambiguous and unpredictable and authentic assessment should try to replicate this.
Authentic assessments should support:
- Employability and discipline-specific skills and knowledge through the use of real world tasks,
- Enhanced academic integrity by requiring work that is harder to replicate with artificial intelligence,
- Greater student engagement through making tasks more relevant to students and giving students greater autonomy.
Authentic Assessments Principles
Certain assessment types are considered more authentic than other assessment types. Exams and essays, for example, are not the kinds of tasks required in the real world. Examples that might be considered more authentic include portfolios, projects, writing for a trade magazine, presentations, case studies etc. However, whilst some assessment types can be more authentic than others, it is the exact nature of the tasks which is more important.
Some basic principles to consider when designing authentic assessments include:
- Specific (not generic) questions or tasks. For example, case studies on a specific organisation or analysis of a specific context.
- Open-ended problem-based tasks.
- Tasks that require the collection of primary data.
- Tasks that require students to reflect or draw from their own experiences.
- Tasks that give students choice over what they do and how they do it. For example, they choose the specific case to study or the format of their work.
- Tasks with multiple possible answers where there is no ‘right’ answer.
- Tasks which require higher level cognitive skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving.
Authentic Assessment Auditing
The following questions could help to audit your assessments to judge whether they are authentic (University of Sussex, no date):
- Are my assessment tasks integrated with situations that reflect real-world scenarios?
- Are my assessment outcomes recognised as authentic by both students and employers?
- Do assessments challenge students to engage in problem-solving?
- Do my assessment tasks provide the opportunity for students to examine the task from different perspectives, using a variety of resources?
- Do my assessments challenge students to creatively apply their knowledge to novel contexts?
- Do my assessment tasks provide the opportunity to collaborate?
- Do my assessment tasks allow competing solutions and diversity of outcomes?
- Do my assessment tasks provide the opportunity to engage in critical reflection and self-evaluation?

Artificial Intelligence (AI)
What is AI?
AI stands for Artificial Intelligence.
In recent months there has been an explosion in different AI tools, such as ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Microsoft Copilot and Google Bard and more keep appearing.
Understanding how to use an AI tool for assignments and in the workplace means you are using and demonstrating your evaluation skills, valuable tools that employers expect to see.
You ask the tool a question and the tool trawls through the internet and other web-based collections of data such Reddit and Wikipedia to find “answers.”
Content is created by predicting the next most likely word based on the previous words, phrases it’s already found and the question you asked.
It then puts this data together in a statement that responds to the question you posed.
What can't AI do?
AI cannot:
- Understand what the words mean or the context of the statements.
- Assess the accuracy of the content as it is predicting words.
- Use the human skills of evaluation, review, and critical appraisal.
- Write in your style or use your voice.
- Always provide current, up to date information.
- Check whether the data is correct, objective, controversial, unbiased, and inclusive.
- Reference in the style you are expected to use in assignments.
- Check if the citations it provides are correct as it is predicting text, not trawling for suitable and appropriate references to articles or books.
It is your voice, your abilities to manage and interpret data, your literacy skills that you need to demonstrate in assignments and that employers want to see in your chosen graduate profession.
Can AI be detected in assignments?
Yes, Turnitin can detect and provide an overall percentage of how much text has been AI generated.
If AI text is generated and then included in an assignment as your own work, it would be considered under the university Academic Integrity Policy as work produced by a third party, and you may be asked to take part in a Viva to explain the score.
Cutting and pasting all or some of the content created by the AI used and not citing could be considered plagiarism.
Equally your tutor marking your assignment may have concerns that AI has been used to create the assignment. Triggers could be:
- The tone and vocabulary used is different to what you’ve used before.
- There are spelling and grammar errors.
- Different tenses are used.
- There isn’t any analysis, just description or a repeat of the question.
- There isn’t a logical flow in the structure of the assignment.
- The question isn’t answered in terms of currency of content or use of examples (not providing UK examples).
- References aren’t genuine and available.
Can I use AI in my assignment?
Firstly, check whether you are allowed to use AI in assignments and your course, the assignment brief and your tutors will be able to advise.
Think about AI as a tool to help with your assignment, not create your assignment.
The help could be:
- Identify ideas and concepts to research further.
- Read around a subject.
- Suggest images, visuals, and graphs (remember to cite correctly).
- Planning your assignment, the structure, conducting a literature search, etc.
BUT the content it pulls together may be false and inaccurate. Just like with Wikipedia you cannot just accept it. You need to use your information literacy and evaluation skills to check and review what the tool is telling you.
Within the library collection there are more reliable scholarly resources such as Credo to check facts and get concepts and ideas.
The Skills for Success open access guidance can help with essay planning, interpreting graphs etc.
If you do use AI as a help tool, you will need to reference it in your assignment.
How to acknowledge and reference your use of AI in your assignment
Cite Them Right gives the format your citation needs to be in (link to referencing pages), but please check with your tutors on the referencing style you should be using.
Login to Cite Them Right from the Referencing pages and go to the Digital & Internet section -> Software -> Generative AI (University log in required).
The citation gives an example of how to create the intext citation and the reference list.
Best practice is to save a transcript, or a screen shot of the question you posed and the answer you got and add to your assignment as an appendix.
Because AI is organic and ever growing, you cannot repeat the questions and get the same answer. A transcript will show your tutors how you used AI at the time of asking.",1022,25.6,University of Bedfordshire,29.1,14.3,13545,1022,beds.ac.uk,17.5,343:12,,83.9,United Kingdom,"policy, administrative communications",4.460339583469273,0.5,862,False,1022

Staff networks
The main aims that we want our staff networks to achieve are to:
- provide a safe space for discussion
- help to raise awareness, share ideas, knowledge, situations and lessons
- provide a source of support for individual staff who may be facing challenges
- be a powerful voice and source of positive change, embedded across the whole university.
Our networks provide a source of support for individual staff who may be facing challenges but they also provide opportunity for conversation with friendly colleagues who can empathise with their experiences and provide practical advice and support. Each staff network is run by its members and they all work slightly differently with a range of events, meetings and learning opportunities. By joining a network you can make a difference to the working lives of everyone at the University.
Line Managers should be supportive of their staff joining staff networks – they are an integral part of our University community. If you have any concerns or are experiencing any problems in joining a staff network do contact us.
We welcome and support the creation of new staff networks, as the networks are self-run we cannot launch these ourselves but we can offer support and guidance in setting a network up. If you wish to join any of these staff networks, or would like to have a discussion about creating one, please email Staff Wellbeing and Development.

We apply standard admissions criteria but, more than this, we are looking for students who will contribute to and benefit from a programme of study with us. We will consider you as an individual and take into account all aspects of your application, not just your qualifications. We are looking for both breadth and depth in your current studies as well as enthusiasm for the subject you wish to study.
This information is provided as a general guide only. Entry requirements will vary for particular courses, and some have additional requirements - such as portfolios for art courses - so please check the specific course descriptions before applying.
You can check individual country pages to confirm that your local qualifications are suitable.
To apply for a place on an undergraduate course (BA/BSc) you need to have completed your high school education (12 years) and have a pass equivalent to two UK A level passes, and have the required English language qualification.
The normal entry requirements for postgraduate degrees (MA/MSc/MBA/LLM) are a UK Bachelor's degree with Honours (2:2 minimum), or equivalent (normally we will consider 50% or above in a Bachelor’s degree with Honours), in an appropriate subject from a recognised university or HE institution.
We also consider candidates with other relevant qualifications and individuals with appropriate work experience.
Some courses may require the submission of a portfolio. If this is the case, it will be outlined in your offer letter.
The portfolio is your opportunity to show us your creative skills and why you would like to join our art and design department.
Carefully select and edit a small selection of work to produce an exciting, creative and representative portfolio of your work, which informs us about your skills, interest and ambitions.
It should include a statement (max 300 words) introducing the work in your portfolio. Your statement should explain why you have chosen your discipline and where you might like to develop in your time with us.
The portfolio should contain a maximum of 15 samples of work.
This must include:
- A selection of your student projects (if relevant)
- A selection of your professional work (if relevant)
- A brief, illustrated explanation of any research you have undertaken
- Examples of preparatory creative work (for example, images from your sketchbooks)
We are unable to give individual feedback on your portfolio.

We're so pleased you’d like to join us at Beds and become part of our vibrant, diverse student community. We have an excellent reputation for preparing students for employment so your bright future starts here.
We want you to have a smooth application journey so we've made it as straightforward as possible – and our Admissions team are on hand if you have any queries.
If you know what course/s you wish to apply for, it's a good idea to refer to the individual course description for any specific application guidance as well as reading the information in this section.
Whether you apply via UCAS, the Department for Education or directly, you will have to provide references. Find out more about providing your references
For UK students, the normal application route for full-time study is online via the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS).
- If you are in full-time education, your school or college will help you register with UCAS and make your application; it will also supply your reference
- If you are returning to learning after a break or you are a mature student (over 21), you apply independently through UCAS and find your own referee
- If you are a mature student but still have contact with your old school/college, you can ask them if they will support your application and be your referee
Find out more about providing your reference
Every course has its own UCAS course code; if your chosen course doesn’t have one yet, it is likely to be because it is a new course still awaiting its code. In these cases, please contact our Admissions team at admission@
Information and payment required
The UCAS application form allows you to choose up to five courses; to add University of Bedfordshire courses, it’s useful to have to hand the UCAS code for your course and our UCAS codes – you’ll find these at the base of the page. The form will also need relevant personal details, education and employment history, and a personal statement, written by you - all of which can take some time to gather together. UCAS offers information about completing your application; our tips on writing your personal statement and jargon buster [PDF] will also build your confidence.
The final section to fill in is payment. If you are applying through a school that has an alternative payment arrangement with UCAS, you will not see the payment screen. Otherwise, you pay the application fee online using a credit or debit card. For the 2024 applicant cycle, there is a flat fee of £27.50 for up to five course choices; for 2025 entry, the fee is £28.50 for up to five choices. For the 2025 cycle, the fee may be waived if you have been in receipt of free school meals at some point during your secondary education.
After applying, it’s possible you will be invited for an interview. If you have any dates you already know of when you won’t be available for interview, it’s an idea to include them on your UCAS application.
Timings and deadlines
Once your application is completed, either you or your school will send it electronically to UCAS, who process it and send a copy to your chosen universities and colleges. We expect to receive most UCAS applications from early/mid September to mid/late January for courses starting in the following academic year. Applications received after the January deadline are considered late applications but you can still contact Admissions at admission@ to see if we have places available for your preferred course.
Deadlines change slightly every year. Please check out the application timetable for your year of entry at . Download our Key Dates calendar [PDF] and personalise it with your entry-year deadlines.
If you have problems applying online to UCAS, please contact the UCAS Customer Service team on 0371 468 0468 (Mon-Fri, 8.30am-6pm). You can also reach them via a direct message on Facebook (ucasonline) or X (@ucas_online).
Clearing starts at the beginning of July and normally continues to the end of September.
There are a number of reasons why you might ‘go into Clearing’. For college leavers, it might be that results’ day didn’t bring the grades needed. You may have changed your mind about the subject you want to study. Or you could have only just decided that you’d like to go to uni. Whatever led you there, you can find the perfect course through Clearing.
If you are applying to the University of Bedfordshire during Clearing, check out our applicants’ guide to Clearing, which takes you step by step through the process.
Most part-time courses do not have specific application deadlines. Once you have chosen your part-time course, you apply directly to the University of Bedfordshire via our online admissions portal, accessed from the relevant course page on our website. This also applies if you are looking for a part-time place during Clearing. However, for main cycle (non-Clearing) applications, we advise you to apply at least 30 days before the course starts to allow us time to process your application.
We offer around 130 Master’s (MA/MSc/LLM) and professional courses (MProf) at the University of Bedfordshire as well as research degrees (MA/MSc by Research/MPhil/PhD) affiliated to one of our 10 research institutes. Many courses offer part-time options and multiple start times to make studying easier to fit around life and work.
Postgraduate taught courses
Once you have chosen your course, you should apply via our online application portal, accessed directly from our website course pages. Most postgraduate courses do not have specific application deadlines but we advise you to apply at least 30 days before the course starts to allow us time to process your application.
There are some courses that require students to apply via UCAS or the Department for Education; in these cases, it is flagged up on both the prospectus and website course descriptions.
Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE)
All applications for a PGCE course should be made online through the Department for Education Teaching Training portal. You can make up to four choices from late October. Our Admissions team will assess your application as quickly as possible, your DfE record will be updated and you will also receive an email detailing the decision.
Research degrees
Research degree applications are managed by the Research Graduate School. You should email the Research Graduate School and you will then be advised on the application process relevant to your subject area. Once your application is received, it will be considered by the relevant research institute.
Full-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses: apply through UCAS, following the guidance given under Applying for full-time undergraduate courses.
Part-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses: once you have chosen your part-time course, you can apply directly to the University of Bedfordshire via our online admissions portal, accessed from the course page on our website.
Continuing professional development for registered healthcare practitioners: apply for degree- and Master’s-level top-up studies or a range of short courses through our NHS Business Unit at nhs-business-unit@ or via the switchboard on (0)1234 400 400.
“I was motivated to apply by a friend who had completed the course and was doing really well. I’m able to manage doing a part-time degree alongside working and family, and still have my weekends.”

Artificial Intelligence (AI) – a branch of computer science dealing with the ability of computers to simulate intelligent human behaviour.
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) – the theoretical ability for computers to simulate general human intelligence, including the ability to think, reason, perceive, infer, hypothesise, but with fewer errors. This is not yet reality, but is the goal of many large AI research enterprises.
Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) – the ability of a computer to simulate human intelligence when focused on a particular task. A well-known example of this is the development of chess-playing computers, which beat the best human players in the early 2000s and are now accepted as training tools available on any smartphone.
Bias – Any pre-learned attitude or preference that affects a person’s response to another person, thing or idea. In the context of GenAI it commonly refers to a chatbot’s reflection of bias present in its training data (namely, the internet) in its responses to users’ queries.
Big data – an accumulation of a data set so large that it cannot be processed or manipulated by traditional data management tools. It can also refer to the systems and tools developed to manage such large data sets.
Data mining – the practice and process of analysing large amounts of data to find new information, such as patterns or trends.
Data tagging – a process in data classification and categorisation, in which digital ‘tags’ are added to data containing metadata. In the context of GenAI, training data for Large Language Models is tagged by humans so the AI can learn whether to include or exclude it from its responses. This may be to comply with legal requirements, or ethical and moral codes.
Deep learning – a subset of machine learning that works with unstructured data and, through a process of self-correction, adjusts its outputs to increase its accuracy at a given task. In the context of AI, this process is closely related to reinforcement learning.
Generative Artificial Intelligence – Generates new content from existing data in response to prompts entered by a user. It doesn’t copy from an original source, but rather paraphrases text or remixes images and produces new content. It learns via unsupervised training on big data sets, but does not reason or think for itself.
Hallucination – Answers from GenAI chatbots that sound plausible, but are untrue, or based on unsound reasoning. It is thought that hallucinations occur due to inconsistencies and bias in training data, ambiguity in natural language prompts, an inability to verify information, or lack of contextual understanding.
Large Language Model (LLM) – A specific type of GenAI that specialises in producing natural language. Chatbots such as Gemini, Copilot and GPT-4 are examples of LLMs.
Machine Learning – The capacity of computers to adapt and improve their performance at a task, without explicit instructions, by incorporating new data into an existing statistical model.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) – The analysis of natural language by a computer. It is a field of computer science that takes computational linguistics and combines it with machine and deep learning models to allow computers to understand text and speech, and respond accordingly. Voice activated “smart” technologies and translation software are two of many everyday uses for NLP.
Neural networks – a computing architecture, or machine learning technique, where a number of processors are interconnected in a manner inspired by the arrangement of human neurons; they can learn through a process of trial and error.
Pattern recognition – a data analysis method that uses machine learning to recognize patterns, or regularities, in big data.
Plug-in – a small piece of software that enhances the ability a larger system or application to fulfil a specific task, e.g. a referencing plug-in on a web browser can pull the metadata from a webpage into a reference management system to create a bibliographic entry.
Recurrent neural networks (RNN) – a neural network that is trained to “remember” past data to predict what should come next. It is used for ordinal tasks, such as language translation and natural language processing, as language is sequential arrangement of letters to create meaning.
Reinforcement learning – a process whereby a deep learning model learns to become more accurate at a specific task based on feedback. The process by which it improves its accuracy is called backpropagation.
Supervised learning – a machine learning method where the model is trained using data that has been labelled by a human, i.e. training using examples. This is useful for predicting future outcomes based on past trends where data already exists.
Turing Test – a ‘test’ devised by British computer scientist Alan Turing to distinguish if a computer was “intelligent”. He posited that a human interrogator must ask questions over a fixed period of time to both a computer and a human, and distinguish which was which based on their replies. A computer would be deemed to have passed the Turning Test when a human could not distinguish between its responses and a human’s.
Unsupervised Learning – a machine learning method where the model identifies patterns in unlabelled data and makes inferences for use on future, unseen data. This is useful for looking at raw data and seeing if there are patterns occurring.",1030,18.0,Canterbury Christ Church University,20.1,13.8,11155,1030,canterbury.ac.uk,20.7,331:12,,59.6,United Kingdom,"policy, technical documentation",4.373948726660647,0.4982778415614236,877,False,1030

Understanding how and when you can use AI
As a brand-new student at the University of Chester, it is important you have a good understanding of Artificial Intelligence to bolster your digital literacy and to better understand our guidelines regarding using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in your assessments:
- You should only use an artificial intelligence tool to support you in the preparation of work for assessment where your tutors have indicated that its use might be helpful or where it is part of the assessment brief.
- If you do use an artificial intelligence tool, you must clearly show which parts of your work have been created by using it and you must describe how you have used the tool.
- If you misuse an artificial intelligence tool or fail to declare the use of artificial intelligence in your work and you are later found to have breached the Academic Conduct Policy because of this, the penalties can be serious.
We understand you may have used Artificial Intelligence in your assignments at your previous institution or workplace, however it is important you follow our guidelines during your time at the University to uphold good academic conduct and learn to use AI responsibly.
Complete the AI Moodle Module
Once you have received your official Welcome email, you’ll have access to the Generative Artificial (GenAI) Intelligence Literacies module on Moodle which aims to improve your understanding of these tools and provides guidance to help you make decisions about responsible use of the tools, if your assessment brief indicates that you are permitted to use them. On this site you can also find helpful information on a range of associated topics, including prompt engineering, critically evaluating sources and the different types of GenAI tools available.
Gaining a wider, critical understanding of GenAI tools and their inputs and outputs, is useful to improve your digital skills and literacy and can help you to better understand responsible use of AI both at the university and later on in the workplace. Please take the time to complete this module before you start any assessment and remember to check your assessment briefs to identify if you are permitted to use AI or ask a tutor if you are unsure.
Further guidance on AI
If you are unsure about whether GenAI is permitted for use in your assessments, the Academic Conduct and GenAI Declaration tile on the GenAI Literacies Moodle module offers further guidance and step by step instructions about how to check whether you can use GenAI and how to declare its use.",1245,19.8,University of Chester,18.9,13.0,10860,1245,chester.ac.uk,18.5,312:00,,64.9,United Kingdom,"policy, administrative communications",4.322015403459069,0.4488372093023255,434,False,1245

Overview
Graduate competencies are defined as ‘similar to that of attributes and capabilities. All are broader than “skill” which refers to the relatively limited domains of cognitive and behavioural development and can broadly be understood to emerge from the complex interaction of the development of knowledge, applied skills, intrinsic characteristics and attitudes, and underlying values and ethical principles’ (Hager & Beckett, 1995; Hager and Holland, 2006).
Within HE, the set of competencies recognised as key for both academic and employability learner development has expanded over the years, as reflected in subject benchmarking guidelines (produced by the QAA and as evidenced in the changing elements of the Advance HE employability frameworks). In such a way a fuller range of competencies or capabilities are recognised as relevant for a range of work destinations, bearing in mind the changes in the world of work, the need for new social and environmental values and a lifespan of graduates and changing student demographics.
Graduate competencies may vary depending on the specific field of study, industry, or profession, but they generally reflect the broader skills and attributes needed to succeed in today’s changing and interconnected world. Educational institutions and employers often collaborate to ensure that graduates are equipped with the necessary competencies to excel in their chosen careers.
University of Bedfordshire Graduate competencies
Within the University of Bedfordshire, graduate competencies refer to the skills, knowledge, attributes, and abilities that individuals are expected to possess upon completing their education at the graduate level. Competencies are often considered essential for success in the workforce and in various professional contexts.
The university has agreed on a set of competencies where it is expected all students to graduate with. In addition, schools can choose course specific ‘professional’ competencies that industry would expect students to have.
As students gain competencies for their future careers, they will become more proficient in their abilities, which will naturally boost their confidence. Success and achievements in their study will validate their efforts, which leads to a positive feedback loop where self-confidence will grow with each new competency mastered . Additionally, receiving recognition and praise from their lecturers, each other, and employers in the workplace will further enhance their confidence.
The University expects that equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) would be addressed across all of the graduate competencies
It is essential that, during their learning, your students know which competencies they will be developing, and why they are important. This way your students will be able to confidently articulate their learning to others in a way that is meaningful, and evidence based.
Each of the competencies listed here will support your students to develop their self efficacy and aspirations.

Embedding Graduate Competencies into courses
Graduate competencies gained should be developed and emphaised throughout each activity, unit and assessment. Provision of specific examples of how students have improved their skills and knowledge will be beneficial. Highlight instances where students have successfully applied their learning and encourage reflection on progress. Use constructive feedback to highlight areas of growth and ensure this is celebrated as it will improve confidence and self-efficacy. The Bedfordshire Graduate Pathway outlines how to map graduate competencies across a course.
Competencies can be assessed through:
- Unit rubrics and marking criteria: Develop clear rubrics and assessment criteria for each expected competency. Be transparent and consistent so that students understand.
- Capstone projects/dissertations: Implement activity that requires students to integrate knowledge and competencies so that they are able to demonstrate their ability to navigate and solve real work life challenges.
- Portfolios: Portfolios can showcase students work, projects, and achievement throughout their academic journey.
- Internship/ part time jobs evaluations: Gather feedback from internship/placement/part time job supervisors in a pre-agreed practical application of skills gained and mastered in a professional setting.
- Standardised assessments: Utilise standardised tests or industry specific certifications to measure proficiency in key areas.
- Peer and self-assessment: Encourage learners to reflect on their own competencies and engage in discussion with their peers to provide a well-rounded view.

What will you study?
Our International Business Law LLM course will equip you with the knowledge and skills in the combined areas of global business and the law that governs it. The foundational unit on International Trade Law will provide you with a solid foundation in commercial law, with a focus on both interstate trade (in the context of the World Trade Organisation) and trade between businesses, with a specific focus on the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).
Furthermore, you will critically assess contemporary legal issues and implications for Intellectual Property Law on an international level as well as its applications involving the protection and commercial exploitation of intellectual property. The unit on International Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility will provide you with a global and comparative overview of the general corporate aspects of international business law, whilst also bringing you up to speed with the contemporary issues of social responsibility, climate change and sustainability.
In addition to examining the substantive laws and rules governing commercial transactions, you will gain a critical understanding of the laws and rules that relate to the different mechanisms for resolving disputes between businesses, including both litigation (explored in the unit International Commercial Litigation) and alternative dispute settlement (which you will study as part of our International Commercial Arbitration unit).
Finally, you will bring this acquired theory and practice together to complete an LLM Dissertation where you will conduct a major research project into a topic of your interest in the field of international business law. Here, you will engage with various sources such as statues, treaties, regulations, policy documents and other academic literature alongside the relevant research methods to help you analyse and critically evaluate your research.
How will you be assessed?
The course as a whole, and each individual unit, are designed in such a way as to enable you to build upon the knowledge and skills that you gained during your undergraduate studies and to develop greater autonomy of learning, independent analysis and critical evaluation. Learning activities and assessment tasks are designed to foster the incremental development of your subject knowledge and transferrable skills, whilst at the same time supporting your personal and professional development.
In-class learning activities are structured around lectures, seminars and workshops. Although the nature and format of the activities will vary from unit to unit, interactive learning and practice-based activities are key to all units. In-class activities and exercises will involve a mix of group discussion, debating, individual and group presentations and moots and will provide you with the opportunity to test and consolidate your knowledge and to apply it in a variety of contexts requiring analysis, evaluation and synthesis and/or problem-solving. Alongside in-class activities, you will also be expected to engage in a range of online learning activities, including virtual workshops and seminars delivered by guest speakers, training sessions for legal databases such as Lexis Nexis, Westlaw, discussion forums and group and individual e-journals.
The opportunity to be an active participant in the learning process will improve your learning experience and increase your confidence as a future legal professional. Your contribution to your own learning, and particularly your engagement with assigned reading in advance of each session, will maximise the benefit of in-class activities and your learning experience.
Throughout the course, you will be assessed in various ways. The different types of assessments will enable you to demonstrate both breadth and depth of subject knowledge and contextual understanding, whilst at the same time developing your academic and professional skills. Assessment methods which you will encounter in the course of your LLM studies include:
- Written Report or Research Essay: these assessments will enable you to develop your knowledge, legal research and critical analysis skills. You will be required to perform literature-informed research, review and evaluate the relevant sources and use an appropriate methodology in order to analyse and evaluate the relevant concepts.
- Case Study Reports: this will require you to apply your legal knowledge in the context of a specific factual scenario, in order to provide a sound legal analysis of the options available.
- Oral Presentation: by presenting your research and arguments in a formal setting, you will develop a number of transferable skills, including in particular the ability to communicate your ideas and findings in a professional, clear and concise manner.
- Mooting: this will develop your legal research, written and oral advocacy skills, by requiring you to devise a solid and convincing legal argument and articulate and defend it during simulated proceedings.
- Dissertation: in your final project, you will be required to produce an individual, independent piece of written work, supported by high-quality legal research. You will be asked to identify the research question or problem under investigation, critically review the relevant case law and academic literature, develop a sound methodology in order to explore the problem, proceed with the analysis, discuss your findings, and, where appropriate, make recommendations. This is the final step of your LLM studies and it builds on the knowledge and skills acquired in all taught units.
The notions of accountability and academic integrity play an integral role in the course. Starting from the initial induction, and in the context of each unit, you will be given extensive training on the principles of academic integrity, how to avoid plagiarism, reference legal sources, and correctly acknowledge other peoples’ work and ideas. Specific training on the use of AI tools in an academic and professional context, with a particular focus on legal practice, will also be provided. All coursework assignments will require a thorough evaluation of the sources used and all sources will need to be fully acknowledged and referenced in accordance with the OSCOLA referencing system. In the context of individual projects and coursework, students will be expected to be able to show evidence of the different stages of preparation of the final submission and to be able to present and discuss their work in its entirety upon completion.
Careers
The course will equip you with the perspective and skills necessary for a wide range of legal careers including within international law firms - many of which have departments specialised in business law - or as in-house counsel within international corporations.
Other potential careers include working as legal adviser to governmental and non-governmental organisations as well as international and intergovernmental organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD); the Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa (OHADA); the World Trade Organisation (WTO); the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO); and International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).
The course also provides an excellent pathway for further studies including postgraduate research at MPhil or PhD level.

The most widely publicised current example of this is OpenAI’s system ‘ChatGPT’, however many more exist such as Bing Chat, DALL.E and Google Bard. New products are appearing online on a regular basis and are becoming more common and embedded into some of our everyday activities (for example tools like Grammarly or Google Translate could be considered as early examples of Artificial Intelligence tools).
The rapid development of AI tools, such as ChatGPT, present valuable opportunities for students in developing skills, e.g. problem-solving, creativity, and communication skills, and can enrich and personalise student learning experiences. However, they also present substantial challenges in terms of assessment and maintaining academic integrity, hence if they are used as part of your development, these must be used wisely.
This document therefore sets out the University of South Wales (USW) position on AI and provides you, as a student of USW, with an understanding of what you should know about generative AI tools, how you might understand the appropriate use of AI, and provides you with information on complying with university expectations of academic integrity.
The University of South Wales (USW) is committed to leveraging generative AI for the benefit of both students and staff and promotes the fair, ethical, professional, and responsible use of generative AI tools. The University is committed to preparing our students for an increasingly AI-enabled future and acknowledges digital fluency as a key USW graduate attribute.
Staff at USW are exploring the implications of generative AI; both in terms of the benefits and challenges they might present in educational settings. Some apps or software can be used in ways that legitimately help students, however, AI can easily be misused (either intentionally or unintentionally) and can lead to academic misconduct and plagiarism, particularly by automatically generating seemingly original content with minimal prompting.
USW has established a working group to explore these apps and the educational benefits and limitations they may provide. Many students have contributed to the discussion about the use of these tools, and these discussions are helping to inform the University’s position on the use of these tools in terms of policy and practice.
There are some things you should be wary of regarding generative AI tools such as ChatGPT:
However, there are some positive uses of generative AI for learning that you may find beneficial:
Using AI tools to help with such things as idea generation or your planning may be an appropriate use, though the requirements of the assessment must be considered. Where the use of generative AI tools is permitted within an assessment, you may be asked to explicitly share and reflect on the prompts you have used within a generative AI tool, the resulting outputs, and any modifications you have made before final submission.
Whilst AI can benefit you in planning and structuring work, it is not acceptable to use these tools to write your entire essay or any other assessment from start to finish. You should also be aware that generative AI tools do not fact check the information generated, therefore you cannot rely on the accuracy of such tools. If you use generative AI in any part of your assessed work, it is your responsibility to check all outputs generated by the AI to make sure that the information produced is current and correct and you acknowledge its source appropriately.
To make sure your work complies with the standards expected by the university, you may find it helpful to use the table provided below, and the guidance on complying with University policy following this table:
USW has strict guidelines on student conduct and academic integrity. These stress that students must be the authors of their own work.
Work produced for summative assessment that has used, or contains content from, generative AI platforms, such as ChatGPT, without citation or declaration and/or prior academic approval, does not represent the student’s own original work so could be considered a form of academic misconduct to be dealt with under the University's Academic Misconduct procedures.
The University’s Academic Misconduct Regulations and Procedure 2023/2024 available here in English and Welsh states:
4.1 Plagiarism may be written or non-written and be considered as plagiarism when students use someone else’s work, ideas or intellectual property, including the use of Generative AI platforms such as chat GPT, without proper acknowledgment by use of correct referencing conventions, or approved method of declaration.
Therefore, if you submit content generated by generative AI tools as your own work, without citation, you might be in breach of the academic integrity policy. You should therefore ensure if you have used content or ideas from generative AI in any form, that your work appropriately uses the referencing format used within your programme of study (e.g. Harvard, APA, Vancouver). If appropriately acknowledged and referenced, this would not, in itself, constitute a breach of academic integrity. Guidance on citing and referencing AI tools can be found here.
Further guidance, and some “do’s and ‘don’ts” for using AI and referencing ChatGPT and other generative AI tools is available as part of this Artificial Intelligence (AI) library guide.
For further information or advice, please contact your course team or the library in the first instance. These will have the most relevant, useful and up-to-date information for you.

Children’s increasing exposure to digital environments has intensified concerns about online harms. Ofcom’s latest data (2023) indicates that nearly 90% of children aged 3–4 now go online (as reported by parents), a substantial rise from 52% in 2018. The use of video-sharing platforms (VSPs) such as YouTube has also surged, from 45% in 2018 to 87% in 2023, raising serious questions about the appropriateness and safety of digital content targeting young users.
Despite platform age restrictions and moderation policies, harmful content remains easily accessible. Past research revealed that children could encounter explicit or violent material within just 2–4 clicks from child-friendly videos (Halliday, 2013). This issue persists today, with numerous media investigations exposing disturbing videos labelled with popular characters like “Elsa” or “Spiderman” that depict sexualised behaviour, violence, or vandalism, deliberately bypassing filters and exploiting recommendation algorithms.
The proliferation of such risks is further compounded by the rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital services. AI-powered systems, such as algorithmic content feeds and Generative AI (GenAI) tools, can inadvertently or deliberately expose children to inappropriate content, encourage risky behaviours, and enable new forms of abuse, such as deepfakes or targeted exploitation. These harms are often amplified by business models that prioritise engagement and monetisation over safety, and by design features that exploit children’s developmental vulnerabilities.
In response, this report advocates for a proactive, evidence-based policy agenda that centres child rights and wellbeing in the design, governance, and regulation of digital platforms. Drawing on recent research, including findings from Ofcom, the VIRRAC project, and the CC-DRIVER initiative, it outlines the nature and scale of online harms, emerging threats posed by new technologies, and the structural gaps in current regulatory frameworks. The report concludes with concrete recommendations for policymakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders to embed safety-by-design, improve accountability, and ensure children can participate in digital life free from harm.

Abertay’s Sport and Exercise Sciences Division has expertise in women’s sport equity; sedentary lifestyle risk factors; exercise and health training interventions; high-intensity exercise; elite sports performance; and healthy ageing. Much of this research focuses on work involving populations with protected characteristics (e.g. age, gender, disability) and aims to contribute to the duty of care agenda, which has growing salience as an issue in contemporary sport. This complements our work with Police Scotland, Active Schools, national governing bodies, charities and SMEs.
The Division has two designated human performance laboratories for physiological measurement, a strength and conditioning laboratory, and a biomechanics laboratory to support teaching and research. These facilities allow access to EMG and ECG equipment; ergometers; biofeedback systems; accelerometry; force transducers; electronic timing systems; gas and blood analysis equipment; GSR equipment and software; BioHarness Telemetry System; Vicon 3D motion analysis system; force platform; jump mats; segmental bio-impedance; body composition analysis; and linear position transducers.
Interdisciplinary work with other divisions enables access to more specialist biochemical and molecular physiology equipment, as well as opportunities to explore realistic human movement with our games design colleague’s.
Abertay researchers have established performance partnerships with the Scottish Rugby Union, Dundee United Football Club, Dundee Football Club, Fife Flyers Ice Hockey team, and this work is generating a number of new and exciting research opportunities.
Our research programmes will prepare you for a rewarding career as an academic and researcher, as well as opening up opportunities for a diverse range of careers outside of academia.

Our stand at the University of Sunderland on Gen-AI is an Assist-Not Do approach. However, your lecturer will specify how much or little Gen-AI use is accepted with each assignment.
Additionally, always check with your lecturer on how they want transparency of Gen-AI use presented as part of your assignment. As well as referencing this could include a signed declaration of Gen-AI usage and/ or an appendix of Gen-AI prompts and outputs.
There are two types of Gen-AI when it comes to referencing. The simplest way to know the difference of the two is to ask yourself – “can others access the Gen-AI output online?”. If they can access the Gen-AI image or article, then it should be referenced as a reusable online source like you would most online materials.
If others cannot access it, then treat it as personal communication. Be prepared that your academic may request an appendix which details your private conversation with the Gen-AI source for evidence of use.

The Abertay Learning Enhancement (AbLE) Academy coordinates and delivers several staff development opportunities to support the enhancement of teaching and learning activities to improve the student experience. This includes delivering accredited provision through AdvanceHE where staff can gain categories of Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy and where new academic members of staff can complete the Postgraduate Certificate in Academic Practice (PGCAP). Alongside accredited provision, AbLE also coordinates and delivers a wide range of staff development activities through AbLE Bites, AbLE Seminars, Programme Leaders Away Days and much more. Below provides details of the full staff development offer and information on how you can engage with us.
This is an experiential route for gaining Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy. Accredited by Advance HE to allow Abertay to award Associate Fellow, Fellow and Senior Fellow, this is a route for experienced members of academic and professional staff to gain national recognition for their practice in teaching and/or supporting learning in higher education. The scheme is aligned to the Professional Standards Framework (currently the 2011 version)
Staff on the Scheme are supported through a series of workshops, circle mentor groups and 1:1 mentoring leading up to the submission of a Reflective Account of Practice (either written or recorded). After submission of your Reflective Account of Practice you will be asked to take part in a Professional Conversation to discuss your practice and how it relates to the Professional Standards Framework.
Successful candidates on the Abertay Fellowship Scheme are entitled to use the postnominals AFHEA, FHEA or SFHEA depending on which category of Fellowship you have applied for. You can also get involved in mentoring and reviewing applications for the scheme as part of your continued professional practice and keeping in good standing as a Fellow.
Staff and students enquiring about the Abertay Fellowship Scheme can contact able@.
The Postgraduate Certificate in Academic Practice (PGCAP) is designed to support academic staff who are new to teaching in higher education. The primary purpose is to ensure that new staff have a thorough understanding of the approaches and processes to teaching and learning at Abertay. The programme runs over four terms. During the first two terms participants take a 40-credit module: Fundamentals of Teaching in Higher Education (CAP511).
This module starts with an intensive two-day programme run off site. Delivery is then a blend of online material and tasks with monthly in-person workshops. The focus is on developing skills via a set of practice focused tasks that are designed to cover many of the core tasks carried out by academic staff.
The assessment is based on associated reflections and narrative pieces that require participants to interrogate the pedagogic literature. There is considerable flexibility in the mode of submission with participants required to use a range of different modes to submit the narrative and reflective pieces (written, audio, video, and professional conversation)
The work covered in the first two terms leads to Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy.
In terms 3 and 4 the focus is on the evaluation of practice via a 20-credit module: Action Research in Educational Practice (CAP512). Within this module participants run a small research project based on their own teaching practice. Participants submit a research proposal, but the main submission is a negotiated output and can, for instance take the form of a research paper or a presentation. Participants are encouraged to share their findings both internally and with the wider academic community.
For more information regarding the PGCAP please email able@.
For all staff new to Abertay who have a role in teaching or supporting learning, the AbLE team offer the Quick Start programme. This is a short programme of 2.5 days that is online and in person culminating with all participants delivering a short (5min) teaching session. Postgraduate students who want to teach on Abertay programmes need to participate in the Quick Start programme as the first part of the Introduction to Learning and Teaching at Abertay Scheme.
The first day of Quick Start is an in-person and introduced the Abertay teaching and learning ethos with sessions on our student body, teaching large and small groups as well as the role of reflection in developing teaching practice. On day 2 we move online and look at some of the processes that underpin teaching at Abertay as well as take a closer look at how to plan a teaching session. This will support the session on day 3 when all participants will deliver a short teaching session on a topic of their choice.
The Quick Start programme is run twice a year (October and February).
For further details about Quick start please contact able@.
The Introduction to Teaching and learning at Abertay Scheme is open to postgraduate students who are involved with teaching. The Quick Start programme makes up the first segment of the scheme. The second segment, Teaching and Learning Practice at Abertay involves teaching observations by a mentor and a peer so participants must be delivering teaching to Abertay students to participate. Successful completion of the third and final segment, Reflection on teaching Practice at Abertay can lead to Associate Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy. To complete this segment participants, need to log 20hrs of teaching practice (of which 10hrs needs to be student facing), submit a Reflective Account of Academic practice and participate in a professional conversation.
The Introduction to Teaching and Learning scheme has 2 start points (October and February).
For further information about the Introduction to Learning and Teaching at Abertay, please contact your research supervisor or/and able@.
AbLE seminars and Able Bites aim to develop teaching and learning practice within the University. Seminars can be focused on exploration of topics in depth or encompass a range of activities such as workshops on implementing aspects of the University strategic plan or sharing aspects of practice. The seminars are normally run on the first Wednesday of the month and are in-person or online. We aim to include some external speakers in the programme as well as showcasing practice and developments within the University.
AbLE bites are short (30min) online session that focus on a specific area of practice. These are held at a range of times and are run online and recorded. Topics for the AbLE bites range from sharing a tool to generate feedback to advice on increasing engagement in tutorials. The AbLE bites are an excellent way of sharing your practice across the University and a great way to find out about good practice within the institution.
If you would like to contribute an AbLE seminar or an AbLE bite, please contact the AbLE team - email able@.
Assessment and feedback are fundamental parts of the student experience and Abertay seeks to constantly innovate and improve these. Over the past year, all academic schools and professional services have been involved in a working group looking at our practices and where these can be enhanced. 2023-24 will be a focused year on assessment and feedback looking to implement and embed the work of the working group including a new assessment typology with a wide range of different types of authentic assessments being described; a new assessment brief to support students in understand their assessments, a set of feedback principles and resources to help staff and students give good quality feedback on assessments and how to use that feedback in improving future work. These are being supported by a range of workshops, Assessment Jams, internal and externally facilitated webinars and written and recorded resources. We are engaged in cross-sector research projects on assessment and feedback and so using our work at Abertay to add to sector knowledge and understanding. For more information about our work or to express an interest in collaboration, please contact able@.
Abertay is committed to supporting staff in developing leadership skills and one of the ways we do this is through our support for programme leaders and aspiring programme leaders. In partnership with other areas of the university, the AbLE Academy hosts an annual programme leader’s away day (which is also open to aspiring programme leaders and those who support programme leaders), supports the creation of resources and the formation of a new programme leaders’ network within Abertay. We are also involved in sector-wide collaborative work to support the role of programme leadership across Scotland. You can find some of the related resources on the Enhancement Theme pages with two projects: Enhancing Programme Leadership and Programme Leadership: Strengthening resilience, supporting learning communities.
As well as AbLE Seminars and AbLE Bites, the AbLE Academy also facilitate bespoke workshops for colleagues. These can be delivered at special interest group, external partner, module, programme, Faculty, Department or Directorate level. Previous examples include workshops for the microcredential module leads, sessions at School Away Days on current issues in academic practice, online workshops on authentic assessment at Department level, facilitating programme redesign, and the Abertay learning and teaching approach for external partners.
AbLE Academy is leading a project that aims to embed an inclusive learning practice that reflects Abertay’s policies and values into the curriculum. This Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) in the curriculum project will adopt a co-creative approach to developing an inclusive and welcoming community. We are building on the great work already being done by academics across the institution and the sector to build a curriculum that is equitable in practice. AbLE’s approach also incorporates principles of anti-racism and decolonisation with the following three ambitions:
Creating a learning community that is diverse and inclusive in its teaching and that supports staff and students.
Enabling the development of competent and engaged professionals who are active citizens and address bigotry in its various forms. These students will be prepared not just to be good employees but to engage more effectively with the diverse societies they will join after graduation.
Embedding equity in teaching and learning activities to create a space that is accessible, safe and belonging for a diverse student and staff base. These students will be enabled to challenge inequalities within the classroom and wider society.
A taste of the actions as part of this work which is only the starting point on our journey:
A cohesive EDI policy for the curriculum has been drafted based on the programme audits with programme leaders earlier in the spring and a consultation process in the fall with the student body and wider staff complement will explore the methods of embedding EDI in the curriculum.
CPD and training: AbLE seminars and bites on incorporating the following in teaching and learning practice e.g. delivery and assessment: Cultural sensitivity, Race Equality, Gender Equality, Neurodiversity, Supporting widening participation/access students, LGBTQIA+ Equality, Accessibility in digital and f2f teaching.
Reviewing the Abertay Attributes to embed EDI and anti-racism at the programme level.
Creation of programme or departmental level interest groups to support disciplinary approaches to embedding EDI in the curriculum. These groups will help with programme mapping of EDI, decolonisation and anti-racism highlights and gaps in our curriculum with the support of the AbLE team.
Co-creative projects with students, the archivist and the Student Association to create artifacts that demonstrate the progress of Abertay through the eras regarding EDI.
For further information on our EDI in the curriculum work please contact k.fletcher@.
The Teaching Excellence, The Student Journey and Digital Education aspects of Abertay’s Learning Enhancements strategy are all affected by Generative AI. To advance understanding and disseminate good practice in our Teaching and Learning, Assessment, and approach to Academic Misconduct in relation to AI - generative AI, in particular - activities for staff and updates to guidance for staff and students will take place for and into Academic Year 23/24.
As part of wider Teaching, Learning and Assessment initiatives, AbLE Assessment Jams will take place throughout the summer months and term-time. The Assessment Jams are designed as dynamic and interactive workshops, where participants can work intensively on one of their own assessments to consider, for example, Assessment design and challenges of ChatGPT.
AbLE Seminars: Throughout the Academic Year AbLE will run seminars with a strong Assessment focus, some of which will consider topics around AI.
Informal meetups, such as the Able Summer Coffee hours, giving staff the opportunity to chat with colleagues about all things relating to teaching, and learning with Generative AI likely to be a topic of conversation.
Updates to AbLE Staff and Student Guidance regarding Generative AI, will be made available prior to start of Term 1. Updates will be based on sector guidance and best practice and our own, i.e. University/School/Division learning.
Abertay University's graduate employment figures have been steadily improving with an 8% increase in graduate level employment in 2023. AbLE Academy continues to be engaged in work to establish employability best practice that is embedded within programmes at the university. This work, in 2023, has led to a series of workshops for staff and students to develop and share best practice across programme teams. In addition, the microcredential development at years one and two offers a student focused approach that will support a focus on student future careers and skills. Over 60% of 1st year students have undertaken ABE107 Planning your Future Career a first year microcredential.
The University has a detailed Employability Strategy which directly relates to the Learning Enhancement Strategy. These aligned strategies are up for review in 2025 and work to develop these will be informed by AbLE’s leadership in this area. This work will draw heavily upon existing knowledge, structures and innovative approaches that are already in place at Abertay and will seek out excellence across the sector.

Digital Education is now part and parcel of our teaching, learning and Assessment. Whether via Blended or Fully online learning, on or off campus, synchronous or asynchronous, we are dependent on digital tools and systems to delivery our teaching activity. The Able Academy lead the development of Digital Education, which is one strand of the current Learning Enhancement Strategy- to help support staff and students make the best use and enhance the use of digital tools and training to support learning and assessment.
The Learning Technologies Development Forum brings together stakeholders from across the university with a teaching and learning focus to help discuss, inform and advise the development of learning technologies core to our teaching at Abertay. The focus is on the enhancement of our existing and future learning technologies to bring benefits to both students and staff. Core to the remit of this forum is to review existing practices, problem solve and propose measures for the continuous improvement of learning technology integration and delivery. In particular, there is a focus on the VLE and how learning technologies can deliver the support of learning, teaching and assessment, both on a changing campus and online. Staff training and support is key to delivery of our vision of a modern, intuitive digital experience and we work closely with Technology Enhanced Learning Support (TELS) colleagues to support all staff, and students in how to make best use of systems and share best practice.
We are keen to collaborate with staff and students from across the university and beyond to develop our digital education provision.

Even though it's best to sort out your application before the UCAS deadline, you still have a chance to land a place. However, you should know that there are no guarantees universities will give equal consideration to your late application.
UCAS Extra
You have two main options if you missed the 2025 UCAS deadline. The first one is to apply through UCAS Extra. If you used all five choices on your UCAS application form and you’re not holding any offers, you can still find a place at university by adding another choice through Extra, between 26 February and 4 July.
You can also add another choice if you didn't use up all your choices in your original UCAS application, as long as you do this before 30 June, and you haven’t accepted or declined any offers. You don't need to use Extra to do this.
If you don’t hold any offers after 5 July, you'll be able to add an additional choice through Clearing, the second option available to you for applying if you missed the January deadline.
Clearing
Clearing is for:
- Anyone who hasn't yet applied for university but wants to enrol on a course in September
- Anyone who hasn’t achieved the grades required and who hasn’t been accepted for their first (firm) or second (insurance) choice university
- Anyone who hasn't yet received any offers for a place at a university.
Any empty places are up for grabs during Clearing and it usually operates on a first come, first served basis. Once you’ve found a course that you like, get in touch with the University of Sunderland (or another university of your choosing), or visit our Clearing page to see if there are places on the course you're interested in. Once you’ve been accepted, you can add the university as your Clearing choice in UCAS Track.
Turn your dream career into reality
Amy Orange called our Clearing helpline and landed a place on the LLB Law course. Three years later, she graduated with a First Class Honours degree, and has since completed her Legal Practice Course (LPC) and LLM Legal Practice, and is now working as a family law solicitor.
""I applied for the LLB (Hons) Law degree at the University of Sunderland through Clearing. I remember calling the helpline on A Level results day and chatting to the lecturers, who were amazing and put my mind at ease. I was accepted onto the course and in hindsight, I’m so glad I ended up studying here. I’m a massive believer in everything happening for a reason!""

You're not alone.
Choosing the right search tool can save time and improve your results — especially as you move from early assignments to more in-depth research.
This guide will help you pick the right tools for your task, avoid paywalls, and access reliable academic content quickly and legally.
- Search
- Resources
- Journals
LibrarySearch is Abertay’s main academic search tool. It brings together almost everything the university provides access to — all in one place.
- Searches across books, articles, eBooks, and more
- Shows everything Abertay subscribes to — so you don’t waste time on sources you can't access or hit unexpected paywalls
- Includes Open Access content, giving you a wider view of academic research
- Supports good academic habits, helping you find citable, credible sources quickly
- Gives you full-text access where available, whether you're on or off campus
- Offers extra features when you sign in — like saving results, setting alerts, and exporting to RefWorks (a tool to manage and cite your references)
Tip: Use LibrarySearch first for academic sources across all subjects — then extend your search using the other tools below if needed.
Most required readings should be accessible through your module’s reading list (Leganto). But LibrarySearch is still essential when:
- You’re following up a source mentioned in class or feedback
- You’re working on a dissertation or independent research
- You want to explore a topic beyond the essentials
Want to make the most of Abertay’s main academic search tool? Read our full guide to using LibrarySearch.
Start with LibrarySearch — but depending on your topic or level of study, it can be helpful to try additional tools alongside it.
Each tool has a different strength — and knowing when and how to combine them can save you time and improve your results.
You might want to:
- Explore Open Access content that doesn’t appear in LibrarySearch
- Use specialist features such as citation tracking
- Find preprints or papers from disciplines not well covered by traditional databases
- Search topics in subjects that aren't well covered in some databases
Here’s how the tools differ across key features:
Tip: On mobile devices, swipe sideways to see all columns.
Note: Semantic Scholar uses AI to summarise papers and suggest related research — but it doesn’t search full-text content or cover all subject areas.
Tip: You don’t need to use every tool — just choose the right one for your task.
Start with LibrarySearch — then add others to extend your search if needed.
Note: We’ve introduced Scopus and Web of Science separately below, as their feature set is quite different from the other tools shown in the table.
They also focus on citation data and abstracts, rather than direct full-text access.
Google Scholar is an academic search engine from Google. Use it to:
-
Search more broadly for literature reviews
-
Look up citations and author publication histories
-
Find Open Access versions of paywalled journal articles
It doesn’t always link to Abertay subscriptions — but it can complement LibrarySearch.
Tip: You can configure Google Scholar to show “View It @ Abertay” links for easier access to full text — even off campus.
See Configure Google Scholar for Abertay Access
Important: Just because something appears in Google Scholar doesn’t mean it’s suitable for academic work — always evaluate your sources critically.
Semantic Scholar is a free academic search engine focused on science, technology, medicine, and psychology. Use it to:
- Find recent research or preprints not yet indexed in LibrarySearch
- Explore citation links, related papers, or an author’s influence
- Use AI-powered features like one-sentence summaries or paper comparison tools
Note: Semantic Scholar doesn’t include books or reflect Abertay’s subscriptions — and its coverage is strongest in science, medicine, and psychology.
It complements LibrarySearch when you want to explore research more broadly or semantically — especially in STEM fields.
Want to explore its features? Read our full guide to Semantic Scholar
Scopus and Web of Science are advanced academic databases that focus on peer-reviewed research and citation analysis. They are particularly useful for:
- Final-year undergraduate and postgraduate dissertations
- Independent research or literature reviews
- Tracking who has cited a specific paper
- Exploring influential authors, journals, or research trends
Why not in the comparison table?
These platforms work differently from LibrarySearch and Google Scholar — they don’t provide full-text access and are designed for citation tracking and high-level research analysis.
Scopus covers science, technology, medicine, social sciences, and more — with tools for citation analysis and visual trend mapping.
Web of Science offers similar features, with particularly strong coverage in the natural sciences and historical citation data going back further than most tools.
Tip: You can use LibrarySearch or the Abertay Links button to check whether Abertay provides full-text access to articles you find in these databases.
Want to learn more?
These are not search engines in the traditional sense — but they can help you explore research topics, map the literature, summarise papers, and answer research questions.
Use them to support discovery, scoping, and understanding — but remember, they don’t replace formal academic search tools like LibrarySearch, Scopus, or subject databases.
- AI-Powered Literature Mapping Tools – Find research papers visually using maps of citations, topics, or authors.
- GenAI Research Assistants – Use AI to summarise papers, extract key information, and answer research questions.
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot can help you
- Brainstorm ideas
- Summarise information
- Explore a topic
But they:
- Don’t search academic databases
- Don’t show what Abertay provides access to
- May generate inaccurate or made-up sources
If you're using GenAI tools for study or research:
-
Use them critically and ethically
-
Always check any sources using LibrarySearch or another academic tool
-
Don’t rely on GenAI tools for final outputs, citations, or referencing — they may fabricate sources or give outdated or biased answers.
For more advice, see our guide to Critically evaluating GenAI outputs.
Tip: Want to better understand how search engines and Generative AI tools differ? See our explainer on Search Engines vs AI Tools — it matters for your research approach.
Need help?
Still not feeling confident? That’s okay — we’re here to support you.

Abertay’s Sport and Exercise Sciences Division has expertise in women’s sport equity; sedentary lifestyle risk factors; exercise and health training interventions; high-intensity exercise; elite sports performance; and healthy ageing. Much of this research focuses on work involving populations with protected characteristics (e.g. age, gender, disability) and aims to contribute to the duty of care agenda, which has growing salience as an issue in contemporary sport. This complements our work with Police Scotland, Active Schools, national governing bodies, charities and SMEs.
The Division has two designated human performance laboratories for physiological measurement, a strength and conditioning laboratory, and a biomechanics laboratory to support teaching and research. These facilities allow access to EMG and ECG equipment; ergometers; biofeedback systems; accelerometry; force transducers; electronic timing systems; gas and blood analysis equipment; GSR equipment and software; BioHarness Telemetry System; Vicon 3D motion analysis system; force platform; jump mats; segmental bio-impedance; body composition analysis; and linear position transducers.
Interdisciplinary work with other divisions enables access to more specialist biochemical and molecular physiology equipment, as well as opportunities to explore realistic human movement with our games design colleague’s.
Abertay researchers have established performance partnerships with the Scottish Rugby Union, Dundee United Football Club, Dundee Football Club, Fife Flyers Ice Hockey team, and this work is generating a number of new and exciting research opportunities.
Our research programmes will prepare you for a rewarding career as an academic and researcher, as well as opening up opportunities for a diverse range of careers outside of academia.
You have the option of studying an MSc by Research, an MPhil or a PhD.
When deciding which degree is right for you, you should consider the level of commitment required, the duration, cost and your career aspirations.
That being said, our research degrees are flexible. You can begin an MSc by Research or an MPhil and then seek to transfer to a PhD without having to start your project all over again. You can also switch from full-time to part-time study, and vice versa.

Abertay offers a range of funded PhD and Masters projects for enthusiastic and ambitious candidates who are interested in pursuing a research degree at Abertay University.
Funded PhD and Research Masters projects are available to students who hold (or expect to gain) either a First Class Honours degree, an Upper Second Class Honours degree or a Masters qualification.
The studentships described below are divided into three categories:
Open – Applications are currently open for these studentships. You can find further details on the Abertay jobs page and .
Closed – These studentships are now closed for applications, however, you may be interested in seeing the topics we have funded previously.
Project Title: Profiling hardware and feasibility of new board development to support local AI in ATMs for enhanced security.
Please note, this is open to home students only.
PhD Studentship: cyberQuarter. The Studentship is available for an October 2025 start.
Project Description: An intelligent ATM is an ideal solution to analyse and monitor the local device for possible physical or cyber threats. A typical ATM system is suitable to host such environments. A typical system, consisting of several processing units with variable memory, can be profiled to pool the resources. The analytical systems, developed on data collected by onboard sensors and software triggers, can assist the operating environment in reducing threats with increased efficiency. The system will propose a novel approach for data collection, temporary storage and transport to designated online places for processing and visualization purposes. The system will be able to present knowledge-based actionable information that can lead to informed real-time decision-making and reduced downtimes.
The outcome produced by this research will assist in making informed decisions about ATM security. The study will investigate and propose novel hardware with a device capable of hosting AI-powered security services. It will aim at engineering or technical managers to plan and execute project activities for hardware and software engineers. The guidelines and specifications will allow hardware and firmware engineers to develop proof-of-concept hardware. Hardware engineers will be able to verify their design and draft a Bill of Material (BOM) based on the proposed requirements. The firmware engineers will be able to write a software stack to make the developed hardware functional. The findings and publications will stipulate BOM, PCB layout, and firmware guidelines. The artefacts might include flow diagrams, use cases, electronics block diagrams, the high-level layout of component arrangements or source code.
Supervisory Team: The candidate will be supervised within the Cybersecurity and Computing by Dr Abdul Razaq and Dr Sanaz Kavianpour. Queries on this project should be directed to Dr. Sanaz Kavianpour (s.kavianpour@).
Entry Requirements: Candidates must have, or expect to obtain, a first class or upper second-class honours honours degree in a computing, cybersecurity, ethical hacking (or equivalent), or a closely aligned discipline. We are looking for an independent, enthusiastic, and driven candidate with an understanding of AI and IOT.
The successful candidate will have to have some experience of working AI and/or IOT devices. Candidates must work well with others and represent the university when working with key stakeholders (e.g., cyberQuarter partners).
For applicants who are non-native speakers of English, the University requires IELTS of 7.0 (with no band less than 6.5) or an equivalent qualification accepted by the Home Office.
Applications and closing date: 8th of August 2025
Applicants should submit through the Abertay University jobs page submitting a personal statement of application detailing why you are interested in undertaking this project, and a CV.
If you are selected for interview you will be required to complete an online Research Student Application Form which includes the submission of a research proposal.

PhD Studentship: cyberQuarter funded. The Studentship is available for an October 2025 start.
A PhD studentship that comprises tax-free stipend of £20,870 (increasing in line with UKRI per annum), tuition fees paid, and a generous study package (e.g., limited research consumables, travel budget, and training when appropriate) each year for 3 years. The studentship is fully funded for 3 years.
Project Description:
The increasing use of encryption in IoT communications hinders traditional deep packet inspection for malware detection. This research aims to develop lightweight, behaviour-based anomaly detection systems. These systems will identify malicious activity or compromised IoT devices by analysing encrypted traffic patterns, focusing on metadata, flow characteristics, and timing rather than decrypting payloads.
The core challenge is creating features and models sensitive to malicious deviations while remaining resource efficient. Solutions must operate effectively on network gateways or even capable IoT devices. The research will investigate statistical methods, machine learning, and information-theoretic approaches to achieve robust, non-intrusive security for the ever-expanding IoT landscape.
Supervisory Team: The candidate will be supervised within the Division of Cybersecurity and Computing by Prof Ian Ferguson and Dr. Salma Elsayed. Mr Sean Sturley will act as advisor. Queries on this project should be directed to Professor Ian Ferguson (i.ferguson@).
Entry Requirements: Candidates must have, or expect to obtain, a first class or upper second-class honours degree in a computing, cybersecurity, ethical hacking (or equivalent), or a closely aligned discipline. We are looking for an independent, enthusiastic, and driven candidate with an understanding of AI and IOT.
The successful candidate will have to have some experience of working AI and/or IOT devices. Candidates must work well with others and represent the university when working with key stakeholders (e.g., cyberQuarter partners).
For applicants who are non-native speakers of English, the University requires IELTS of 7.0 (with no band less than 6.5) or an equivalent qualification accepted by the Home Office.
Applications and closing date: 8th of August 2025
Applicants should submit through the Abertay University jobs page submitting a personal statement of application detailing why you are interested in undertaking this project, and a CV.
If you are selected for interview you will be required to complete an online Research Student Application Form which includes the submission of a research proposal.

Project Title: Autonomous AI-powered red agents for enhanced cybersecurity
Please note, this is open to home students only.
PhD Studentship: cyberQuarter. The Studentship is available for an October 2025 start.
A PhD studentship that comprises tax-free stipend of £20,870 (increasing in line with UKRI per annum), tuition fees paid, and a generous study package (e.g., limited research consumables, travel budget, and training when appropriate) each year for 3 years. The studentship is fully funded for 3 years
Project Description:
Advances in AI are extending the capabilities of tools for penetration testing (i.e. red agents). However, due to a fragmented market, rapid technical developments, and nascent research the extent of capabilities and optimal solution architectures are not well understood. Current research identifies an active and growing research field, with numerous advancements in the past 18 months. A focus on generative AI agents has progressed capabilities towards exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. Frontier models show superior performance when combined with a focused knowledge base and multi-agent architectures. However, in most cases human involvement is still required, and fully autonomous solutions are not yet evident.
There are several aspects that should be considered:
This project aims to advance the state of AI-powered red agents by developing an adaptive multi-agent framework capable of learning about its environment and evolving attack scenarios. By enabling more realistic and dynamic adversarial simulations this project will support the creation of more effective cybersecurity testing, consequently strengthening organisational resilience against emerging threats. The proposed research question is: What design approaches enable an autonomous AI-powered red agent to effectively detect system vulnerabilities and emulate realistic adversarial behaviours?
The proposed approach will focus on developing a multi-agent AI framework that integrates traditional penetration testing methodologies with machine learning techniques and advanced generative AI models. This framework should be engineered to simulate a range of attack scenarios with high fidelity (i.e. exploitation of network and device vulnerabilities). Abertay University possesses a mature, well-engineered cyber-range which is available to the project to simulate a wide variety of target systems and set-ups. By combining established cybersecurity practices with adaptive AI-driven techniques, the framework aims to enhance the effectiveness of red team operations.
Supervisory Team: The candidate will be supervised within the Cybersecurity and Computing by Dr Jacques Ophoff, Dr Sanaz Kavianpour and Dr Karl van der Schyff. Queries on this project should be directed to Dr Jacques Ophoff (j.ophoff@).
Entry Requirements: Candidates must have, or expect to obtain, a first class or upper second-class honours honours degree in a computing, cybersecurity, ethical hacking (or equivalent), or a closely aligned discipline. We are seeking an independent, enthusiastic, and driven candidate with a strong understanding of AI and offensive security.
The successful candidate will have to have some experience of working with AI .
Candidates must work well with others and represent the university when working with key stakeholders (e.g., cyberQuarter partners and Scottish Government).

This is a potential research degree area, subject to the approval of the University. If you are interested in undertaking a research degree in this area, please contact PGRS Recruitment.
Cybersecurity at Abertay University covers a wide range of applied and theoretical research covering all dimensions of the cybersecurity arena. Our research covers human-centred security, secure environments and intrusion detection.
Cybersecurity is globally recognised as a serious concern. The UK government, in their 2010 National Security Strategy, rated cyber attacks as a Tier 1 threat. Despite a national austerity stance, the UK government is spending millions of pounds to ensure that this particular risk is mitigated. Abertay University is in a unique position to make a contribution to this endeavour due to our spread of research activity across the entire cybersecurity spectrum and our cross-disciplinary approach to the problem. We also have close ties with industry and law enforcement that ensure that we understand the problems being faced at the coal face. In this way we are able address the real and pertinent issues in the area, and our research can have maximum impact.
Our vibrant research culture encourages areas of cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary working, and draws from software good practice including secure software development, development of innovative forensic techniques and deployment of behavioural science in improving human resilience.
We are a member of the Cyber Nexus network (SICSA), a collaboration of Scottish universities whose goal it is to provide world-leading postgraduate education and research experiences. The SICSA programme prepares graduates for careers as researchers, academics and for a diverse range of local, national and international careers and professions outside of academia. The Cyber Nexus network fosters collaboration and development of cybersecurity researchers across Scottish universities and nurtures interactions between academia and the cybersecurity industry.

We have been a key partner in a number of large European grants specifically examining the interaction between technology, society and social innovation, as well as exploring social network dynamics for collective awareness.
Division staff have supervised a wide range of projects some of which have entailed partnership with non-academic user groups in the domains of:
Policy sociology – health, education, youth, environment, influencing public policy, communities and professional practice.
Criminal justice – influencing policing and criminal justice stakeholders.
Media, arts and cultural industries – centring on digital design processes, media educationalists, artists and curators.
Collaborations exist with criminal justice and policing researchers through the inter-university Scottish Institute for Policing Research (SIPR), the Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance (SICSA), and with media educationalists through the Association for Media Education in Scotland (AMES).
Our research programmes will prepare you for a rewarding career as an academic and researcher, as well as opening up opportunities for a diverse range of careers outside of academia, for example, in formulating policy.
You have the option of studying an MSc by Research, an MPhil or a PhD.
When deciding which degree is right for you, you should consider the level of commitment required, the duration, cost and your career aspirations.
That being said, our research degrees are flexible. You can begin an MSc by Research or an MPhil and then seek to transfer to a PhD without having to start your project all over again. You can also switch from full-time to part-time study, and vice versa.

Abertay’s Sport and Exercise Sciences Division has expertise in women’s sport equity; sedentary lifestyle risk factors; exercise and health training interventions; high-intensity exercise; elite sports performance; and healthy ageing. Much of this research focuses on work involving populations with protected characteristics (e.g. age, gender, disability) and aims to contribute to the duty of care agenda, which has growing salience as an issue in contemporary sport. This complements our work with Police Scotland, Active Schools, national governing bodies, charities and SMEs.
The Division has two designated human performance laboratories for physiological measurement, a strength and conditioning laboratory, and a biomechanics laboratory to support teaching and research. These facilities allow access to EMG and ECG equipment; ergometers; biofeedback systems; accelerometry; force transducers; electronic timing systems; gas and blood analysis equipment; GSR equipment and software; BioHarness Telemetry System; Vicon 3D motion analysis system; force platform; jump mats; segmental bio-impedance; body composition analysis; and linear position transducers.
Interdisciplinary work with other divisions enables access to more specialist biochemical and molecular physiology equipment, as well as opportunities to explore realistic human movement with our games design colleague’s.
Abertay researchers have established performance partnerships with the Scottish Rugby Union, Dundee United Football Club, Dundee Football Club, Fife Flyers Ice Hockey team, and this work is generating a number of new and exciting research opportunities.

Abertay’s research culture encourages areas of cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary working that are consubstantial to the latest evolutions of the marketing discipline.
We are particularly attentive to the latest evolutions in knowledge and practice that relate to strategic and digital marketing, and consumer behaviour. For example, the phenomenon of social media influencers presents ample opportunities for research, considering that billions of consumers regularly use social media platforms. Potential topics could include determinants of social media influencer success and ways in which social media influencers affect consumer behaviour.
We are a member of the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) network and work very closely with industry. We preserve this proximity by encouraging dialogue with industry and opportunities for our students to work on marketing problems faced by real companies.
A research degree at Abertay is excellent preparation for a career as a researcher and an academic, as well as a diverse range of professions outside of academia.

Data Science and Systems Modelling at Abertay covers a wide range of areas at the interface between computer games and complex systems, including in physics, healthcare and the environment.
Our overarching agenda is the construction of interactive, real-time and playable simulations in both entertainment and non-entertainment contexts that bring to life systems models through simulation, i.e., digital twins. This playability allows domain experts to investigate complex systems in an intuitive way and supports discovery of new insights. These simulations are underpinned by data-driven models, including AI, to make sense of large real-world data sets. The opportunities at the games-complexity interface are growing, for example how AI and neural networks can generate content for games, and how data analytics can improve the player experience, and research students working in this area have the potential to generate impact on challenging real-world problems.
Research in this field draws upon supervisory expertise from within the School of Design and Informatics, including academics with track record in mathematics, physics, artificial intelligence, games programming, and games industry experience.
Our research at Abertay is inherently cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary, which is of particular importance for research in immersive experiences. We are the lead partner for InGAME: Innovation for Games and Media Enterprise, an AHRC-funded R&D centre for Dundee’s games cluster. Postgraduate students at the University will have access to research and development opportunities, as well as contact with professionals working within the games industry.
Undertaking a research degree in Data Science and Systems Modelling at Abertay will prepare you for a career not only in academia but also within wider society, working in complex problem spaces and using modelling and visualisation to unpack that complexity.
You have the option of studying an MSc by Research, an MPhil or a PhD.
When deciding which degree is right for you, you should consider the level of commitment required, the duration, cost and your career aspirations.
That being said, our research degrees are flexible. You can begin an MSc by Research or an MPhil and then seek to transfer to a PhD without having to start your project all over again. You can also switch from full-time to part-time study, and vice versa.

Our Accounting team have a broad area of experience which can be grouped into 3 areas: Accounting for sustainability, Oil and Gas Accounting, and Corruption and Governance.
A research project in the area of renewable energy, sustainability and environmental accountability could address issues concerning financial/nonfinancial measurements, reporting, as well as financial analysis relating to conventional energy, nonconventional energy, transitioning to clean energy, carbon emission and pursuit of global environmental sustainability objectives.
Within Oil and Gas Accounting and Finance (OGAF), Abertay has a very strong history of research projects, PhD supervision and publications in high-quality journals on such issues as corporate disclosures on environmental issues; abandonment problems associated with oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea and Nigeria and the implications for UK governmental policy; gas flaring and oil spillage, legitimacy and environmental disclosures. These projects have shown that some corporations disclose environmental information (including oil and gas related information) so as to either legitimise their activities or to report a more favourable set of accounts. The group intends to build on this work, through PhD supervisions by studying the link between environmental disclosures and corporate performance; environmental responsibilities and governmental control; legitimacy and regulation; internationalisation of standards and corporate accountability, and oil and gas reserves valuation.
Research within corruption can be approached from a number of different disciplinary angles including law, economics, business leadership and public policy. This interdisciplinary topic provides an opportunity to look at the governance of organisations through different lenses. Projects have included the impact of corruption on economic development, gender inequality and corruption and models of misgovernance.
A research degree in this area may appeal if you are looking to develop a career in the national energy sectors, the renewable energy generation/distribution subsector and related international energy organisations. A research degree at Abertay can also prepare you for a rewarding career as an academic and researcher.

The University Student Handbook defines plagiarism ""as the representation of another person’s work or work produced using Artificial Intelligence (AI), without acknowledgement of the source, as the student’s own."" In other words, if you do not reference your source, you are plagiarising and committing academic misconduct.
If you plagiarise, you may fail and may be asked to attend an avoiding plagiarism/referencing course. However, you can easily avoid plagiarism and academic misconduct by doing proper referencing. In this section, you will learn about different forms of plagiarism and how to avoid them by referencing properly using our Cite Them Right Harvard referencing guide. Once you finish exploring this section, do not forget the final step.
What is plagiarism exactly?
- Presenting any part of someone else’s work as your own; this includes:
- the work of other students
- paying for work to be written by someone else and handed in as your own work
- visual material, such as photographs you obtained online and have not given credit to the creator
- Using a source of information word for word without quotation marks
- Paraphrasing or summarising material in your assignment without acknowledging the original source through in-text citation and reference
- Changing a few words of someone else’s work but keeping their sentence structure – for example, ‘The company made a profit’/‘The firm made a profit’
- Copying lyrics or parts of a music composition in your own work
- Making minor changes to another person's images or designs without crediting the original source
- 'Recycling' a piece of your own work that you have previously submitted for another module or course
- Citing and referencing sources that you have not used
- Using too many quotations so that your work is little more than the work of others (even if referenced), held together by linking sentences you have written
- Working with another person to produce an assignment and not declaring this (collusion)
How do I avoid plagiarism?
It is really simple:
- Never construct an assignment or dissertation by cutting and pasting from other ones
- Use Library Search not Google to find academic sources
- Use several different academic sources in every work
- Leave yourself enough time to read, analyse, and incorporate a variety of resources in your work
- Be careful with your own work - do not leave copies around
- Do proper referencing from the first draft (use automation whenever available but check the output)
- Get into the habit of referencing properly using the Cite Them Right guide
Watch the short video about the Cite Them Right Harvard referencing guide.
Basics of referencing using Cite Them Right
You can use other people’s words and sentences in your own work in various ways:
- By directly quoting (i.e. copying and pasting or typing an author’s words exactly as they are)
- By paraphrasing (i.e. using your own words to describe what the author is saying)
- By summarising (e.g. summarising the main points of a whole book or an article)
Then, in order to avoid plagiarism, you need to complete these two essential parts in your work to acknowledge the sources you have used:
- Identify your sources by mentioning the author, date, and page number/s (if applicable) briefly in the body of your work immediately when you quote/paraphrase/summarise someone else’s work: this is called citation or in-text citation (see here how to do it - requires logging in)
- List each of your sources in detail (author/s, date, title, publication details, etc.) at the end of your work in alphabetical order by author’s surname: this is called a reference list or bibliography (see here what details to include in your reference list - requires logging in)
These two parts should correspond to each other. See in the guide here how your citations and reference list entries should match (requires logging in).
Direct quotations using Cite Them Right
If you use direct quotations, there are strict rules for separating your words from what you have taken from someone else.
You may use short direct quotations (couple of sentences) or longer direct quotations (a whole paragraph, for example). There are different rules for separating them from your own words.
- A short quotation should start and end with quotation marks. After you close the quotation mark, you then immediately enter your in-text citation in round parentheses according to the rules set out in the Cite them right guide. See examples here (requires logging in).
- A long quotation should be entered as an indented new paragraph, by leaving space between your words and the quotation – you do not use quotation marks anymore. At the end of the paragraph, you immediately enter your in-text citation in round parentheses according to rules set out in the Cite them right guide. See example here (requires logging in).
Paraphrasing using Cite Them Right
When paraphrasing, you are not using the author’s words exactly as they are; so, you do not use quotation marks or separate paragraphs anymore.
Because you are using your own language and style, the placement of the in-text citation may vary: it does not need to be at the end of the sentence. Also, all the information required may not be in the round parentheses – some of the information can be outside the round parentheses. See example here (requires logging in).
Summarising using Cite Them Right
The rules are similar to paraphrasing. You are using your own language and style to summarise the main points of a work; therefore, there is flexibility with the placement and contents of the in-text citation. Also, page numbers are not applicable anymore. See example here (requires logging in).
Reference list using Cite Them Right
A reference list is a list of everything you read and quoted/paraphrased/summarised from in your work. Your assignments are more likely to have a reference list at the end as they are short pieces of work.
A bibliography is generally for bigger pieces of work, for dissertations and major projects. It includes everything you read as background reading in preparation for writing your work as well as everything you read and quoted/paraphrased/summarised from in your work.
You should start creating your reference list or bibliography as you go along when you start writing. As soon as you enter your in-text citation, you should scroll down to the bottom of your work and complete your reference list entry as well. If you do not do it immediately, you may forget it and your in-text citations and reference list entries may not match. See here for how your citations and reference list should match (requires logging in).
NOTE: You can use automation whenever available to create your reference list entries (in Library Search, Zotero, MS Word, and others); but always check the output to make sure it complies with the University referencing guide Cite Them Right Harvard-no et al. (meaning, you cannot use et al. in your your reference list entry; you have to list all the authors). Make the necessary corrections if the automated referencing is not what it should be.
Sample referencing practice using Cite Them Right
Get the details of the resource
Let us say you want to use and reference the book Quality management for organizational excellence: introduction to total quality in your work. If you have the print book, you can get all the information necessary to reference this book from the first few pages of it (not the front cover): from the title page and the back of title page.
You can also get the all the details of the book from Library Search (and even create the reference list entry using the Citation button) if you borrowed the book from our libraries.
The details of the book are:

Author/s: David L. Goetsch and Stanley B. Davis
Edition: Eighth edition
Place of publication: London
Publisher: Pearson
Publication or copyright date: 2016
Go to the guide and find the correct category in the guide
This is a print book with two authors and it is in its eight edition. Now you need to find the correct section in the referencing guide that is going to show you how to reference this book:
- Log in to the online Cite Them Right guide and choose your style as Harvard, or use the print guide
- Find the correct category for the resource you want to reference, in this case, it is Books/Printed books/Books with two or three authors (also look at other examples to see how the edition statement is done).
Follow the rules and examples given in the guide
So, if you quote something in your work from page 50 of this book, your in-text citation in the body of your work is going to be:
- (Surname and Surname, year of publication, page number)
- (Goetsch and Davis, 2016, p. 50)
And your reference list entry at the bottom of your work is going to be:
- Surname, Initial. and Surname, Initial. (Year of publication) Title. Edition. Place of publication: Publisher.
- Goetsch, D.L. and Davis, S.B. (2016) Quality management for organizational excellence: introduction to total quality. 8th edn. London: Pearson.
NOTE: You can also go to the book details at Quality management for organizational excellence: introduction to total quality and simply press the ""CITATION"" button under the details to create the reference list entry automatically (make sure Harvard Cite Them Right-No et al is selected on the left). You may need to make some corrections when you create your reference list entries automatically and you always have to create the in-text citation yourself.
Referencing Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a frequently used tool all over the world in every field. You may use tools such as ChatGPT to help you with your studies either to get started or as part of your work provided you do so within the guidelines of the University: that is, AI can assist you, but cannot do your work for you.
If you are using generative AI in your work, always check with your lecturers on how they want transparency of use. As well as referencing, this may include a signed declaration of generative AI usage and/or an appendix of generative AI prompts and outputs.
Notes for Referencing Generative AI
- Transparency is key: Always acknowledge the use of AI tools in your work.
- Output type matters: Specify whether you are referencing the tool itself, the output it generated, or both.
- Adapt UoS guidance: Always cross-check against Cite Them Right (and select your correct referencing style Harvard for your work) as citation styles may update their guidelines for emerging technologies.
- Fact check all AI outputs: Generative AI is predicting results based on the information you put in to it and its stored data; it does NOT know and is not always accurate. Do not rely on Generative AI for research purposes.
How do we reference Generative AI?
There are two types of generative AI: ones that are publicly available and ones that are personal to you.
- If the generative AI material is available online and everyone can access it, reference it as an electronic version of a source (same as referencing a report or an article).
- If the AI’s end product (for example, use of ChatGPT in conversation) is only available to you, reference it as a personal communication and include a description of the AI generated material in your in-text citation. Consult your lecturer in case they require you to provide a copy of the AI work as an appendix to your work.
If you are using generative AI in your work and want to reference it, please follow the Cite Them Right Harvard referencing rules on how to reference generative AI in your work (requires logging in).
Sample Referencing using Cite Them Right
Referencing the AI created material publicly available online:
- Creator (name of AI)
- Year (in parentheses)
- Title of work (in italics)
- [Medium]
- Available at: DOI or URL (Accessed: date)
Referencing AI-generated personal communication:
- Name of AI
- Year of communication (in parentheses)
- Medium of communication
- Receiver of communication
- Day/month of communication
Your personal research and referencing assistants
There are several research and reference managers that can help you collect, organise, annotate, and reference your research data. Here are some of them:
- Zotero: Zotero is a free tool to help you collect, organise, annotate, cite, and share research. It is designed to store, manage, and cite bibliographic references, such as books and articles. Zotero is a tool for collecting and organizing research information and sources.
- Mendeley: Mendeley is free as well. You can add papers directly from your browser with a few clicks or import any documents from your desktop. Access your library from anywhere, Windows, Mac, Linux and all browsers. You can also generate references, citations and bibliographies in a whole range of journal styles with just a few clicks.
- EndNote: EndNote is the reference manager that helps you save time formatting citations, so you can focus on your research. The basic online version of EndNote is free.

Assessment Glossary
Here is a useful 'Glossary of Assessment' that can help guide you in some of the terminology used at UCA.
- Unit: Self-contained elements of study with defined learning objectives, contributing to a course.
- Assessment Component: Activities undertaken by students to assess the extent to which learning objectives of a unit are met.
- Assessment Criteria: Descriptions of what a student is expected to do to demonstrate that learning outcomes have been achieved.
- Credit / Credit Volume: Numerical value denoting the amount of learning expected for a student to achieve the outcomes of a unit.
- Credit Level: Reflects the depth of learning and intellectual demand required to meet the learning outcomes.
- Resit: Opportunity for reassessment without attendance, usually completed before the start of the next academic year.
- Defer: Postponing an assessment attempt due to mitigating circumstances, allowing assessment as if for the first time.
- Enrol/Register: Processes of joining a course (enrol) and a unit (register) at UCA.
- Retake: Reassessment of an entire unit with attendance in the following academic year, including previously passed components.
- Progression: Movement from one stage to the next in a course, subject to meeting credit requirements.
- Stage: The period of study leading to a formal progression or award point.
- Moderation: A quality assurance process where a sample of student work is reviewed to ensure consistency and fairness in marking and grading practices across different assessors and units.
- Sampling: The selection of a representative subset of student work from a larger cohort for the purpose of moderation or validation, ensuring the assessment process's integrity and consistency.
- Internal Verification: A quality assurance process used at UCA to ensure the reliability and consistency of assessment decisions within the university. This process involves a thorough review of assessment tasks, marking schemes, and the grading of student work by internal staff members. The purpose is to confirm that assessment criteria are applied consistently in the marking of students work, and that the assessment process is fair, valid, and aligned with UCA's academic standards. Internal verification may involve blind double marking, sample marking, cross-marking or moderation [see the level 7 CCF/Taught Course Regulations for more details].
- External Verification: A process involving external experts reviewing the assessment and verification procedures on a course to ensure they align with external standards and requirements. This process typically includes the examination of a sample of student work, assessment tasks, and verification records. External verifiers, who are professionals or academics from other institutions or relevant industries, provide an objective assessment of whether UCA's internal verification and overall assessment practices meet the expected criteria of external accreditation bodies, industry standards, or national educational benchmarks.
- Learning Objective: A specific, measurable statement detailing the desired outcome of student learning for a unit or course, guiding the design of curriculum and assessments at UCA.
- Mitigating Circumstances: Factors outside of a student's control that may negatively impact their performance in assessments, considered by UCA when reviewing assessment results.
At UCA we view assessment as a holistic process that extends beyond measuring academic progress to nurturing creative practice, innovation and experimentation, research and analysis and communication and connectivity within create communities. Embedded through these principles is an unwavering commitment to continually improve the way we enhance diversity and inclusivity within our assessment framework. UCA’s assessments are transparent, equitable, and supportive, providing students with valuable feedback to encourage continuous improvement.
Here are some helpful links to UCA policies, procedures and forms used for assessment:
Assessment Policy The Assessment Policy 2022/23 document outlines the university's approach to student assessments, covering principles of assessment, assurance of academic standards, conduct of assessments, grading, feedback mechanisms, and the security of assessment information. Additionally, it includes specific guidelines on various assessment methods, including portfolio assessments, and addresses requirements for courses linked with professional or statutory bodies.
Feedback forms
This cover sheet must be completed and submitted with all work including essays, Dissertations and practical work (with the exception of oral assessments).
Students must receive a separate Assessment Feedback Form for each assessment component of each unit.
Grading Descriptors
The UCA Grading Descriptors provide a structured and detailed framework to assess student work, ensuring consistency and fairness in grading across all courses at UCA.
- Students can use these descriptors to self-assess their work and understand areas for improvement.
- They can be a guide for setting academic and professional goals throughout the course.
- Helps students understand the feedback from tutors in the context of these descriptors.
- Students and tutors can use these descriptors to track progress over time, ensuring that all essential skills and knowledge areas are being developed.
- Level 3 Grading Descriptors
- Level 4 Grading Descriptors
- Level 5 Grading Descriptors
- Level 6 Grading Descriptors
- Postgraduate Taught Course Regulations (PG TCR) 2024/25
- Level 7 Grading Descriptors
The UCA Level 7 Common Credit Framework (CCF) is a set of regulations that apply to taught courses leading to postgraduate awards at UCA. The document covers course award alignment, information on units, credits, course stages, assessment and progression.

This UAL guide highlights how you eliminate inequality from formative assessment practices.
Social Justice
Social justice in higher education refers to the efforts and practices aimed at ensuring equity, fairness, and inclusivity within universities. It involves mitigating systemic inequalities that affect marginalised groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, disability, and other identities.
When exploring a social justice model through our teaching, we can be mindful of;
An inclusive curriculum and pedagogy
Developing curricula that reflect diverse perspectives and histories, and implementing teaching methods that recognise and respect the varied learning styles and experiences of students. This includes:
- Incorporating diverse voices in academic content.
- Promoting critical thinking about power structures, inequality, and justice.
- Ensuring faculty are trained in inclusive teaching practices.
Ensuring diverse representation
Increasing the representation of diverse students, faculty, and staff in higher education institutions. This includes fostering environments where diverse identities are valued and celebrated, rather than marginalised. Measures could include:
- Recruiting faculty and leadership from diverse backgrounds.
- Supporting affinity groups and networks for minority students and faculty.
- Promoting diversity in decision-making processes.
Supportive campus climate
Creating a campus culture that is inclusive, respectful, and supportive of all students, especially those from marginalised groups. This can include:
- Addressing incidents of discrimination, bias, or harassment.
- Implementing policies that promote mental health, well-being, and safety for all students.
- Supporting programs that foster understanding and collaboration among different groups.
Addressing systemic barriers
Recognising and dismantling structural inequalities that exist within the higher education system itself. This can involve:
- Challenging policies and practices that perpetuate inequality.
- Conducting regular assessments of institutional policies to ensure they promote fairness.
- Promoting accountability and transparency in addressing issues related to racism, sexism, ableism, and other forms of discrimination.
Economic justice
Tackling the financial barriers that disproportionately affect students from lower-income backgrounds. This includes:
- Exploring avenues to increase financial accessibility for students, such as enhancing scholarships, bursaries, and funding support.
- Supporting affordable housing, food security, and access to technology.
- Ensuring fair wages and working conditions for student workers and adjunct faculty.
Activism and advocacy
Encouraging students, faculty, and staff to engage in social justice advocacy both on and off-campus. Universities often serve as spaces for social movements and change, providing platforms for dialogue and action on societal issues.
Social justice in higher education aims not only to improve access to education for all but to transform the educational environment so that it serves as a space for fostering critical consciousness and creating more equitable, just societies.
The term ""awarding gap"" in the context of UK higher education refers to disparities in academic outcomes between different groups of students. Specifically, it focuses on differences in degree attainment, classifications, and honours achieved by students from various demographic backgrounds, such as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and disability.
The awarding gap is a subset of the broader issue of educational attainment gaps, reflecting disparities in success rates at the end of a course of study. The concern arises when there are noticeable differences in the proportion of students from different demographic groups who achieve the highest degree classifications (e.g., first-class honours or upper-second-class honours).
You can find more information on awarding gaps here:
Office for Students (OfS)
Since January 2022, the OfS in the UK has been actively engaged in addressing issues related to awarding gaps and promoting equality in higher education. The OfS is responsible for regulating and overseeing higher education providers in England. It places a strong emphasis on ensuring that all students, regardless of their background, have equal opportunities for success and are not disadvantaged by systemic barriers.
The OfS has set expectations for higher education providers to actively address and eliminate disparities in degree outcomes. They have encouraged institutions to take a data-driven approach to identify and understand awarding gaps, considering factors such as ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic background, and disability.

The UCA policy on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is embedded in UCA’s academic quality assurance programme. All academic course teams are required to reflect upon ESD in relation to their courses in preparation for course validation and periodic review.
Education for Sustainable Development empowers learners to take informed decisions and responsible actions for environmental integrity, economic viability, and a just society, for present and future generations, while respecting cultural diversity. It is about lifelong learning and is an integral part of quality education. ESD is holistic and transformational education which addresses learning content and outcomes, pedagogy, and the learning environment. It achieves its purpose by transforming society. (UNESCO, 2019)
In late 2022 academic programme directors mapped the content of each course against the United Nations seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). All courses have taught content that engages students on issues relevant to the SDGs, including for example, equality and diversity, climate change and sustainable resource consumption and production. The mapping exercise is ongoing, and the findings will be used to track the how ESD is embedded across the curriculum.
In 2021 UCA’s Business School for the Creative Industries signed up to the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME), where learning will focus on the UN PRME’ s six key principles; purpose, values, method, research, partnership and dialogue, with an emphasis on ethics, inclusivity and sustainability in business.
In 2021/22 the University’s School of Fashion & Textiles (SoFT) launched the UK’s first degree course in digital fashion. The MA Digital Fashion, which commenced in September 2021, is a response to the environmental concerns of fast fashion and the significant market growth in online virtual fashion, through virtual and augmented reality, social media and gaming, where garments are designed for the virtual world.
In October 2019, UCA became one of the founder partners in the BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) Albert sustainable education partnership.
Albert brings the UK screen industries together to tackle their environmental impact and inspire sustainable living: reducing the impact of the production process and being the vehicle for positive environmental change.
UCA’s School of Film, Media and Performing Arts has adopted Albert’s ‘Applied Skills for a Sustainable Screen Industry’ module, which was introduced to provide students with the opportunity to understand sustainability and its professional and personal relevance. The module also aims to equip graduates with the skills to support the industry’s sustainability transition once they are working within it. This year is the third year that graduates of the BA TV production have been accredited by BAFTA as Albert graduates, with 89% of students achieving Albert Graduate certification.
Students are also able to access the Industry Carbon Calculator to work towards achieving an Albert footprint certification for their work, which demonstrates that the environmental impact of their productions have been monitored and measures have been taken to manage and reduce impact.
Decolonising the curriculum in higher education involves critically reassessing and restructuring teaching materials, methods, and institutional practices to address and dismantle the dominance of Western, Eurocentric perspectives. We are seeking to recognise, value, and integrate knowledge systems, voices, and experiences from marginalised communities. The aim is to create a more inclusive and equitable educational environment that reflects a diversity of worldviews, while challenging the legacies of colonialism and systemic racism.
Here are some key strategies to decolonise the curriculum in higher education:
Critically analyse existing curriculum:
- Question dominant narratives: Review the current curriculum to identify Eurocentric or Western-centric biases and narratives. Analyse whose perspectives are being prioritised and whose voices are excluded or marginalised.
- Diversify Perspectives: Ensure that the curriculum includes perspectives from various cultures, especially those from colonised and historically oppressed communities. Incorporate works and ideas from non-Western practitioners and thinkers.
Broaden the focus beyond Eurocentrism:
- Critically engage with the Western canon, incorporating diverse perspectives: While these contributions are important, it’s essential to de-centre them by incorporating diverse perspectives and challenging the assumption that Western knowledge is universal or superior.
- Reframe historical narratives: Colonial history is often taught from the perspective of colonisers, while the experiences of colonised people are marginalised. Decolonising history involves reframing narratives to reflect the experiences, resistance, and agency of colonised peoples.
Engage with students’ lived experiences:
- Acknowledge students’ identities: Incorporate and validate the diverse lived experiences of students. Encourage students to draw on their own cultural backgrounds and experiences in their learning and academic contributions.
- Culturally responsive pedagogy: Use teaching methods that recognise students’ cultural backgrounds as strengths. This involves creating spaces where students feel empowered to share their perspectives and see them reflected in the content.
Promote critical pedagogy:
- Encourage critical thinking about Power and Colonialism: Engage students in critically examining how colonialism, racism, and other forms of oppression shape knowledge production.
- Empower student voices: Promote student-led inquiry and learning, allowing students to shape the curriculum and engage in discussions about decolonisation. This fosters critical awareness and agency in addressing colonial legacies.
Rethink teaching methods and practices:
- Collaborative and participatory learning: Decolonised pedagogy often moves away from hierarchical teaching methods. Instead of teacher-centred learning, promote collaborative and participatory methods, where knowledge is co-constructed with students.
- Acknowledge multiple learning styles: Recognise and adapt to diverse ways of knowing and learning, particularly those that may not align with Western academic conventions. For example, some cultures emphasise storytelling, community-based learning, and experiential knowledge.
Reassess evaluation and assessment methods:
- Critique standardised assessments: Consider incorporating diverse assessment methods that recognise different ways of knowing, such as oral presentations, projects, or community-engaged work.
- Foster reflexivity: Encourage both faculty and students to reflect on their positionalities—how their cultural backgrounds and identities influence their understanding of knowledge and learning. This practice helps to create more inclusive learning environments.
Connect curriculum with social justice:
- Link local and global struggles: Draw connections between local issues of inequality and broader global struggles against colonialism and imperialism. This helps students see how historical colonialism affects contemporary social, political, and economic conditions.
- Encourage activism and engagement: Support students in applying what they learn about decolonisation to engage in activism and advocacy, both on campus and in their communities.
Continuously evaluate and evolve:
- Ongoing process: Decolonisation is not a one-time task but a continuous process. As educators we should regularly revisit and reassess curricula, teaching practices, and challenge policies to ensure they are progressing toward a decolonised education system.
Decolonising the curriculum requires a deep, ongoing commitment to dismantling systemic inequalities and ensuring that education reflects a multiplicity of perspectives, particularly those historically excluded from academic spaces. It is an essential step toward achieving social justice and equity in higher education.
Please watch UCA's symposium on 'Exploring Social Justice in Creative Higher Education'. Discussions included discussions around awarding gaps, sustainability, the LGBTQIA+ community, supporting students with disabilities, neurodivergence and trauma informed pedagogies. You can find a link to this symposium here.

Using Digital Technologies
This guide has been constructed by Anna Whittle and Matthew Drury and has been edited down by the Creative Education team. For a more comprehensive version please head over to this link where you will find lots more detailed technical guides on myUCA as a teaching tool such as setting up pages, organising the teaching space and course material, adding content, and much more.
myUCA is UCA’s Virtual Learning environment (VLE). Blackboard is our VLE provider, myUCA is the branding that we have given to Blackboard here at UCA. We use myUCA for a variety of reasons but primarily it is used for the following:
- Delivering and organising teaching content.
- Interaction, communication, and collaboration.
- Links to essential resources.
- Assessment, submissions, marking and feedback
All staff are given access to myUCA when first joining UCA. Your username and password will be the same details as for your email and other UCA logins. Your manager should set you up with your access for courses and units but if you require any additional access to courses and units you can contact us at mycoursehelp@. Google Chrome is the preferred Internet browser for working with myUCA.
Each course at UCA has a main course area on myUCA. The main course area will contain all current students on this course regardless of their year. This area is not used for assignment submission or feedback. It is a community area for all students enrolled on your course. Each unit within your course will have a unit area in myUCA, they are easily identified as the title begins with a code (e.g. FFCP4120). Unit areas are where the majority of teaching information is held including teaching materials, assessments, feedback, and reading lists.
Within the courses and organisations pages, you can search, filter and favourite, which will pin courses to the top of the page. You can also change the layout to show either as a list or tiles. Any courses which you have access to will be listed under 'Current Courses'. You can use the drop-down list to select the courses for a specific academic year.
Marks provides you with a centralised view of grades for your courses including the average grades, what needs grading and submission progress. You can gain all this information without having to go into the courses individually. Students can use this area to access Marks and Feedback for all their units.
Setup for new units
All units in myUCA are created new each academic year from the same template to create a consistent experience for students, and to help you meet the Minimum Benchmark Requirements for all myUCA courses. The template contains the recommended setup and organisation for your units and course areas.
The image below shows an example of what your units will look like when they are first created based off the template. Highlighted in blue are the sections you will need to edit to customise your unit area. The guides below will take you through the steps and how to populate and adapt the area to fit the needs of your course.
All units in myUCA are created new each academic year from the same template. The template contains the recommended setup and organisation for your units and course areas. Once the template units are created, you can then customise them for your course. The setup guide will take you through the necessary steps to customise your units before the beginning of term. Once you have completed setup customisation for your unit, you are ready to start adding content.
These are some of the more frequently used tips for myUCA. For a more comprehensive guide to these and adding content to your course pages, please follow this link.
This guide has been constructed by Anna Whittle and Matthew Drury and has been edited down by the Creative Education team. For a more comprehensive version please head over to this link where you will find lots more detailed technical guides on Panopto as a teaching tool.
Panopto is a video recording, organising, editing and sharing tool that is designed specifically for educational purposes. Panopto is already integrated with myUCA; each course and unit has its own Panopto folder ready for you to add or record video content into.
How to access Panopto
All staff and students at UCA are automatically given a Panopto account. You can access your home folder for Panopto directly here or access your Panopto account through any of your course or unit areas by clicking the 'Panopto Video' icon in the content area. This will take you directly through to that unit's Panopto Folder.
You can then choose whether to use Panopto within myUCA or you can select the pop out icon in the top right hand corner and use Panopto within a designated browser window:
For more guidance this link will take you through a general overview for Instructors of how to navigate and use Panopto within your courses and units in myUCA (Blackboard).

For a more comprehensive version please head over to this link where you will find lots more detailed technical guides on assessment through digital tools such as Turnitin, Blackboard assignments, Panopto video assignments, digitising work for physical hand in, and much more.
myUCA
Where possible, all assessment submissions should be set up within myUCA. This ensures that all submissions are automatically archived within myUCA for the required period of time and creates a singular point of contact where students can locate their submission boxes, marks and feedback. There are many assessment tools available to you within myUCA to suit a variety of assessment needs. Which assessment tool you decide to use will most likely depend on the type of file the students will be submitting and the type of task set:
In the majority of cases, your Course Administrator can assist you with setting up your submission boxes, assessments, feedback release, and marks in myUCA. However, all instructors can set up their own assessment areas within myUCA as well. For more in depth guidance on how to do this, please follow this link, which will give you a detailed description of each assessment tool and how to set them up in myUCA.
For a brief guide on this, please continue to read. .
Turnitin
A Turnitin box is the best option for submissions that will be mainly text based and need checking for plagiarism such as essays and reports.
Turnitin is a web-based plagiarism prevention submission programme used by most universities in the UK. Turnitin compares text within a student's submission against an archive of internet documents, internet data, a repository of previously submitted papers, periodicals, journals, and publications and provides a similarity report and score for the submission.
At UCA we use Turnitin to:
- Act as a deterrent against plagiarism.
- Provide reports which can help identify occurrences of plagiarism.
- Provide students with a tool to identify and correct possible occurrences of plagiarism in their own work and improve their academic writing.
Requirements for Turnitin submissions:
- Text based Submissions
- Minimum 20 words.
- PDF, Word Document, PowerPoint
- Under 100Mb
Blackboard Assignments:
The Blackboard Assignment tool is the most versatile submission tool as it allows students to submit any type of file as well as multiple files. It has a large upper file size limit of 2.56 GB. The Blackboard Assignment tool is the best assessment option for submissions that will not require text plagiarism checking such as image based content, portfolios.
Blackboard Assignment submissions:
- Any file type accepted
- Multiple files can be accepted
- Large file size limit of 2.56 GB
- Cannot check for plagiarism - Not recommended for text-based submissions.

As outlined on the Malpractice page, when you submit work for assessment, you are required to include a declaration that you have followed these guidelines and that the work is your own, including a bibliography and references that show how you have used the work of others. The material referenced must include everything you have used, for example words, images, film or audio found in printed books and journals, content accessed online, material generated by any online service or Artificial Intelligence, and information received through personal contacts (such as interviews and surveys).
University of Cumbria regulations define malpractice as:""as any attempt by a student to gain an unfair advantage in assessment... includes all forms of cheating, plagiarism, collusion, fabrication and falsification and impersonation”.
The main types of malpractice outlined within the University’s regulations include:
- Cheating in examinations
- Plagiarism
- Collusion with other students in coursework
- Fabrication and falsification
- Presenting for assessment content generated through artificial intelligence as your own
- Impersonation including the use of essay mills or ghost writing services, or having work written by friends or family
Cite them Right Online defines plagiarism as: “Taking and using another person's thoughts, writings or inventions as your own without acknowledging or citing the source of the ideas and expressions. In the case of copyrighted material, plagiarism is illegal.”
University Procedures and Processes for Academic Malpractice 5.2.1 say: ""Plagiarism consists of unacknowledged use of someone else’s work and attempting to pass it off as one’s own. It includes the representation of work: written, visual, practical or otherwise, of any other person, including another student or anonymous web-based material, or any institution, as the candidate’s own.""
Generative Artificial Intelligence
A recent area of development is the availability of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Google Bard. There may be legitimate uses of generative AI in your subject area and you can discuss these with your tutors. Guidance on how to cite and reference legitimate uses of generative AI is now available via Cite them Right online.
Generative AI tools should be used with caution as there are serious limitations to some of the content they generate currently, such as drawing on biased, inaccurate sources and making up references that don't exist.
Using AI to generate work that is submitted for assessment without any acknowledgement and against any directives from tutors, is a form of malpractice. Where it is suspected that AI has been used when it shouldn’t have, or it has not been credited through appropriate referencing, the standard University academic malpractice procedures will be used.
As this is a constantly evolving and complex area, please visit our dedicated webpage: Generative Artificial Intelligence.
Contract cheating
Contract cheating involves students paying money to companies (often called essay mills) for an assignment written by someone else and students then submitting this work as their own. These companies deliberately target and befriend students, eg via social media platforms, sometimes adopting University colours and branding to appear legitimate. These companies have been known to extort further money from students and graduates by threatening to contact universities, employers and professional bodies.
Watch this video about the serious consequences of contract cheating: Academic Integrity and Contract Cheating
Essentially, if you submit an assignment written by someone else or generated by something else, it is malpractice. This has serious consequences, not just for your university studies, but potentially for your life beyond university as well.
Academic integrity means graduating with pride
Very few students set out to try to cheat their way to a qualification. Some find themselves struggling for all sorts of reasons and start to believe that the only way out is something like an essay mill or a bot. If you are finding assignments challenging, feeling overwhelmed by deadlines, or something is happening for you that might make you vulnerable to malpractice, seek support. Don't take a step you'll later regret, talk to someone. This might be a friend, family member, tutor, the skills@cumbria team, the Student Union. If you're not sure who to talk to, make a self referral via the Student Enquiry Point. You're not on your own.

University's Academic Misconduct information.
Point 7 of the University's Academic Misconduct information specifies that ""London Metropolitan University Students will be expected, when required, to document or reference their use of Generative AI for assessment submissions"".
You should always document or acknowledge any use of AI, even if you didn't directly use the AI generated content. For example, if you used AI in the development of ideas and concepts in your work, you must still acknowledge that.
Check with your tutor if you are allowed to use AI for any part of your assignment from gathering initial ideas, using the produced output, structuring a report or essay or summarising content etc.
How?
Provide a description of the AI tool used, how the information was generated, including the prompts you used, and the date accessed. You could add this acknowledgement as a footnote or at the end of your reference list, but you should check with the course coordinator or tutor for guidance.
Format:
I acknowledge the use of [insert AI system(s) with link] to [how the AI was used]. The prompts or questions/sub-questions used include [list of prompts].
Example:
I acknowledge the use of Copilot [ to generate ideas and material for background research and project planning in the drafting of this assignment.

It is a serious offense that can have severe consequences. One key action to avoid is copying and pasting. See the information about editing below. Although generative AI presents many advantages, there are also risks associated with plagiarism. Some useful strategies to avoid plagiarism in this context include:
Citing your sources
Make sure to properly cite and attribute any material or ideas you combine from outside sources. Since published information may be generated by AI tools, it is imperative to provide credit to the original authors. Depending on the kind of content, use the appropriate citation required by the referencing style. Citation may not be necessary when utilising AI tools to improve original content.
Verifying information
Texts produced by AI may convey information that is unoriginal or contains factual errors, making it imperative to verify its correctness and dependability before using it in your work. By independently reviewing reliable sources to confirm the facts, figures, and assertions generated by AI tools, this will ensure the information presented is reliable and trustworthy.
Editing
Once you've used an AI tool, make sure the text produced will accurately reflect your original meaning and style by carefully reviewing and editing it. Rewrite sentences, add personal observations, and make the required changes to prevent accidental plagiarism.

Abstract
When students submit written assignments for assessment, they are generally trusted to have completed these honestly, and to have benefitted from the opportunity to learn. Academic integrity breaches are sometimes detected during the assessment process. Some common examples of integrity breaches during students’ academic writing include contract cheating, the unauthorised use of GenAI technology for completing assignments, and using AI tools to disguise existing work so that it appears to be original. None of these are new phenomena. Processes and procedures should be in place for managing suspected academic misconduct cases detected during the assessment process. But what happens when academic misconduct is detected retrospectively, sometimes after a student has moved degree programmes or graduated?
This position paper sets out the case for universities and other academic institutions having procedures in place to deal with historic academic misconduct. It provides examples of how institutions can become aware of misconduct, including through whistleblowing and through development of more effective detection software. The authors bring together legal and educational expertise to suggest considerations that individual institutions should make towards future policy development. The discussion considers that students must be supported and prepared for success, but that institutions cannot ignore the reputational risks associated with cases of historic misconduct.

Highlights
- Our Criminology courses are ranked first in the North West of England for teaching quality and student experience for the second year running by The Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide 2022.
- Also, The Complete University Guide 2022 ranks us second in the UK and first in England for student satisfaction for Sociology (which includes our Crime and Criminal Justice courses).
- Our academic staff come from a diverse range of professional criminal justice backgrounds. They’ll support you to develop and enhance relevant competencies in evidence-based practice and apply them to your chosen area of criminal justice.
- We work closely with organisations such as the College of Policing, the Crown Prosecution Service, Public Health England, the Home Office, and Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service, ensuring our course offers a truly holistic view of crime and criminal justice in the UK and fosters a culture of multi-disciplinary working and information sharing between agencies.
- The course covers two of the four knowledge modules required by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) as prerequisites for Probation Officer training. If you have not yet completed the other two required areas of knowledge, it may be possible to complete these are stand-alone professional development modules here at the University of Bolton. We’ll also encourage you to gain the relevant experience necessary, and can advise and support you as you approach potential placement providers.

Teaching and learning on our BA (Hons) Crime and Criminal Justice course is supported by a variety of methods. You can expect lectures, seminars, workshops, practical role play and direct study.

An essential element of assessment at Honours level is your dissertation – an in-depth research report that allows you to showcase your critical understanding of theoretical models and contemporary literature relevant to a specific area of thought or practice. Overall, some assessments will contribute to your final module mark and allow you to demonstrate that you’ve met the learning outcomes, while others are designed to help you identify areas that need extra attention on your part, or where you need extra support from your tutors.

Most undergraduate students will have completed further education studies in the form of A-levels, BTECs or equivalent qualifications.
You're an undergraduate student if you are studying for your first degree - usually a Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc). Undergraduate degrees provide a grounding in a subject and typically last for three years, however it's also possible to study for an accelerated degree over two years, which includes a mandatory paid work placement.
Find out more about the different types of degrees.
If you don’t have the grades for your chosen degree, or if you’re not sure what you’d like to study, a foundation year gives you an alternative route into studying for an undergraduate degree.
This is an extra year that gives you the opportunity to learn more about the subject before moving on to the full degree. It’s a direct path on to an undergraduate degree and will provide you with the necessary skills for the course.
Find out more about our foundation years.
Applications to enrol on an undergraduate degree are made through UCAS.
Postgraduate
Postgraduate courses cover higher-level study, including master's degrees, doctorates (PhDs) and postgraduate diplomas. These typically require you to have completed an undergraduate degree, often with 2:2 honours or higher, before you can study them.
Types of master’s degree include:
- MSc (Master of Science)
- MA (Master of Arts)
- MEd (Master of Education)
- LLM (Master of Law)
- LLM (Master of Law) Top-up
- MBA (Master of Business Administration)
- MRes (Masters by Research)
- PGDip (Postgraduate Diploma)
- MPhil (Master of Philosophy)
- PhD (Doctor of Philosophy)
What is a master’s degree?
A master’s degree is the most common type of academic postgraduate qualification following an undergraduate degree. Depending on the subject and study content, it can be classified in a variety of ways including as an MA, MSc, MBA, MRes, or LLM. It can be taught, research based (MRes) or a combination of the two. Some programmes are studied ‘in person’, others may be via distance-learning. All are designed to enable the development of in-depth knowledge and expertise in a particular subject. Most, though not all, master’s courses require you to write an in-depth thesis, or conduct a personal research project. Master’s qualifications are often studied full-time over 12 months, but some can be studied part-time over two years. Undertaking a master’s generally requires more independent study and personal commitment than studying an undergraduate programme.
What is a postgraduate diploma?
A postgraduate diploma, sometimes written as a PGDip, PgDIP, or PG Dip, is at the same academic level as a master’s degree, but is a third shorter. This is because it generally doesn’t include the final research project required by a master’s. Postgraduate diplomas are suitable for those wanting something straight after their undergraduate studies and for professionals seeking to enhance their skills or move into a particular profession. Because it is shorter than a master’s degree, it can be an excellent option for those who don’t have the financial means to pay for a master’s.
What is a postgraduate top-up?
If you decide to pursue a short postgraduate qualification such as a PGDip and then to continue your studies, you may achieve a master’s qualification by studying an academic postgraduate ‘top up’. Usually a full-time semester-long qualification, successful completion can lead to a full master’s qualification (if you pass all the necessary academic requirements).
What is postgraduate research?
An MPhil or PhD are typically undertaken after studying a master’s degree. An MPhil is an advanced master's based on research, taking from 18 months to four years. An MPhil can be a standalone qualification or be used to continue onto a PhD. PhDs can take from three to four years full-time or seven years part-time. They require students to conduct independent research in their specialist subject area, which will be considered as original research, worthy of publication in an academic journal or book.
You do not have to study for a postgraduate qualification immediately after finishing your bachelor's degree. Many people opt for further study after they have begun working in their chosen field, particularly if it could enhance their career prospects, or if they wish to move into or specialise in a particular area of work.

Prompt question: How does Wittgenstein explain the definition of a game?
AI output in full:
Ludwig Wittgenstein, an influential philosopher of the 20th century, addresses the concept of the definition of a game in his philosophical work ""Philosophical Investigations."" In this work, Wittgenstein challenges the traditional approach to defining concepts and argues that definitions are not always straightforward and rigid. Instead, he proposes a more flexible understanding of language and meaning.
Wittgenstein begins by examining how we typically define things by pointing out their common features. For example, when we define a game, we might list attributes such as competition, rules, and amusement. However, Wittgenstein argues that there is no single defining characteristic that encompasses all games. Instead, he suggests that games have a ""family resemblance"" in which different games share overlapping similarities without any one feature being present in all of them.
To illustrate this idea, Wittgenstein uses the concept of a ""language game."" Language games are social activities where language is used for specific purposes, such as giving commands, describing objects, or telling jokes. He suggests that the rules of language games are not fixed or universally applicable but are shaped by their context and usage.
Similarly, Wittgenstein argues that games have a set of related activities, which may have overlapping rules and characteristics, but no single set of features that applies to all games. He emphasizes the importance of looking at the various ways games are played and the different aspects that make them enjoyable or engaging.
According to Wittgenstein, the concept of a game is better understood through a holistic and contextual approach rather than a strict definition based on necessary and sufficient conditions. He encourages us to examine the diverse range of games and explore their connections and similarities, acknowledging that the boundaries between different games can be fuzzy and subject to interpretation.
Overall, Wittgenstein's approach to defining a game involves recognizing that definitions are not fixed and absolute but depend on the context and the way in which language is used in practice. By focusing on the family resemblance of games and the varied activities they encompass, he challenges the notion of a strict definition and highlights the complexity of language and meaning.

Programming Tools
You will identify an opportunity to improve the software production process, devising a tool that will refine developer workflows.
Contexts can vary, but could include utilities for development operations, standalone computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools, debugging extensions for an integrated development environment (IDE), content pipeline automation utilities that leverage generative artificial intelligence, or similar.
You will need to explore contemporary software engineering practice, bringing a critical eye to the day-to-day tasks of developers to identify and articulate the “need” for your proposed tool. You will also need to explore the frameworks and environments of your chosen context so that you can effectively build upon it. To support you in your endeavour, you will receive support with defining and working with application programming interfaces and in the conventions typical of such programming tools. Notably, how to adhere to system standards, license conditions, and platform specifications.
Renewing the focus on the human element of computer systems, you will also consider lessons learned from the literature on user experience design and design science more generally. The tool you build must be deployable, and you must demonstrate that it is fit-for-purpose and compliant with system requirements. You will also need to refactor the architecture of your solution to ensure that it is robust and performant.
Research & Development: Proposal
In this module, you’ll plan and commence an individual ‘major’ research and development project in computing. You can choose to conduct primary research centred on or supported by a novel computing artefact, or practice-based research with significant technical depth.
The development of your written proposal will include identifying an opportunity, critically reviewing relevant literature, setting a hypothesis and designing a mode of data collection, while considering all ethical implications, as well as prototyping a novel and substantial computing artefact.
Research & Development: Dissertation
On this module, you’ll continue your individual ‘major’ research and development project. Building upon the proposal you submitted, you’ll further develop your prototype computing artefact into a potentially deployable solution. In doing so, you’ll deepen your knowledge of software engineering, the use of advanced research tools, technical writing and academic conventions, as well as the interpretation and visualisation of results from statistical analyses of quantitative data.
Under the supervision of a subject-matter expert, you will: realise a novel and substantial computing artefact; execute your research and development; and critically analyse your results, disseminating your findings through a written academic dissertation. You’ll also present your insights to peers alongside a demonstration of the final computing artefact, referring to the potential impact of your project, any ethical concerns, and potential future work.
Digital Innovation
You will develop your commercial awareness and entrepreneurial mindset.
You will consider knowledge and skills that are equally applicable to setting up your own business, establishing yourself as a freelancer, or for use as an employee in a business or organisation. This will help you to further develop your goals, values, and employability skills, as well as to explore options available to you.
You begin by critically evaluating market opportunities, exploring how businesses can operate, and comparing how intellectual property can be managed through granted rights, contract, trade secret, and incorporation. Contexts will vary, but could include products and services across a wide range of digital contexts. You form teams around enterprise opportunities to devise a project proposal. You will then be immersed in practical learning where you identify an opportunity for innovation and develop your own concept through a pre-production process.
Branding, cash flow modelling, enterprise planning, developing intellectual property, and more will feature to culminate towards an investment-style pitch in which you present your proposed product or service.
Major Collaboration
In this module, you’ll leverage your experiences from the prior stages of the course to deliver a substantial collaborative project. You’ll work in a multi-skilled team to design and implement a potentially innovative product or service.
Typically, this will be the continuation of your previous project, but it could also be a newly proposed project that satisfies a real need, a response to a market opportunity identified by the University, a live brief from or collaboration with industry partners or research teams, or a solution to a problem presented by an external stakeholder.
You will continue to put into practice the ethically-informed methodologies you have explored in previous modules. Contexts can also vary but could include: enterprise solutions; mobile apps; installations; games; web applications; robots; immersive experiences; software development tools; and more.

Teaching & Assessment
We use various teaching and learning methods to help you acquire and develop the appropriate skills, concepts and knowledge needed to succeed in your studies. Our blended learning and teaching style includes online delivery and engagement where appropriate.
You'll be expected to attend formally-timetabled classes with tutors, such as lectures, seminars, tutorials, discussions groups, guest speakers and masterclasses. We'll use a combination of live sessions and online and practical work as appropriate. You'll also need to undertake a significant amount of personal study, including activities such as background reading, preparing for seminar activities, working on assignments, and revising for exams.
The assessment strategy aims to help you achieve the overall aims of the programme and the learning outcomes for individual modules. As well as being a way to assess your achievement, the assessments also help you organise and develop your learning. Assessment feedback can help you build skills and understand your strengths and weaknesses.
There are two types of assessment: formative and summative. Formative assessments help you learn and develop your knowledge and skills, while the results of your summative assessments provide your grades. Formative feedback is given face-to-face, online or in written form. Summative assessments tasks are linked to each module's learning outcomes, and you'll need to complete these before the end of the module. Module assessments typically involve written coursework, project work, oral assessments and portfolios. You'll also receive feedback for summative assessment, usually in writing, with the opportunity to receive a more detailed verbal explanation.
If your first degree is not in law or your first language is not English, we strongly encourage you to take International Business Law as your first option. This module will provide you with an overview/foundation in the principles of legal systems.

Harvard is the method by which you acknowledge using someone else’s writing, work, or ideas in your own academic writing while studying at UCA. The Harvard system consists of two main components:
If you use images you will also need to reference them separately using captions and a list of illustrations.
Why is referencing important?
Making sure that you accurately cite and reference the writing, work and/or ideas produced by somebody else is an essential part of academic writing. Here are some reasons why it is so important:
Plagiarism is deliberately or accidentally presenting someone else’s writing, work or ideas as if they are your own. It is also possible to self-plagiarise by submitting an assignment that you have previously submitted at UCA or at another institution. Plagiarism is a very serious offence that can lead to you having to re-submit your work, receiving a zero grade, and, in some situations, being expelled from the university. Harvard referencing correctly is the most important thing you can do to avoid accusations of plagiarism.
Learn more about our Academic Misconduct Regulations, plagiarism, other forms of academic misconduct, and how to avoid them by completing our Academic Integrity Toolkit on myLibrary.
Unintentional plagiarism happens when you do not have a clear understanding of what plagiarism is or how to reference correctly. Common misunderstandings are -
Avoiding Plagiarism
The most effective way to avoid plagiarism is to reference. Referencing consists of citations - which acknowledge the work and ideas of others and a bibliography, or in the case of images - list of illustrations, is a complete list of all the citations and their sources you have used. You will need to add citations to your work when you -
You can use Referencing Tools to help you format your citations, bibliography and list of illustrations into the correct referencing style - UCA Harvard.
Turnitin is an online service which helps staff to identify suspected cases of plagiarism. It will compare a submitted assignment with a database of journal articles, books, web pages past and present and previously submitted assignments and will indicate the sources of any matching text which it identifies.
Accessing Turnitin
Turnitin is accessed via myUCA. Log in using your UCA username and password and you will see the ;myCourse home page, which gives you access to your entire course, units and a range of other resources.
Usually Turnitin will be found in the Submit You Work area on myUCA. This will be an option on the left of the unit or course page where you access material relating to the unit you are using Turnitin for.
Your tutor will inform you if you are required to submit an assignment via Turnitin. You will be given an opportunity to try the service to see how it works before the final submission date.

Understanding Turnitin's Similarity Report
The Turnitin Similarity Report highlights matches between your assignment and its database of sources. There can be many reasons for the matches, they do not mean that you have plagiarised as only your tutor can decide that not Turnitin. Reasons for text matches could be that:
Understanding the Similarity Report
A citation is used in the body of your writing to indicate when you have referred to someone else’s writing, work or ideas. Your citations provide some basic information about the sources you used but are intended to link to your bibliography, which contains more detailed information about your sources and how you accessed them.
Your citations have to be written in a particular way but this can change depending on the kind of source you are using, how many authors they have, and how you are integrating them into your work. The citation for most sources consists of the author’s surname, the year of publication and the page number (where applicable) contained within round brackets, and formatted exactly like this:
(Butler, 2006:8)
You should use citations to acknowledge your sources when using direct quotations and when paraphrasing. The rest of this section will address some of the common questions raised on writing citations. If you are placing your citation at the end of a sentence then the full-stop should be placed after the final bracket of your citation, not within the citation.
Quoting someone’s exact words is called a direct quotation and these are placed within double speech marks. The citation normally appears at the end of your quotation, like this:
“whatever biological intractability sex appears to have, gender is culturally constructed” (Butler, 2006:8).
If you include the author’s name in your writing then it is possible to put the citation directly after the surname, like in these examples:
The architect Daniel Libeskind (1997:153) argues that “in representing the making of architecture as an autonomous activity (having more affinity to technique than science) this thinking intentionally narrows itself to a process of date collecting operations.”
David Olusoga (2016:97) states how “those who did escape slavery in Britain, like those who were freed with no trade, education or support, lived lives that were extremely hard.”
If your direct quotation is more than three lines long then it should be indented to stand out from the rest of your writing, like this:
“There is no doubt that machine learning has the power to transform industries, either augmenting humans or replacing them in certain tasks. However, this should not happen until researchers find ways to make algorithms more understandable and, in turn, more accountable” (Fan, 2019:72)
If a quote is too long for your needs you can use a partial quotation instead by removing irrelevant portions of text and replacing the missing parts with three full stops, like in these examples:
“The function of the culture industry is...to organize leisure time in the same way as capitalist industrialization has organised work time. Work under capitalism stunts the senses; the function of the culture industry is to continue the process” (Storey, 2017:11)
“On the contrary we can only understand an effective and dominant culture if we understand the real social process on which it cational institutions are usually the main agencies of the transmission of an effective dominant culture” (Williams, 2005:38-39)
An indirect quotation is when you explain someone’s writing, work or ideas in your own words. This is also known as paraphrasing. There is no need to use double quotation marks but you must still include a citation. Paraphrasing is more complex than changing the occasional word, you must be able to convey the author’s original meaning while summarising or simplifying their writing. For example, here is a direct quotation:
“Of course, if women could subvert so-called masculine traits by adapting and adopting masculine fashions, then it was also possible for men to procure feminine styles for themselves, and, as the century progressed, the cries of ‘gender confusion’ by media and academic commentators became increasingly loud” (Arnold, 2001:101)
This direct quotation could be paraphrased like this:
Increasing discourse surrounding gender emerged as the traditional distinctions between male and female fashion became blurred (Arnold, 2001:101).
Or, like this:
Traditional notions of gender were challenged by women wearing fashions usually intended for men and men wearing fashions usually intended for women (Arnold, 2001:101).
Paraphrasing depends upon your own writing style and vocabulary but it is important that you do not misrepresent the original source and that you remember to acknowledge your source using a citation.
If your source has two authors then you include both names in your citation, like the following examples:
(Ambrose and Harris, 2015:24)
(Harryhausen and Dalton, 2005:116)
If your source has more than two authors then you can write the name of the first author followed by et al., which is an abbreviation of a Latin phrase meaning “and others.” Et al. should be placed in italics. However, please note, you should list all authors in the bibliography:
Citation:
(Clover et al., 2022:15)
Bibliography:
Clover, D. E., Sanford, K. and Harman, K. (2022) Feminism, adult education and creative possibility: imaginative responses. London: Bloomsbury.
To differentiate between multiple works by the same author(s) that are published in the same year, add letters in alphabetical order at the end of the year of publication. The example below shows citations of two works by the same author published in the same year. The first citation in the bibliography has 'a' added after the year, and the second citation in the bibliography has 'b' added after the citation:
(Trafford, 2019a)
(Trafford, 2019b:38)
In your bibliography as the author and the year are the same, the references should be ordered alphabetically by the title.
If you’re using a company name rather than a personal name, this rule still applies:
(Mintel, 2019a)
(Mintel, 2019b)
To differentiate between authors with the same surname you should add the initials of the author to the citation. The addition of initials will avoid any confusion over who you are referencing and will make it easier to find the corresponding entry in your bibliography.
(R. Williams, 2005:99) (G. Williams, 2007:13)
Some books have an overall editor but chapters written by different authors, these are known as edited collections. If you are not sure whether the book you are using is an edited collection, take a look at the table of contents to see whether the they include authors’ names alongside the chapter titles.
When citing a chapter from a book, use the author of the chapter and not the overall editor of the book for your citation. For example, the book Thinking Through Fashion, edited by Agnès Rocamora and Anneke Smelik, contains a chapter called ‘Michel Foucault: fashioning the body politic’ by Jane Tynan. The citation for this example would be: (Tynan, 2016:187)
It is sometimes necessary to cite an author already quoting somebody else, this is sometimes called secondary referencing or an indirect citation. Your tutor may prefer that you use the original source, rather than the work of the person quoting them, so always check with them to be sure.
As an example, Rosalind Gill, in her book Gender and the Media uses the following quote by Judith Williamson:
“it used to be an act of daring on the left to claim enjoyment of Dallas, disco dancing or any other piece of mass popular culture. Now it seems to require equal daring to suggest that such activities, while certainly enjoyable, are not radical” (Williamson, 1986:14)
If you wanted to use this quote in your own writing then your citation would be like this:
(Williamson, 1986:14 cited in Gill, 2007:16)
You use the citation details of the original quote but then use the words “cited in” to indicate the source you got it from. In this instance, the only book you would need to enter in your bibliography would be the one written by Rosalind Gill.
There will be occasions where you need to reference a person who is not the author of a source and where there is no original source. In those instances the format for secondary referencing is appropriate. For example, if you are referencing an interviewee from an interview and the interviewer is the author of the article, or if you are referencing a character in a film or a person in a documentary.
It is better to use the name of a person, where possible, but there are sometimes cases where you can use a company name instead. For example, you may need to do this if using published reports by a company, charity or other organisation when they have not listed a named author, or if you use an article from a website and there is no personal author indicated. Here are some examples:
(Deloitte, 2019:34) (Rolling Stone, 2019:5)
(Kering, 2019) (Refuge, 2018:1)
It is always better to include accurate information in your citations but there may sometimes be situations where there is no author or publication date listed. If you find yourself in this situation, you can use the following abbreviations instead:
If there is no author indicated and it’s not possible to use a company name instead then use s.n. instead, this is a Latin abbreviation for the phrase “without a name”:
(s.n., 2019:43)
If there is no date indicated then use s.d., a Latin abbreviation for the phrase “without a date”:
(Jones, s.d.:32)
It is better to use these sparingly, only when absolutely necessary, because your tutor may question the quality of your sources if you are unable to identify this information.
Films, television programmes and online videos are one of the few exceptions to the usual citation format. Instead of using an author’s name, you simply use the name of the film, television programme or online video (written in italics) and the year it was released, like this:
(Green Book, 2018) (The Red Turtle, 2016)
(HyperNormalisation, 2016) (La Maison en Petits Cubes, 2012)
If you would like to refer to a specific episode in a multi-series television programme then you can include the season and episode number in your citation too:
(Orange is the New Black: Season 5, episode 6, 2017)
(Game of Thrones: Season 3, episode 7, 2013)
If you are citing someone from a film, television progrmme or online video you will need to use the same format as a secondary citaion. This will make it clear who the person you are citing is, and where the idea is from. If you only cite the person your reference won’t link to your bibliography where the film, television programme or online video will be found.
As an example to quote Adam Curtis from the TV programme HyperNormalisation your citation would look like one of these examples:
“the aim was to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt” (Curtis, cited in, HyperNormalisation, 2016)
According to Curtis (cited in, HyperNormalisation, 2016) “the aim was to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt”.
You can refer to multiple authors within the same citation if paraphrasing, this is typically done as part of a literature review. You simply include your citations in the standard format but separate them using a semi-colon. They should all be included with a single set of round brackets, like in this example:
Our notions of gender are culturally constructed (West and Zimmerman, 1987:126; Butler, 2006:8)
A bibliography is a list of all the sources referred to or consulted in order to complete your assignment. Your bibliography must be:
How to write references
Before writing your references, you will need specific bits of information that will vary depending on the kind of source you are using. For all your references you will need to start with the following:
Your references must be written in a particular way, with all the required information placed in the correct order. For example, this is a breakdown of a book reference:
Writing references: the most popular sources
Writing references: other sources
Notes
Author – This is the author of email or person being interviewed. If the person you have interviewed has not given permission for you to use their name in your work, you should anonymise them and give an appropriate title, e.g. Subject, Person, Artist.
Medium of communication– Briefly provide the details of the medium used, e.g. Zoom, email, in-person, etc.
Receiver of communication – This is the person receiving the communication, usually the author who is receiving the email or conducting the interview.
URL - When using an AI tool that provides a shareable URL to your conversation provide the link.
Reference to the appendix (if applicable) – You are usually expected to provide an appendix of raw data or transcripts when carrying out primary research, if you are unsure contact your tutor for advice. If the original email or transcription of the interview appears in your appendix, provide a note with details of where it can be found in the appendix, such as (see Appendix A).
When using images within your written work it is essential that you reference your image sources accurately. This is a very similar process to writing citations and a bibliography for text sources. There are two main components used to reference your images -
The method shown in this guide is the formal method of referencing images based on the Harvard system and is suitable for referencing images used within essays or dissertations. This method is not necessarily suitable for all assignments, such as reports that contain a lot of visual material, so your tutors may recommend a more suitable way of referencing images.
You can refer to, or highlight, images that you’ve included in your written work by writing (See Fig. x), where x is the figure number of the image. Like in this example:
Many of Delacroix’s paintings contain orientalist themes (See Fig. 1)
What is a list of illustrations?
A list of illustrations is a list of all the visual and image sources used in your written assignment. Your list of illustrations must be -
Writing figure numbers and image captions
Each image should have its own figure number and the numbers are allocated by order of appearance. The first image in your written work will be Figure 1, the second will be Figure 2, followed by Figure 3, Figure 4 and so on. You should clip the word Figure to the shortened form, Fig. but remember to include the full stop at the end.
If the image you are using is a named photograph or work of art, you should use that name as its caption. If your image does not have a name, your caption should simply describe what the image is. The caption must be placed in italics.
The year of publication / creation should be placed in round brackets directly after your caption.
You should place the figure number, caption and year of publication directly beneath each image, like in the following example -
Fig. 1 Blank image placeholder (2019)
If you are using Microsoft Word to write your assignment, right-click on an image and select the option to “Insert caption...”. This will allow you to choose where your captions appear, the image label (which you may need to change to display as Fig.) and will automatically update the numbers as you add new images.
How to write your list of illustrations
For each reference in your list of illustrations you will need specific bits of information that will vary depending on the kind of image you are using. You will need to start with the following -
Your list of illustration references must be written in a particular way, with all the required information placed in the correct order. For example, this is the breakdown of a reference for an image found online -

Using an Appendix
Some examples of the types of things that you may want to include in an Appendix:
Formatting your Appendix
An appendix should be placed at the end of your essay or dissertation after your illustration list and bibliography.
If there is more than one appendix label them using letters, e.g. Appendix A, Appendix B. Label and arrange them in the order they are referred to in your text.
Start your appendix on a new page with the title Appendix or Appendices if there is more than one.
Label your Appendix and add a descriptive title. For example:
Appendices
Appendix B: Interview on awareness of fast fashion.
Citing material included in an appendix
Include a citation at the bottom of your appendix if the text or data is not your own. If it is an email, interview or AI conversation this will correspond with a bibliography entry following the Personal communications (Email and interviews) example in this guide.
For example, the full text from an interview may be included in an Appendix. Underneath the text add a citation that references the person being interviewed.
Appendix B: Interview on awareness of fast fashion
Text of interview
(Turner, 2022)
In the bibliography add an entry like this:
Turner, N. (2022) Zoom interview with Bell, A. 22/06/2019. (see Appendix B).
Referring to an appendix in your work (in text)
You can also refer to material in your appendix in your work. If you have a citation, such as for personnal communication, this should appear when you reference the material in your work:
This shows a lack of investment in materials and quality (Turner, 2022).
Turner (2022) stated that this showed a lack of imvestment in materials and quality.
This will also be included in your bibliography (as above)
Turner, N. (2022) Zoom interview with Bell, A. 22/06/2019. (see Appendix B).
You can also refer to material in your appendix that does not have a citation, or it seems clearer to do do. For example, when you are referring to a survey or statistics that you have compiled:
The results for the online survey shows that 80% of respondents were not aware that.... (see Appendix A).
Appendix B reveals that 60% of respondents could not effectively identify the environmental problems created by the fast fashion industry.
Artificial Intelligence
If you have used or referred to information created by an artificial intelligence (AI) tool in your work, you must acknowledge this as a source in your work. The acknowledgement will consist of a citation and a corresponding entry in your Bibliography, and in the case of images, an image caption and a corresponding entry in your List of Illustrations.
There are currently no specific standards for referencing AI, this advice could be subject to change.
To reference AI in your work use templates that exist in UCA Harvard:
Personal Communications (email and interviews)
If you need to reference the text that an AI tool has produced, then cite this as Personal Communications (email and interviews) as per the examples in the UCA Harvard Guide.
Most AI tools, including ChatGPT, will provide you with a shareable URL of the chat. If so, add a URL to your reference. Some tools, such as Copilot, do not currently provide a URL of the chat. The reference in the bibliography would be the same apart from the lack of a URL. If there is no URL to share, then you should provide a full transcript of prompts and responses from your conversation in the appendix.
Citation example:
When asked who the most influential architects of all time were, Open AI (2025) suggested that many architects have left their mark, out of the seventeen that were listed only one, Zaha Hadid, was female. Copilot (2025) listed five influential architects, one of those was female, again this was Zaha Hadid.
Bibliography example:
Copilot (2025) AI conversation with Badger, I. 13/01/2025.
Open AI (2025) AI conversation with Badger, I. 20/03/2023. At: 
Websites and social media
If you need to reference the AI tool, and not the content that it has produced, then follow the format for Websites and social media.
For example:
Open AI (2023) ChatGPT. At: (Accessed 28/04/2023).
Images obtained online
If the image is recoverable and has a url which can be shared, then follow the format for Images obtained online.
For example:
Fig. 1 Hotpot (2023) Knight in Library. [AI generated image] At: art- generator/8-qCbi0aGbCwDHvnh (Accessed 28/04/2023).
Unpublished Images (created by yourself)
If the image cannot be recovered and does not have a URL, then follow the format for Unpublished images (created by yourself).
For example:
Fig. 2 (2025) Lynx jumping over gate. [AI generated image] In possession of: the author: Canterbury.",2085,,University for the Creative Arts,18.1,,5605,2085,uca.ac.uk,,0:00,,,United Kingdom,"technical documentation, policy, research materials",4.603735110568381,0.3353071798667653,4054,False,2085

If you require a Student visa and wish to study a postgraduate course on a part-time basis, please read our how to apply information for international students to ensure you have all the details you need about the application process.
Why study this course?
This LLM in Legal Practice is a Level 7 course, which can be studied across three semesters (full-time) or five semesters (part-time). It is the most comprehensive postgraduate legal practice course we offer for those wishing to qualify as a solicitor.
Designed for law graduates who want to have the best possible preparation for Parts One and Two of the Solicitors Qualifying Examination (SQE 1 and 2), the Legal Practice (SQE 1 and 2) LLM also includes a dissertation to allow you to achieve a full LLM degree. This means government funding may be available via a Postgraduate Master’s Loan.
To qualify as a solicitor, you will need to pass both SQE exams, hold a degree or equivalent qualification/experience, have two years of qualifying work experience and meet the Solicitors Regulation Authority’s character and suitability requirements.
Preparation for both SQE exams
Gain the knowledge you'll need for Parts One and Two of the Solicitors Qualifying Examination
Gain practical experience
Our Pro Bono Legal Advice Clinic can provide you with up to six months of the qualifying work experience required to qualify as a solicitor
Government funding may be available
By including a dissertation, this course will give you an LLM degree, meaning you could be eligible for a Postgraduate Master’s Loan
Course details
You will be required to have:
- an undergraduate UK law degree with at least a 2:2 classification; or a Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL) from a UK university (with a Grade Point Average of at least 50%)
If you don't have a law degree or the Graduate Diploma in Law, both courses are available to study at the University.
English language requirements
To study a degree at London Met, you must be able to demonstrate proficiency in the English language. If you require a Student visa (previously Tier 4) you may need to provide the results of a Secure English Language Test (SELT) such as Academic IELTS. This course requires you to meet our standard requirements.
If you need (or wish) to improve your English before starting your degree, the University offers a Pre-sessional Academic English course to help you build your confidence and reach the level of English you require.
The assessment for the SQE 1 part of the course exactly mirrors the multiple-choice format of the Functioning Legal Knowledge assessments run by the SRA, so you will be well-prepared for the professional examinations.
The assessment for the SQE 2 part of the course not only reflects the methods used by the SRA for professional purposes, but also includes two additional option modules from a range of subject areas you are likely to meet in professional practice. This will give you an early opportunity to specialise and to make yourself especially valuable to prospective employers within the sector.
The LLM modules will be assessed by a dissertation of 12,000 to 15,000 words.
This Postgraduate Certificate in Legal Practice course is specifically aimed at students who wish to qualify as solicitors, although the knowledge gained throughout the course would benefit anyone working either within the legal or business sectors in any capacity.
Please note, in addition to the tuition fee there may be additional costs for things like equipment, materials, printing, textbooks, trips or professional body fees.
Additionally, there may be other activities that are not formally part of your course and not required to complete your course, but which you may find helpful (for example, optional field trips). The costs of these are additional to your tuition fee and the fees set out above will be notified when the activity is being arranged.

Know where to look
Most graduate jobs are advertised via online job boards or company recruitment web pages. Some professions have specialist sites. Jobs are also increasingly advertised on social media such as LinkedIn.
Check out our pages on finding work to see a list of local employers as well as national websites by sector to aid your job search.
National graduate schemes
It’s never too early to start your job search in your final year as some national graduate schemes have deadlines as early as October.
Why not have a look at the bright networks guide to graduate scheme deadlines 2024
Using recruitment agencies
Many graduates find work through recruitment agencies. You should approach them in a professional manner, as if you were approaching a company directly for work.
A few points to keep in mind:
- Use the Recruitment and Employment Confederation to identify reliable agencies
- You should not be charged by the agency for finding you work. However, some agencies will charge for training
- Specify what companies you don’t want them to contact, eg, your current employer
- Make sure the agencies you contact are appropriate for your skill level.
Work abroad
British citizens need a visa or work permit to work in most countries abroad including the countries of the European Union. You will need to check each country’s individual requirements. To find out more about working abroad and for sources of job opportunities, take a look at:
- Prospects - Working abroad
- Target Jobs - Working abroad
- LinkedIn Jobs (use the location search)
Turing supported international programmes
Depending on the availability of funding and provided you fulfil the eligibility requirements, you may be entitled to some funding for international opportunities after graduation under the UK government’s Turing Scheme. Please contact international.exchanges@ to discuss the possibility of funding to support you on a graduate internship abroad.
Make speculative applications
- Use the job sectors section in Prospects, and information on professional association sites to find out about what is going on in your particular area of work.
- Are you considering both private and public sector employers?
- Consider using social media to investigate employers and find 'hidden' opportunities.
- Focus your efforts on the organisations that interest you the most. Ten quality speculative applications will generally yield better results than making 100 general, unfocused applications.
Apprenticeships
Apprenticeships offer you the opportunity to work and earn while working towards recognised qualifications. Search for opportunities on the apprenticeships pages.
Finally the Office for Students (OfS) has produced a Graduate Employment and Skills Guide for graduates at the start of their career journey.
A postgraduate degree refers to a range of qualifications that require an undergraduate degree to gain entry, these include courses such as Master's and PhDs. A postgraduate course is more than just a qualification.
“Studying a postgraduate course improved my confidence and gave me a professional mindset.”
Solent University offers postgraduate courses, so we’re bound to have something for you to progress onto, whether you want to continue studying your course area or learn a new subject. You can find out more about postgraduate study and the courses available at Solent on the website.

Postgraduate loans
Loans are available for both taught and research master’s programmes (MA, MSc, MBA, MREs, LLM and MPhil) and cover all subject areas. Eligible postgraduate students can take out a loan from Student Finance England to help them pay for their accommodation and tuition fees during their studies. More information can be found on the site.
Postgraduate loans are not available for postgraduate certificates or postgraduate diplomas. You cannot apply for a loan if you already have gained a qualification at master's (or higher) level. You then repay your Postgraduate Loan at the same time as any other student loans you may have.
The repayment plan that applies to postgraduate loans compared to undergraduate loans differs slightly. Further information can be found on the Student Loan Repayment page.

#SolentForLife
You may decide you would like to take some time out to travel and undertake work experience in the UK or abroad. You may just want to have some fun. Whatever you do, make sure you develop skills, abilities and experiences that will enhance your career prospects.
Future employers will expect you to have made good use of your time out. Even if you ‘just travel’ during your gap year, you will develop maturity and independence, increase your self-awareness, and potentially discover new career options too.
Here are some tips and ideas to consider during your time out:
- Consider registering with an employment agency to do temp work.
- Gain voluntary work experience in the UK or abroad.
- Teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) is a popular option. See below for a bit more info about this.
- Don’t get taken advantage of. Research any gap year provider carefully.
- Consider the basics – what, where and when, as well as how much and why.
- A gap year does not have to be abroad and isn’t always a whole year.
- Plan your time carefully to ensure you make the most of it.
- If you are considering working overseas, make sure you check out any visa requirements or work restrictions first.
- Check out the range of gap year ideas and suggestions on .
Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL)
With a TEFL qualification you could find work with a language school in the UK or teach English abroad. Some organisations offer exchange teaching programmes. Opportunities can be found in Japan, China, the Far East, Middle East, and parts of Eastern Europe, as well as Spain, Italy and Germany. A lot of people use TEFL to fund their gap year travel.
Further information about TEFL
Overseas employment
If you are keen to find paid work while you travel, a good starting point for identifying vacancies is the working abroad section on . These articles include information about each country’s job market, and tips on finding work experience, as well as advice about visa and immigration issues.
If you are interested in working your way across the world have a look at which matches volunteers to hosts.
Work contracts
There are a range of different contract types and employer responsibilities that come with each type of contract.
If you need information on your employment or employment rights and ACAS are great sources of impartial advice on your employment rights and best practice by employers.
Freelancers, consultants and contractors
- You are self-employed or are part of other companies
- You will need to look after your own tax and NICs
You may not be entitled to the same rights as workers, eg, minimum wage. Employment law doesn’t cover self-employed people in most cases because they are their own boss. However, if a person is self-employed:
- they still have protection for their health and safety and, in some cases, protection against discrimination;
- their rights and responsibilities are set out by the terms of the contract they have with their client.
Find out more about how Solent supports graduates who work as freelancers or plan to start their own business.
Negotiating salary - the first offer is not always the only offer
Many graduate jobs are advertised without a specific salary. Find out what the range is for the type of role you are going for – through friends, LinkedIn contacts, or other similar jobs being advertised. If you are offered a job you will usually be given the specific salary at the same time.
Do you think the offer doesn’t match the sector, or take into account your skills and experience? Commercial employers often have some scope for improving a salary offer. Be polite and explain why you think the offer should be improved (and not just, I want more money!). Remember that future raises are usually based on your starting salary. You should also consider other aspects of compensation – a shorter commute could compensate for a lower salary, for example.
Understanding your payslip
Check your payslip each month – it is easy to forget if you receive it electronically, but it is vital that you do. If there is a mistake in your favour you might have to make up the money at a later time.
Other Items that are likely to appear on your payslip can include your personal information, the date, court orders and child maintenance, sick pay, maternity/paternity and adoption pay, other deductions, a summary of your year to date, net pay and lastly any important messages that your employer wants to deliver.
Tax and National Insurance information
General information you need to know
Tax rates undergo regular changes, often yearly, so information is not consistently relevant or reliable. There are two main taxes that are directly applicable to all workers. These are Income Tax and National Insurance contributions (NICs).
How do you pay Income Tax and National Insurance?
The way you pay your Income Tax and National Insurance contributions is largely dependent on whether you’re employed or self-employed.
If you are employed by a business, company or organization, it is likely that your Income Tax and National Insurance contributions will be deducted from salary or wages before it is paid to them, through the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) system.
If you are self-employed then it is likely you will pay your Income Tax and National Insurance through self-assessment:
- If you are personally filling in your self-assessment tax returns, you can watch videos and webinars or contact HMRC for general enquiries.
- Self-assessment can be completed with the help of an accredited accountant.
- Help can be found on 
Tax documents to be aware of
What is a P60?
Your P60 shows the tax you’ve paid on your salary in the tax year (6 April to 5 April). You get a separate P60 for each of your jobs.
You need your P60 to prove how much tax you’ve paid on your salary, for example:
- to claim back overpaid tax
- to apply for tax credits
- as proof of your income if you apply for a loan or a mortgage.
What is a P45?
You get a P45 from your employer when you stop working for them.
Your P45 shows how much tax you’ve paid on your salary so far in the tax year (6 April to 5 April).
A P45 has four parts (Part 1, Part 1A, Part 2 and Part 3).
- Your employer sends details for Part 1 to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and gives you the other parts.
- You give Part 2 and 3 to your new employer (or to Jobcentre Plus if you’re not working).
- Keep Part 1A for your own records.
Further information can be found on these websites:
- Self-employed tax and NICs information
- Self-assessment information
- Income Tax information
- National Insurance information
Pension information
State Pension
Once you reach your State Pension age you can start to claim your pension. However, you don’t have to retire or claim your State Pension at State Pension age, you can wait until you’re ready. You can check what your State Pension age will be, and in which year you’ll reach that qualifying age, on the website.
Basic facts
What you receive is dependent on your National Insurance record – this is how much National Insurance you have contributed over the years.
State pension is relevant to graduates as you will likely get a job where you’re earning enough money to start paying NI, which will then contribute to your state pension.
Workplace pensions
All employers are lawfully required to enrol all eligible employees into a workplace pension scheme as of 2018. Contributing to a workplace pension scheme will give you additional income on top of your state pension when you retire.
It doesn’t matter what kind of contract you’re on, if you meet the following criteria you should be automatically enrolled into your employer’s pension scheme:
- Aged between 22 years old and state pension age
- Earn more than £10,000 per year (If you earn less than £10,000, you can still request your employer to enrol you)
- Work in the UK.
More information can be found on website.
Learn to budget
- Set a budget and stick to it.
- Budgeting will help you to clear your student overdraft and prevent overspending. It can also be a useful tool for saving money as well!
There are many useful budgeting tools that can be found on the internet and are free to use. Some examples include:
Why not try a free to use budgeting app, some examples are:
- YNAB (You Need A Budget)
- Wally Lite – Personal Finance
Minimum wage and the living wage
You are entitled to the National Minimum Wage which is published on the website.
Work experience and internships
You won’t get the National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage if you’re:
- A volunteer or doing voluntary work
- On a government or European programme
- Work shadowing
Not entitled to the minimum wage
The following types of workers are not entitled to the minimum wage:
- Self-employed people running their own business
- Company directors
- Volunteers or voluntary workers
- Workers on a government employment programme, such as the Work Programme
- Members of the armed forces
Travel
- Notify your car insurer that you are no longer a student, and of any other changes. For instance, you must notify your car insurance provider if you use your car for commuting to work.
- You may be able to use a railcard to discount your train travel.
- Some employers offer interest free loans for annual travel cards or to purchase bicycles.
Graduate bank accounts
What will happen to your student account when you graduate?
Most student accounts will mature into graduate accounts on their own. However, many have criteria to achieve in order to qualify for their graduate account.
If you don’t meet the criteria, your student account will be converted to a standard current account upon completion of your course. If you cannot meet the criteria for a graduate account speak to your bank about your options.
What to think about when looking for and opening a graduate account
- Don’t be loyal to the bank you held your student account with.
- Get the best 0% overdraft possible.
- Graduate accounts aren’t just for new graduates.
- Never go over your overdraft limit.
- If you’re likely to be in credit, choose a bank offering good interest rates.
Examples of good graduate bank accounts can be found on the Money Saving Expert website.
Your ability to access the best bank accounts will depend on your credit score, you can check your credit score at either Experian or Equifax.
All things money
You may have seen Martin Lewis on telly. His MoneySavingExpert website covers everything from budget planning to going on holiday. It is impartial and worth a look.
State benefits
If you are not moving straight into work when you finish your studies then you may need to apply for benefits while you think through your options and next steps. Graduates may start claiming state benefits after they finish their final term of study in their final year.
Some of the main benefits are listed below:
- Universal Credit (UC) - can be claimed by those on low income or out of work.
- Child Benefit - if you’re responsible for one or more children under 16 (or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training).
- Tax credits - HMRC looks at your income from the previous tax year how many hours you work and whether you’re part of a couple.
Full information on state benefits can be found on the website.
Your local welfare rights unit or Citizens Advice office should be able to give you information about any benefits you may be entitled to receive.
- The Southampton City Council welfare rights and money advice service can help with a range of issues and can be contacted at welfarerights.advice@
- Information on a range of benefits and tax credits can be found on the Citizens Advice website or the website.
Financial help if you’re disabled
There is a wide range of disability-related financial support, including benefits, tax credits, payments, grants and concessions.
The main disability and sickness benefits are:
- Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or Personal Independence Payment (PIP)
- Attendance Allowance
- Employment and Support Allowance.
More information is available here.
Useful information to know if you’re disabled
The Equality Act 2010 protects employees from disability-related discrimination, harassment and victimisation. It also restricts the circumstances in which employers can ask job applicants questions about disability or health.
The law aims to protect a person with a disability from being discriminated against in the selection process. At the same time it aims to protect and provide reasonable assistance to those who choose to disclose.

- Once a disability has been disclosed, it should be kept confidential by the employer unless the employee has made it clear they are happy for the information to be shared or unless the disability is obvious.
- You must disclose a disability or health condition when it might pose a risk at work to yourself or others.
- You may also need to disclose if you require reasonable adjustments. Employers can’t be held liable for not making reasonable adjustments if the candidate/employee doesn’t disclose their disability.
- Timing of disclosure is important. Disclosing a disability prior to interview stage can be useful information for the interview itself. Disabilities can be disclosed at job offer stage too so employers can consider reasonable adjustments. However, disclosing a disability once in the post can be too late. If you were to suffer discrimination at this stage, you may not have a legal case as your employed can rightly claim they were not informed of your disability.
Reasonable adjustments
Reasonable adjustments are changes to the work environment that allow people with disabilities to work safely and productively.
Employers must make reasonable adjustments to make sure workers with disabilities, or physical or mental health conditions, aren’t substantially disadvantaged when doing their jobs. A few examples of reasonable adjustments can be having access to assistive technology, physical adaptations to the working area, adjusting working patterns or adjusting the premises. These can be discussed and agreed directly with your employer. Some of these adjustments can costs (although some are free) but they are a worthwhile investment as it will mean the employee requiring the adjustment will be more proficient.
Law forbids employers from making disabled workers pay for any reasonable adjustments. The employer may be able to use an existing equipment or training budget. In any event the returns made by increasing productivity and reducing days lost to sickness often far exceed the initial costs incurred.
Access to Work scheme
If the help you need at work is not covered by your employer making reasonable adjustments, you may be able to get help from Access to Work.
You should talk to your employer about reasonable adjustments before you apply for Access to Work. Find out more about the scheme here.
Looking for work if you’re disabled
When you’re looking for work, look on adverts and application forms for the Disability Confident symbol.
This symbol means:
- The employer is committed to employing disabled people.
- You’ll be guaranteed an interview if you meet the basic conditions for the job

On this combined Criminology and Law degree, you’ll explore the connections between crime, the legal system and criminal justice.
In your Criminology studies, you'll explore the criminal justice system, analyse the causes of criminal behaviour, look at how crime impacts society, and learn how this can inform policing, law and punishment.
You’ll gain a broad understanding of the law and legal systems. You’ll learn the law, and also gain valuable practical skills that could be used by a lawyer in practice and in a range of related careers.
If you decide not to pursue a career in law or criminal justice, this course will ensure you’re well prepared for a variety of roles that require a similar skill set, such as in governance, public policy and finance.
Why study Law and Criminology?
Criminology and Law are naturally overlapping subject areas, and by studying them together you’ll get to explore the causes, motivations and patterns of criminal conduct, while gaining a deep understanding of the justice system and the law.
Your studies will also cover other legal areas such as business, property, media and employment, giving you a wide range of skills and knowledge that will enhance and broaden your employability prospects.
What you'll learn
In your Criminology studies, you’ll look at crime from a variety of angles and perspectives. Core modules focus on the main theories, debates, issues and research problems in criminology and criminal justice, while optional modules enable you to develop your particular interests.
Our Law modules will introduce practical skills such as case analysis, negotiation and alternative dispute resolution, drafting, interviewing and mooting. You'll have the opportunity to choose from a range of additional, interdisciplinary topics including business and sociology.
We’ll support and encourage you to gain practical experience in relevant fields through voluntary work and placements.
Year one
You’ll be introduced to the key concepts, theories and issues of criminology, criminal law and criminal justice agencies and institutions. In your Law studies, you’ll gain a broad understanding of English legal systems and the British Constitution. You’ll develop skills in case analysis and legal research methods.
Year two
You’ll study contemporary debates in criminology and criminal justice, including a specific focus on policing. You’ll further develop your legal understanding to include subjects such as contract law and EU and international law, and you’ll develop skills of negotiation, advocacy and drafting.
You can choose from a number of optional modules to create a programme tailored to your personal interests. You can delve more deeply into the social divisions associated with crime, and explore areas such as employment law, marketing and entrepreneurship. You'll also be supported and encouraged to take a work placement.
You can choose to take a Professional Placement Year between the second and third year.
Year three
You’ll undertake an original piece of criminological research in an area that interests you, along with comparative study of criminal justice and punishment in a global context.
You’ll have the chance to hone your practice skills with our range of law co-curricular activities, or undertake a law project. You’ll be able to select from a range of modules, a number of which highlight the global dimensions of crime and justice.
We use a range of assessments to gain a comprehensive measure of your performance. Assignments may include essays, book reviews, examinations, portfolios, creative work, contributions to online resources, presentations, reports, in-class tests, reflective writing and individual and group projects.
Your Law studies will include a range of practice based assessments such as drafting, negotiating and mooting.
You’ll learn through a wide variety of activities including lectures, seminars, workshops, one-to-one tutorials, and sessions with visiting speakers. You’ll participate in practical exercises and there may be fieldwork opportunities, such as court visits. Your learning will be supported by our VLE (Virtual Learning Environment).
To find out more about how we teach and how you'll learn, please read our information on Your Learning and Teaching at BSU.
Opportunities
As part of your degree, you could study abroad on a placement at one of Bath Spa’s partner universities.
We strongly encourage you to take advantage of placement opportunities so you can apply your learning in the real world contexts of law and criminal justice.
Practitioners contribute to teaching in some modules and you can find out more from them about working in fields related to criminal justice.
Fieldwork opportunities, such as trips to local courts, will also provide opportunities to observe the legal system in action and learn more about potential careers.
We also have links with local criminal justice organisations including local police services.
A combined qualification in Criminology and Law will prepare you for a wide variety of careers in law and criminal justice, as well as closely-related fields such as social work, policing, crime prevention and security, probation and offender management, and community development.
If you choose not to follow a career in law or criminal justice, the course gives you a range of transferable skills which you can use in a number of other sectors such as health and social care, charities, marketing, HR, teaching and the media.
You may also choose to go on to further study. We offer postgraduate courses in Law through our LLM Law and Business or LLM Legal Foundations, should you wish to practise as a solicitor or a barrister. We also offer an MSc in Criminology, which you can complete on-campus or online.
If you’re a full-time undergraduate student starting your first year at Bath Spa University, you can apply for the Certificate in Global Citizenship, which you’ll study alongside your degree.
You’ll gain global awareness and add an international dimension to your student experience, and funding is available. On successful completion of the programme, you’ll be awarded a Certificate in Global Citizenship. This is in addition to your degree; it doesn’t change your degree title or results.

However, please note that generative AI is evolving rapidly and there is not yet general consensus on how to acknowledge and reference it. This guidance will therefore continue to be reviewed and updated.
Before using generative AI, it is essential you ensure that:
Generative AI can be a useful starting point to gather background information on a topic, but be aware that:
If you do choose to use generative AI tools, you must always:
The use of generative AI must be acknowledged in an ‘Acknowledgements’ section of any piece of academic work where it has been used as a tool to assist in the process of creating the work.
Minimum requirement to include in acknowledgement:
For example:
I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT 3.5 (Open AI, to summarise my initial notes and to proofread my final draft.
Further requirements may be stipulated by a department, academic programme or individual teaching staff, or for a particular assignment, and must be made clear to students when an assignment is set. Additional requirements may include expanded description in the ‘Acknowledgements’ or ‘Methods’ section, such as:
These acknowledgements should not be included in the word count of a piece of work, unless stipulated otherwise for a particular assignment or by a particular academic programme or department. The acknowledgements should either be placed at the beginning or end of the document.
Some referencing styles suggest that AI systems should be cited in a similar way to other sources, most notably personal communications, but there are issues with citing AI systems:
We therefore favour the approach of many academic publishers, which stipulates that AI systems should not be cited as an author, nor included as a source in the reference list.
However, there may be cases where it is appropriate or necessary for you to refer to AI generated output within a piece of work and include it in a reference list, for example:
In such cases, the output should be treated as a work with no author, unless specified otherwise by departmental guidelines or the standardised referencing style you are using.
If you are required to use a standard referencing style which has specific rules for citing and referencing AI, the rules of the citation style should be followed, in addition to acknowledging the use of AI as outlined above. This may require the use of in-text citations and reference list entries where the AI tool is listed as an author.
Examples of how generative AI can be cited in a reference list are given below for the styles that are used at Cranfield University.

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Apps offer students many opportunities to support their learning or work creatively, but over-reliance on these tools could lead to poor academic practice or academic misconduct.
London Metropolitan University is aware of the high-profile discussions and debates about the use of Artificial Intelligence Apps such as MS Bing chat Copilot, ChatGPT and Google Gemini for text and Adobe Firefly, Midjourney and DALL-E for images. The University helps its students to produce their own work with confidence in many ways, including support with understanding assessments, research, academic writing and referencing. This will include navigating the use of new and emerging AI technologies. Our approach to AI is to engage with and adapt to these new technologies, with a focus on appropriate and responsible use.
The University's principles are outlined on the Academic Misconduct pages. For general guidance about the use of Generative AI in your studies, visit the Library's AI Guide
For specific guidance related to your subject speak to your course leader or any member of the teaching staff.
AI and Academic Integrity
Academic Integrity means being honest in your academic work and your studies making sure that you acknowledge the work of others and giving credit where you have used other people's ideas as part of presenting your arguments. Your assessment submissions must therefore always be entirely your own work, based on your own learning and appropriately referenced including how you have used Generative AI. The University regards the use of Generative AI applications by students to deceive to gain unfair advantage as academic misconduct. This usage includes:
- Plagiarism, where AI tools are used to generate output and ideas that are presented or submitted as if they were the student's own work, without proper citation or references.
- Where a complete assignment is created using Generative AI and represented as a student's own work, this will be regarded as contract cheating in the same way as commissioning an 'Essay Mill' or other third party to complete your work.
The exception will be for tasks where the extensive and critical use of a specific AI tool is part of the assessment brief. We also urge caution when it comes to the use of generative AI apps as research tools because the information, they present is not always trustworthy or accurate
- AI tools sometimes invent information and references when they cannot find it. This is called 'hallucinating.'
- They do not always have access to information in books or sites which are in password protected areas or behind firewalls.
- AI tools do not have access to the most recent research.
Because of these limitations, using them without care can have a negative impact on your work.
Further Help and Support with AI
If you require help with your academic writing or research:
1. Speak to your Course Leader they can give you direct subject related advice about the assignments you are working on.
2. Visit The Library's AI Guide
3. Visit Skills Hub, a resource that will help you learn how to find and use information for your studies and assessments.
4. Your school's Academic Mentors can help you to understand is required for your assessment and to find the right resources.
5. Your Academic Liaison Librarian can help you with finding and using information for your studies- a list of them is here

This page contains guidance on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) use in your academic studies, specifically in relation to your assessments. Please take the time to read it carefully - it is designed to support you in your studies. Your academic areas may provide you with further guidance - if they feel it is appropriate - in relation to the specific subject that you are studying, and/or the specific assessment that you are undertaking.
If you have any questions about this guidance in relation to any specific assessment that you are undertaking, please discuss it with your lecturers/tutors/academic advisers in the first instance.

Using Generative Artificial Intelligence to support assessment
We recognise that there is a balance to be had with using GenAI platforms such as ChatGPT, DALLE-2, Micorosft CoPilot, Google Gemini and more (such as ResearchRabbit or Elicit). We want to enable our students to be creative, but also need to protect and maintain academic integrity through transparent practices.
Although GenAI (defined as large language models (LLMs) rather than spell or grammar checks such as Microsoft Edit or Grammarly) can be helpful, it is important to recognise that there are limitations or issues with using these programmes. These include the following: factual inaccuracies, biases and even misinformation; an inconsistent performance in subject areas; variable validity of sources used in searches; referencing issues; “hallucinations” (where a LLM generates false information).
You need to be aware of the difference between an unfair advantage and reasonable use of AI. If you submit an AI generated piece of assessment as your own work, it would be considered as an academic offence. Turnitin has increased capabilities to detect AI use in submitted work.
GenAI platforms can be used reasonably to support your work in the following ways:
- Drafting plans, structures, or ideas
- Answering questions or getting explanations
- Research
- Evaluating materials
- Starting you off on a piece of work when you have writer’s block.
If you choose to use GenAI tools to support your work, you must be transparent about its use to ensure you don’t commit a malpractice offence. An improper use of GenAI will be treated as commissioning. Commissioning is defined in the University’s Academic Regulations as ‘getting another person(s) and/or artificial intelligence to complete work which is subsequently submitted as the student’s own work’
How to be transparent in the use of GenAI
You must acknowledge using AI by naming the tool and how it was used within your references. You should use one of the following options:
- No content generated by AI technologies has been presented as my own work.
- I acknowledge the use of to generate materials for background research and self-study in the drafting of this assessment.
- I acknowledge the use of to generate materials that were included within my final assessment in modified form.
We suggest that this statement is included within your References or Bibliography section towards the end of your work.
Referencing your use of GenAI
You must describe how the information or material was generated (including the prompts you used), what the output was and how the output was changed by you. You should use the following format of wording, depending on the nature of use:
- The following prompts were input into : 
- The output obtained was: 
- The output was changed by me in the following ways: 
Here is an example of how to include the use of AI within your references, in the Harvard style. Please use your department's referred reference style. Referencing guides can be found on the Study Skills help pages:
OpenAI (2022) ChatGPT: Optimizing Language Models for Dialogue. Available at (Accessed: 30 June 2023)
You also need to reference the use of AI in-text. Here is an example of how you should write this: (OpenAI 2022)

London Metropolitan University principles on the use of Generative AI
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Apps offer students many opportunities to support their learning or work creatively, but over-reliance on these tools could lead to poor academic practice or academic misconduct.
London Metropolitan University is aware of the high-profile discussions and debates about the use of Artificial Intelligence Apps to produce text images and other content. The University helps its students to produce their own work with confidence in many ways, including support with understanding assessments, research, academic writing and referencing. This includes navigating the use of new and emerging AI technologies. Our approach to AI is to engage with and adapt to these new technologies, with a focus on appropriate and responsible use.
The University’s principles are outlined below.
1. We permit the appropriate and responsible use of Generative AI applications by our students.
2. We recognise that generative AI applications can be useful tools in specific aspects of learning, including:
- assisting in the structuring or organising existing work.
- getting inspiration / overcoming 'writer's block'.
- spelling and grammar checks.
- supporting international students with language challenges.
- aiding students with specific learning requirements.
- creating prompts for image making.
- creative image making and media production.
- producing quick summaries / synopses of large documents
- other subject specific tasks such as debugging code.
3. We are committed to engaging with generative AI within the context of our wider commitment to equity and social justice (through our ESJF (Education for Social Justice Framework). We will work with students to understand the biases that may be perpetuated by AI and to minimise any inequities in access and usage.
4. Course and module content at London Metropolitan University will be regularly reviewed to ensure the exploration and understanding of emerging technologies, including AI, within specific sectors. We will encourage staff and students to actively participate in sector-wide debates and discussions on emerging issues related to Generative AI and other emerging technologies.
5. We will ensure and maintain fairness in assessment while accommodating our students' access to and innovation with emerging technologies. This will include the use of varied and creative assessments, the active use of version histories where relevant, critical, and creative engagement with AI in class including to explain its unreliability and a focus on subject specific implications within the curriculum.
6. We will support students in their Generative AI literacy within wider learning skills development, assessment literacy, information literacy, digital literacy, and awareness of academic misconduct.
7. London Metropolitan University Students will be expected, when required, to document or reference their use of Generative AI for assessment submissions.
8. We will collaborate with employers, employer networks, Professional Statutory Regulatory Bodies (PSRBs) and other professional organisations to ensure our courses prepare students for the changing recruitment and workplace environment, where AI will be a part of everyday life.
9. The University commits to engage with the broader legal, ethical, and philosophical issues surrounding the use of Generative AI in teaching and learning contexts and other relevant student facing spaces.
10. The University will provide its staff with appropriate training, development, support, and resources to engage with Generative AI, and related issues including Academic Misconduct.
For general guidance about the use of Generative AI in your studies, Visit London Metropolitan University's AI Guide on Library Guides.
For guidance related to your subject speak to your course leader or any member of the teaching staff.
Essay Mills and Contract Cheating/Commissioning
Essay Mills are services that facilitate commissioning and contract cheating. This type of academic misconduct when another person completes your assessment or your work, which is then submitted as your own. It can be hard to spot that these services are not legitimate, often uses terms such as 'proof-reading' or advertising themselves as academic support.
It is now a crime to give, or arrange for another person to provide contract cheating services for financial gain to University students in the UK. Therefore, it is worth noting the dangers of using these services:
- You do not benefit personally or develop by relying on such services and if found out, you could be reported for Academic Misconduct. It does not matter if this is after your degree is awarded. If it has been found on the balance of probabilities that these services have been used to complete an item of assessment, you could have your award taken away after it has been completed.
- You could be at risk of blackmail. Not only could the service inform the University or your employers if you do not pay them money, but they may also not produce the work that you have paid for.
- If found to be facilitating these services or supporting them by advertising them to other students you could be at risk of a Major Misconduct report through our Student Conduct procedures and risk losing your place at University.
There is support, resources and guidance available for students through the Skills Hub to support you with this
It is your responsibility as a student to ensure that you act with academic integrity. If you fail to meet the requirements of academic integrity, this is considered academic misconduct. So if you plagiarise, cheat or do anything that attempts to gain an unfair academic advantage, or you assist others to do so, you are committing the offence of academic misconduct. However, there is support available for students through our Library Study Skills Guides to support you with this.

The Major Project will further develop your research, analytical and critical thinking skills, which are transferable skills highly valued by employers. As an autonomous and reflective learner, you’ll enhance your ability to think systematically and conceptually, construct a sustained reasoned argument and to analyse, synthesise and criticise, while designing proposals for future reforms.
Throughout this LLM distance learning course you will receive expert supervision, online research method and skills training and an online library session with our law librarian which will include how to effectively research using electronic legal databases.
You’ll also have access to our Learning Management System (LMS), Canvas, providing access to a wealth of further research skills information and links to online training tools and resources. Via Canvas, we’ll explain the role of the supervisor; provide training on key legal research methodologies; Major Project writing, referencing and presentation requirements and research ethics clearance, which may be required for some projects, depending upon the nature of the research.
Modules
LLM International Business and Commercial Law Major Research Project
This module will support you in the preparation and submission of a master’s stage major research project and enable you to demonstrate the features associated with academic Mastery:
- The ability to raise significant and meaningful questions in relation to your area of specialism.
- A depth of knowledge that may involve working at the current limits of understanding.
- Critical understanding of method and its relationship to knowledge.
- Awareness of and ability to develop solutions to ethical issues and dilemmas likely to arise in your research and/or your professional practice.
- The ability to draw insightful and justifiable conclusions from information which may be complex or contradictory.
- The capacity to expand, refine or redefine existing knowledge; to develop new approaches and contribute to the development of best practice in your professional sphere.
- The ability to communicate in writing in a clear and cogent manner, consistent with the requirements of academic writing.
- The ability to undertake wide-ranging, independent research, using those methodologies appropriate to the chosen project.
- The capacity to evaluate your work from the perspective of an autonomous, reflective learner.
This module will provide you with an opportunity to explore in depth a particular aspect of international business/commercial law which reflects your academic interest and career development needs (subject to your proposed research question being agreed to by the module leader and your potential supervisor to ensure its viability).
You will be allocated a supervisor to assist you in formulating your research proposal/hypothesis, discuss your methodology (including the possible need for ethics clearance) and act as a mentor throughout. You will be expected to make regular reports to your supervisor on the progress of your work. The supervisory process will normally be conducted through remote supervision via email and/or Microsoft Teams or a similar medium.
Assessment
The LLM is assessed by the written Major Research Project submission of 12,000 words (maximum), which tests your knowledge, understanding, critical evaluation, contextual awareness, research skills and ability to work independently.
How you'll study
Our LLM International Business and Commercial Law (top-up) is studied 100% online.
You’ll study through Canvas, our world-class online Learning Management System (LMS), which can be accessed from your phone, PC or tablet at home or on the move. Canvas provides instant access to study materials, forums, and support from tutors and classmates, as well as enabling easy submission of your assignments.
On successful completion of your studies, you’ll be invited to attend a graduation ceremony on campus. If attending the ceremony in person is not possible then we’ll arrange to have your certificate sent to you.
Supported distance learning
We understand that distance learning is different to traditional campus study and if you’re new to online study you may have concerns or apprehensions about studying your LLM online, and that’s natural.
To help put your mind at ease we have a dedicated Distance Learning Support Team to help and support you throughout your time at ARU, starting with your first online induction and staying with you right through to graduation. In addition, you’ll also be supported by specialist online LLM tutors, well experienced in supporting distance learning students.
Once you start your LLM top up distance learning course, we encourage the creation of online communities, often with the help of Canvas, and many of our learners find these connections with others invaluable, helping them to stay motivated, share concerns or make new friendships.
Contact us to talk through any questions or concerns or visit our support page for more information about the support services available.

What our students say
The support I received fromARU was thorough and greatly appreciated, from top tips, online presentations and one-to-one sessions through skills study plus.
I chose ARU for their recognised global standing, their year-on-year improvements in higher education and partnerships with organisations demonstrated their investment in helping students.
Campus learning was not an option for me, but distance learning allowed me to learn from the comfort of my own home. I do not feel that distance learning has undervalued my university experience at all.

[Staff - for more detailed guidance and support please see the LTE web page.]
Any use of GenAI tools in academic work must be undertaken in a manner which is ethical and transparent. That means that if you have used GenAI to support a piece of assessed work at UON, in many instances you will need to acknowledge where and how you have used GenAI. Not doing so can be seen as academic misconduct. In particular, you should not pass off content produced by GenAI as your own work. You are advised to complete the University of Northampton Plagiarism Avoidance Course, usually known as UNPAC to learn more about academic integrity.
If you have or are thinking about using Generative AI (GenAI) as part of an assessed piece of work at UON you will need to consider carefully what is allowed and how you can acknowledge this ethically in your work.
There are three key steps you will need to take:
For this type of assessment you are unable to use GenAI due to the design of the assessment. For example, a closed book exam where you are required to demonstrate within controlled conditions that you have core knowledge or a skill in a particular area. As it is not possible to use GenAI within this type of assessment, you do not need to acknowledge use of GenAI.
You may make use of GenAI in your assessment in an assistive role, but you must acknowledge this appropriately. Steps 2 and 3 outline the different types of GenAI use, what you need to acknowledge and how you should do this.
Using AI is part of the assessment and will be expected. You must still acknowledge where and how you have used GenAI. Your assessment brief should outline how your tutor wants you to do this.
If you have used GenAI in a piece of assessed work at UON, you must make it clear where and how you have used GenAI output, not doing so can be seen as Academic Misconduct.
If you tutor has provided an assessment brief with instructions of how you should reference GenAI, you should follow those instructions.
If you have not received specific instructions from your tutor, we recommend that you acknowledge use of GenAI using the following guidance:
Some uses of GenAI are seen as 'permitted use' and do not normally require an acknowledgement in your work. These include:
The following uses of GenAI require an acknowledgement in your assessment (see Step 3). Extra care should be taken with 'Higher-risk' uses where GenAI-generated content is added directly to your work.
For each instance where you have used GenAI in your assessment, you should include an acknowledgement. This should include the name of the GenAI software that you used and a clear description of where and how the output was used in your work. If you have used GenAI in multiple ways in a single assessment, for example by creating an essay plan and summarising text, you should include acknowledgements for each of these.
Acknowledgements should be included as appendices in your assessment.
LLS have developed a recommended tool for writing GenAI acknowledgements that can be found below.
The GenAI Acknowledgement Generator is a tool designed to help you write an acknowledgement when you have used GenAI in a piece of assessment work. You should complete each question by including relevant information or including N/A.
When you have completed each section, you can generate and download your acknowledgement. You should then include any of these acknowledgements as an appendix in your work.",2415,,University of Northampton,17.6,,10145,2415,northampton.ac.uk,,0:00,,,United Kingdom,"policy, administrative communications",4.424576502144214,0.4022617124394184,618,False,2415

INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ENQUIRIES
Overview
The LLM in Law and Social Justice is designed to empower students by expanding their understanding of contemporary social justice issues within both national and international contexts. Through a comprehensive examination of relevant legal frameworks, students will gain insight into how legal systems address—and sometimes perpetuate—issues of inequality, discrimination, and social inequity. This law and justice programme goes beyond a theoretical approach, encouraging students to engage in critical analyses of diverse strategies and solutions to these pressing issues. By studying real-world problems and examining various legal and policy responses, students will cultivate a robust understanding of how law can be a tool for social change. A key aspect of the LLM in Law and Social Justice is its commitment to research-led, student-centred, and active learning. This approach places students at the heart of their own learning experience, encouraging them to conduct original research, participate in dynamic discussions, and engage directly with current debates. By doing so, students will develop not only a deeper understanding of social justice but also the practical skills needed to contribute to meaningful change. The programme aims to equip students with the critical thinking, analytical, and advocacy skills essential for identifying, challenging, and proposing solutions to social injustices. Graduates of this LLm degree will leave with the confidence and knowledge required to actively participate in the pursuit of social justice, whether through legal practice, policy development, or academia, fostering a commitment to positive societal transformation.
Highlights
- Focus on contemporary, real-world issues in Law and Social Justice
- Research-led teaching, providing in-depth and specialist knowledge and understanding
- Interactive and discursive workshops
- Applied research project providing opportunities to investigate areas of current concern, and provide solutions

Assessment Glossary
Here is a useful 'Glossary of Assessment' that can help guide you in some of the terminology used at UCA.
- Unit: Self-contained elements of study with defined learning objectives, contributing to a course.
- Assessment Component: Activities undertaken by students to assess the extent to which learning objectives of a unit are met.
- Assessment Criteria: Descriptions of what a student is expected to do to demonstrate that learning outcomes have been achieved.
- Credit / Credit Volume: Numerical value denoting the amount of learning expected for a student to achieve the outcomes of a unit.
- Credit Level: Reflects the depth of learning and intellectual demand required to meet the learning outcomes.
- Resit: Opportunity for reassessment without attendance, usually completed before the start of the next academic year.
- Defer: Postponing an assessment attempt due to mitigating circumstances, allowing assessment as if for the first time.
- Enrol/Register: Processes of joining a course (enrol) and a unit (register) at UCA.
- Retake: Reassessment of an entire unit with attendance in the following academic year, including previously passed components.
- Progression: Movement from one stage to the next in a course, subject to meeting credit requirements.
- Stage: The period of study leading to a formal progression or award point.
- Moderation: A quality assurance process where a sample of student work is reviewed to ensure consistency and fairness in marking and grading practices across different assessors and units.
- Sampling: The selection of a representative subset of student work from a larger cohort for the purpose of moderation or validation, ensuring the assessment process's integrity and consistency.
- Internal Verification: A quality assurance process used at UCA to ensure the reliability and consistency of assessment decisions within the university. This process involves a thorough review of assessment tasks, marking schemes, and the grading of student work by internal staff members. The purpose is to confirm that assessment criteria are applied consistently in the marking of students work, and that the assessment process is fair, valid, and aligned with UCA's academic standards. Internal verification may involve blind double marking, sample marking, cross-marking or moderation [see the level 7 CCF/Taught Course Regulations for more details].
- External Verification: A process involving external experts reviewing the assessment and verification procedures on a course to ensure they align with external standards and requirements. This process typically includes the examination of a sample of student work, assessment tasks, and verification records. External verifiers, who are professionals or academics from other institutions or relevant industries, provide an objective assessment of whether UCA's internal verification and overall assessment practices meet the expected criteria of external accreditation bodies, industry standards, or national educational benchmarks.
- Learning Objective: A specific, measurable statement detailing the desired outcome of student learning for a unit or course, guiding the design of curriculum and assessments at UCA.
- Mitigating Circumstances: Factors outside of a student's control that may negatively impact their performance in assessments, considered by UCA when reviewing assessment results.
At UCA we view assessment as a holistic process that extends beyond measuring academic progress to nurturing creative practice, innovation and experimentation, research and analysis and communication and connectivity within create communities. Embedded through these principles is an unwavering commitment to continually improve the way we enhance diversity and inclusivity within our assessment framework. UCA’s assessments are transparent, equitable, and supportive, providing students with valuable feedback to encourage continuous improvement.
Here are some helpful links to UCA policies, procedures and forms used for assessment:
Assessment Policy The Assessment Policy 2022/23 document outlines the university's approach to student assessments, covering principles of assessment, assurance of academic standards, conduct of assessments, grading, feedback mechanisms, and the security of assessment information. Additionally, it includes specific guidelines on various assessment methods, including portfolio assessments, and addresses requirements for courses linked with professional or statutory bodies.
Feedback forms
This cover sheet must be completed and submitted with all work including essays, Dissertations and practical work (with the exception of oral assessments).
Students must receive a separate Assessment Feedback Form for each assessment component of each unit.
Grading Descriptors
The UCA Grading Descriptors provide a structured and detailed framework to assess student work, ensuring consistency and fairness in grading across all courses at UCA.
- Students can use these descriptors to self-assess their work and understand areas for improvement.
- They can be a guide for setting academic and professional goals throughout the course.
- Helps students understand the feedback from tutors in the context of these descriptors.
- Students and tutors can use these descriptors to track progress over time, ensuring that all essential skills and knowledge areas are being developed.

This UAL guide highlights how you eliminate inequality from formative assessment practices.
Social Justice
Social justice in higher education refers to the efforts and practices aimed at ensuring equity, fairness, and inclusivity within universities. It involves mitigating systemic inequalities that affect marginalised groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, disability, and other identities.
When exploring a social justice model through our teaching, we can be mindful of;
An inclusive curriculum and pedagogy
Developing curricula that reflect diverse perspectives and histories, and implementing teaching methods that recognise and respect the varied learning styles and experiences of students. This includes:
- Incorporating diverse voices in academic content.
- Promoting critical thinking about power structures, inequality, and justice.
- Ensuring faculty are trained in inclusive teaching practices.
Ensuring diverse representation
Increasing the representation of diverse students, faculty, and staff in higher education institutions. This includes fostering environments where diverse identities are valued and celebrated, rather than marginalised. Measures could include:
- Recruiting faculty and leadership from diverse backgrounds.
- Supporting affinity groups and networks for minority students and faculty.
- Promoting diversity in decision-making processes.
Supportive campus climate
Creating a campus culture that is inclusive, respectful, and supportive of all students, especially those from marginalised groups. This can include:
- Addressing incidents of discrimination, bias, or harassment.
- Implementing policies that promote mental health, well-being, and safety for all students.
- Supporting programs that foster understanding and collaboration among different groups.
Addressing systemic barriers
Recognising and dismantling structural inequalities that exist within the higher education system itself. This can involve:
- Challenging policies and practices that perpetuate inequality.
- Conducting regular assessments of institutional policies to ensure they promote fairness.
- Promoting accountability and transparency in addressing issues related to racism, sexism, ableism, and other forms of discrimination.
Economic justice
Tackling the financial barriers that disproportionately affect students from lower-income backgrounds. This includes:
- Exploring avenues to increase financial accessibility for students, such as enhancing scholarships, bursaries, and funding support.
- Supporting affordable housing, food security, and access to technology.
- Ensuring fair wages and working conditions for student workers and adjunct faculty.
Activism and advocacy
Encouraging students, faculty, and staff to engage in social justice advocacy both on and off-campus. Universities often serve as spaces for social movements and change, providing platforms for dialogue and action on societal issues.
Social justice in higher education aims not only to improve access to education for all but to transform the educational environment so that it serves as a space for fostering critical consciousness and creating more equitable, just societies.
The term ""awarding gap"" in the context of UK higher education refers to disparities in academic outcomes between different groups of students. Specifically, it focuses on differences in degree attainment, classifications, and honours achieved by students from various demographic backgrounds, such as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and disability.
The awarding gap is a subset of the broader issue of educational attainment gaps, reflecting disparities in success rates at the end of a course of study. The concern arises when there are noticeable differences in the proportion of students from different demographic groups who achieve the highest degree classifications (e.g., first-class honours or upper-second-class honours).
You can find more information on awarding gaps here:
Office for Students (OfS)
Since January 2022, the OfS in the UK has been actively engaged in addressing issues related to awarding gaps and promoting equality in higher education. The OfS is responsible for regulating and overseeing higher education providers in England. It places a strong emphasis on ensuring that all students, regardless of their background, have equal opportunities for success and are not disadvantaged by systemic barriers.
The OfS has set expectations for higher education providers to actively address and eliminate disparities in degree outcomes. They have encouraged institutions to take a data-driven approach to identify and understand awarding gaps, considering factors such as ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic background, and disability.

The UCA policy on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is embedded in UCA’s academic quality assurance programme. All academic course teams are required to reflect upon ESD in relation to their courses in preparation for course validation and periodic review.
Education for Sustainable Development empowers learners to take informed decisions and responsible actions for environmental integrity, economic viability, and a just society, for present and future generations, while respecting cultural diversity. It is about lifelong learning and is an integral part of quality education. ESD is holistic and transformational education which addresses learning content and outcomes, pedagogy, and the learning environment. It achieves its purpose by transforming society. (UNESCO, 2019)
In late 2022 academic programme directors mapped the content of each course against the United Nations seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). All courses have taught content that engages students on issues relevant to the SDGs, including for example, equality and diversity, climate change and sustainable resource consumption and production. The mapping exercise is ongoing, and the findings will be used to track the how ESD is embedded across the curriculum.
In 2021 UCA’s Business School for the Creative Industries signed up to the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME), where learning will focus on the UN PRME’ s six key principles; purpose, values, method, research, partnership and dialogue, with an emphasis on ethics, inclusivity and sustainability in business.
In 2021/22 the University’s School of Fashion & Textiles (SoFT) launched the UK’s first degree course in digital fashion. The MA Digital Fashion, which commenced in September 2021, is a response to the environmental concerns of fast fashion and the significant market growth in online virtual fashion, through virtual and augmented reality, social media and gaming, where garments are designed for the virtual world.
In October 2019, UCA became one of the founder partners in the BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) Albert sustainable education partnership.
Albert brings the UK screen industries together to tackle their environmental impact and inspire sustainable living: reducing the impact of the production process and being the vehicle for positive environmental change.
UCA’s School of Film, Media and Performing Arts has adopted Albert’s ‘Applied Skills for a Sustainable Screen Industry’ module, which was introduced to provide students with the opportunity to understand sustainability and its professional and personal relevance. The module also aims to equip graduates with the skills to support the industry’s sustainability transition once they are working within it. This year is the third year that graduates of the BA TV production have been accredited by BAFTA as Albert graduates, with 89% of students achieving Albert Graduate certification.
Students are also able to access the Industry Carbon Calculator to work towards achieving an Albert footprint certification for their work, which demonstrates that the environmental impact of their productions have been monitored and measures have been taken to manage and reduce impact.
Decolonising the curriculum in higher education involves critically reassessing and restructuring teaching materials, methods, and institutional practices to address and dismantle the dominance of Western, Eurocentric perspectives. We are seeking to recognise, value, and integrate knowledge systems, voices, and experiences from marginalised communities. The aim is to create a more inclusive and equitable educational environment that reflects a diversity of worldviews, while challenging the legacies of colonialism and systemic racism.
Here are some key strategies to decolonise the curriculum in higher education:
Critically analyse existing curriculum:
- Question dominant narratives: Review the current curriculum to identify Eurocentric or Western-centric biases and narratives. Analyse whose perspectives are being prioritised and whose voices are excluded or marginalised.
- Diversify Perspectives: Ensure that the curriculum includes perspectives from various cultures, especially those from colonised and historically oppressed communities. Incorporate works and ideas from non-Western practitioners and thinkers.
Broaden the focus beyond Eurocentrism:
- Critically engage with the Western canon, incorporating diverse perspectives: While these contributions are important, it’s essential to de-centre them by incorporating diverse perspectives and challenging the assumption that Western knowledge is universal or superior.
- Reframe historical narratives: Colonial history is often taught from the perspective of colonisers, while the experiences of colonised people are marginalised. Decolonising history involves reframing narratives to reflect the experiences, resistance, and agency of colonised peoples.
Engage with students’ lived experiences:
- Acknowledge students’ identities: Incorporate and validate the diverse lived experiences of students. Encourage students to draw on their own cultural backgrounds and experiences in their learning and academic contributions.
- Culturally responsive pedagogy: Use teaching methods that recognise students’ cultural backgrounds as strengths. This involves creating spaces where students feel empowered to share their perspectives and see them reflected in the content.
Promote critical pedagogy:
- Encourage critical thinking about Power and Colonialism: Engage students in critically examining how colonialism, racism, and other forms of oppression shape knowledge production.
- Empower student voices: Promote student-led inquiry and learning, allowing students to shape the curriculum and engage in discussions about decolonisation. This fosters critical awareness and agency in addressing colonial legacies.
Rethink teaching methods and practices:
- Collaborative and participatory learning: Decolonised pedagogy often moves away from hierarchical teaching methods. Instead of teacher-centred learning, promote collaborative and participatory methods, where knowledge is co-constructed with students.
- Acknowledge multiple learning styles: Recognise and adapt to diverse ways of knowing and learning, particularly those that may not align with Western academic conventions. For example, some cultures emphasise storytelling, community-based learning, and experiential knowledge.
Reassess evaluation and assessment methods:
- Critique standardised assessments: Consider incorporating diverse assessment methods that recognise different ways of knowing, such as oral presentations, projects, or community-engaged work.
- Foster reflexivity: Encourage both faculty and students to reflect on their positionalities—how their cultural backgrounds and identities influence their understanding of knowledge and learning. This practice helps to create more inclusive learning environments.
Connect curriculum with social justice:
- Link local and global struggles: Draw connections between local issues of inequality and broader global struggles against colonialism and imperialism. This helps students see how historical colonialism affects contemporary social, political, and economic conditions.
- Encourage activism and engagement: Support students in applying what they learn about decolonisation to engage in activism and advocacy, both on campus and in their communities.
Continuously evaluate and evolve:
- Ongoing process: Decolonisation is not a one-time task but a continuous process. As educators we should regularly revisit and reassess curricula, teaching practices, and challenge policies to ensure they are progressing toward a decolonised education system.
Decolonising the curriculum requires a deep, ongoing commitment to dismantling systemic inequalities and ensuring that education reflects a multiplicity of perspectives, particularly those historically excluded from academic spaces. It is an essential step toward achieving social justice and equity in higher education.

For a more comprehensive version please head over to this link where you will find lots more detailed technical guides on myUCA as a teaching tool such as setting up pages, organising the teaching space and course material, adding content, and much more.
myUCA is UCA’s Virtual Learning environment (VLE). Blackboard is our VLE provider, myUCA is the branding that we have given to Blackboard here at UCA. We use myUCA for a variety of reasons but primarily it is used for the following:
- Delivering and organising teaching content.
- Interaction, communication, and collaboration.
- Links to essential resources.
- Assessment, submissions, marking and feedback
All staff are given access to myUCA when first joining UCA. Your username and password will be the same details as for your email and other UCA logins. Your manager should set you up with your access for courses and units but if you require any additional access to courses and units you can contact us at mycoursehelp@. Google Chrome is the preferred Internet browser for working with myUCA.
Each course at UCA has a main course area on myUCA. The main course area will contain all current students on this course regardless of their year. This area is not used for assignment submission or feedback. It is a community area for all students enrolled on your course. Each unit within your course will have a unit area in myUCA, they are easily identified as the title begins with a code (e.g. FFCP4120). Unit areas are where the majority of teaching information is held including teaching materials, assessments, feedback, and reading lists.
Within the courses and organisations pages, you can search, filter and favourite, which will pin courses to the top of the page. You can also change the layout to show either as a list or tiles. Any courses which you have access to will be listed under 'Current Courses'. You can use the drop-down list to select the courses for a specific academic year.
Marks provides you with a centralised view of grades for your courses including the average grades, what needs grading and submission progress. You can gain all this information without having to go into the courses individually. Students can use this area to access Marks and Feedback for all their units.
Setup for new units
All units in myUCA are created new each academic year from the same template to create a consistent experience for students, and to help you meet the Minimum Benchmark Requirements for all myUCA courses. The template contains the recommended setup and organisation for your units and course areas.
The image below shows an example of what your units will look like when they are first created based off the template. Highlighted in blue are the sections you will need to edit to customise your unit area. The guides below will take you through the steps and how to populate and adapt the area to fit the needs of your course.
All units in myUCA are created new each academic year from the same template. The template contains the recommended setup and organisation for your units and course areas. Once the template units are created, you can then customise them for your course. The setup guide will take you through the necessary steps to customise your units before the beginning of term. Once you have completed setup customisation for your unit, you are ready to start adding content.
These are some of the more frequently used tips for myUCA. For a more comprehensive guide to these and adding content to your course pages, please follow this link.
This guide has been constructed by Anna Whittle and Matthew Drury and has been edited down by the Creative Education team. For a more comprehensive version please head over to this link where you will find lots more detailed technical guides on Panopto as a teaching tool.
Panopto is a video recording, organising, editing and sharing tool that is designed specifically for educational purposes. Panopto is already integrated with myUCA; each course and unit has its own Panopto folder ready for you to add or record video content into.
How to access Panopto
All staff and students at UCA are automatically given a Panopto account. You can access your home folder for Panopto directly here or access your Panopto account through any of your course or unit areas by clicking the 'Panopto Video' icon in the content area. This will take you directly through to that unit's Panopto Folder.
You can then choose whether to use Panopto within myUCA or you can select the pop out icon in the top right hand corner and use Panopto within a designated browser window:
For more guidance this link will take you through a general overview for Instructors of how to navigate and use Panopto within your courses and units in myUCA (Blackboard).

myUCA
Where possible, all assessment submissions should be set up within myUCA. This ensures that all submissions are automatically archived within myUCA for the required period of time and creates a singular point of contact where students can locate their submission boxes, marks and feedback. There are many assessment tools available to you within myUCA to suit a variety of assessment needs. Which assessment tool you decide to use will most likely depend on the type of file the students will be submitting and the type of task set:
In the majority of cases, your Course Administrator can assist you with setting up your submission boxes, assessments, feedback release, and marks in myUCA. However, all instructors can set up their own assessment areas within myUCA as well. For more in depth guidance on how to do this, please follow this link, which will give you a detailed description of each assessment tool and how to set them up in myUCA.
For a brief guide on this, please continue to read. .
Turnitin
A Turnitin box is the best option for submissions that will be mainly text based and need checking for plagiarism such as essays and reports.
Turnitin is a web-based plagiarism prevention submission programme used by most universities in the UK. Turnitin compares text within a student's submission against an archive of internet documents, internet data, a repository of previously submitted papers, periodicals, journals, and publications and provides a similarity report and score for the submission.
At UCA we use Turnitin to:
- Act as a deterrent against plagiarism.
- Provide reports which can help identify occurrences of plagiarism.
- Provide students with a tool to identify and correct possible occurrences of plagiarism in their own work and improve their academic writing.
Requirements for Turnitin submissions:
- Text based Submissions
- Minimum 20 words.
- PDF, Word Document, PowerPoint
- Under 100Mb
Blackboard Assignments:
The Blackboard Assignment tool is the most versatile submission tool as it allows students to submit any type of file as well as multiple files. It has a large upper file size limit of 2.56 GB. The Blackboard Assignment tool is the best assessment option for submissions that will not require text plagiarism checking such as image based content, portfolios.
Blackboard Assignment submissions:
- Any file type accepted
- Multiple files can be accepted
- Large file size limit of 2.56 GB
- Cannot check for plagiarism - Not recommended for text-based submissions.
- Allow group submissions
Panopto Video Assignments
When you are enrolled onto a course/unit in MyUCA as an Instructor, you automatically have permission to create Blackboard assignments. If you need help gaining access to any courses or units, contact mycoursehelp@.
The Panopto Video Assignment tool is a variation of the Blackboard assignment submission tool. The Panopto Video Assignment tool is the best assessment option for video file submissions.

Our MSc in AI also offers practical data analytics, feature extraction, and machine learning skills, tailored to comply with the current market demands, technologies, and industrial practices.
The course is designed in response to the high demand of experts in AI, machine learning, data mining, big data analysis and modelling and will support career opportunities in a range of fields that make use of artificial intelligence including life sciences, human resources, business administration, marketing, psychology, finance and banking.
As well as completing the core modules you’ll need to complete 30 credits of optional modules which allows you to focus on areas of particular interest.
The major project will provide you with a platform to showcase your skills and knowledge on a topic relevant to your specialism, experience, or career aspirations.
Modules
Core modules
Analytical Techniques
This module is intended to provide a general introduction to the analytical techniques needed for artificial intelligence and is tailored for you to develop core maths knowledge that artificial intelligence is built upon. The module will enable you to assess your existing mathematical skills and sympathetically enable you to gain knowledge and skills and/or remedy any basic deficiencies.
The learning topics mainly cover the following areas: basic functions, variables, equations and graphs; linear algebra; probability and statistics. These topics will enable you to have a solid grasp over the most essential maths concepts for machine learning and to explore applying the core mathematical models to problems of regression and classification in a real-life work environment.
Programming with Python
This module introduces high-level computer programming using Python, one of the most powerful yet intuitive programming languages. It is designed to benefit students with no prior programming experience. This module enables you to understand the underlying concepts, principal components, design elements of computer programming and then it gradually leans towards technical aspects of programming by putting theoretical programming concepts into practice. This module employs real-world scenarios and case studies from various industrial domains and practices such as healthcare, marketing, finance, business, etc. to introduce programming concepts and skills. Best programming practice will be taught and used to ensure a maximum level of productivity and quality. In addition, methods and techniques will be introduced and applied to the validation and verification of software quality and standards.
Machine Learning Techniques
Machine learning is a sub-discipline of the Artificial Intelligence that deals with teaching the computer to act without being programmed. In this module, you’ll learn about the tools and algorithms that can be used to create machine learning models. We’ll also investigate how large data sets should be divided into a training set and a test set. Different types of problems that can be solved with machine learning will be introduced; supervised learning algorithms and examples of where they can be applied will be presented. A range of parametric algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, and non-parametric algorithms such as K-Nearest neighbour, decision trees, SVMs, will be discussed.
To be able to evaluate a model, a few performance metrics will be explored. The metrics chosen have influence on how the performance of machine learning algorithms is measured and compared. An important concept that we must be aware of when training machine learning algorithms is 'overfitting'. You will learn to apply regularisation techniques to mitigate overfitting and enhance model performance.
You’ll investigate and experiment with the various models and algorithms covered in the module using standard libraries such as scikit-learn, statsmodels and Python ML packages, gaining practical skills that are directly applicable in real-world scenarios.
Postgraduate Major Project
This module supports students in the preparation and submission of a Masters Stage Dissertation or Project worth 60 credits.
The topic will be based around a project relevant to your specialism and experience. It will be completed solely by yourself as an individual project and, if part of a larger project, the aspect implemented must be clearly identifiable as your sole work. Group projects are not allowed.
The project outline will be formulated and agreed after discussion between yourself and a supervisor at ARU and must meet the objectives of an ARU postgraduate major project.
During the implementation, you will be expected to identify / formulate the problem and issues, conduct literature reviews, evaluate information, investigate and adopt suitable development methodologies, determine solutions, develop hardware/software and/or media artefacts as appropriate, process data, critically appraise and present your findings using a variety of media.
Regular meetings with the project supervisor and workplace mentor should take place, so that the project is closely monitored.
Optional modules
In addition to the core modules above you will need to complete 30 credits from the optional modules below.
Prompt Engineering and Generative AI (30 credits)
The rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undoubtedly one of the biggest technological breakthroughs in modern times. It is provoking a major rethink in many fundamental aspects of our lives including the balance of work between humans and machines, and the foundational knowledge, skills, and abilities that modern humans ought to learn and develop in the era of Generative AI. This course aims to equip you with the crucial skill of prompt engineering and working with Generative AI for efficient task automation, focusing on the art of communicating effectively and systematically with Large Language models to automate tasks and optimise the outcomes. This course begins with a comprehensive introduction to Generative AI, laying the groundwork for an in-depth exploration of prompt engineering. It starts by building a solid understanding of neural networks, deep learning principles, and fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts, essential for effectively engaging with AI models. As the course progresses, it delves into Generative AI models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, the heart of the curriculum lies in comprehending the ground-breaking capabilities of the Transformer architecture, the foundation of modern Large Language Models. You’ll develop the theoretical framework and the practical skills necessary to craft creative tailored prompts for Large Language Models and develop automation pipelines, enabling you to exploit these powerful tools for problem-solving and automation across various industries.
Through practical exercises, you’ll explore topics like the design and development of Large Language Models from scratch, working with state-of-the-art Large Language Models, formulating systematic prompts for optimal interaction with Large Language Models, Working with APIs, task automation, end-to-end data pipelining, as well as content creation. The course also highlights the ethical considerations of using Large Language Models, emphasizing the need for responsible prompt engineering to mitigate biases and maintain fairness in AI applications.
Advanced Time Series Analysis (15 credits)
The module will provide an introduction to emerging techniques allowing data scientists and practitioners to study and investigate nonlinear time series. For example, we will learn how to diagnose whether highly fluctuating and random appearing data are most likely driven by random or deterministic dynamic forces, we will analyse how to detect causality, long-range correlations, define and detect stability in complex systems.
This module will offer a collection of tools designed to dive deep down into underlying structures of data, allowing future data scientists to detect whether stochastic or deterministic dynamics most likely drive observed complexity. In other words, this module will teach how to become 'data detectives ‘accumulating hard empirical evidence supporting their modelling approach.
The teaching material is organised in a way to support graduate students to be familiar with the basic concept of nonlinear dynamics and become operational in nonlinear time-series analysis (NLTS) paving the way for NLTS to be adopted as conventional empirical toolbox in their future studies or professional practice. The approach to the subject will be highly interactive, with hands-on computer experiments in R code directing the students through NLTS methods and helping them understand the underlying logic.
Research Methods (15 credits)
This module helps to prepare a postgraduate student for undertaking research. Its purpose is twofold: to introduce you to the discipline of research and, at the same time, to help lay the essential foundations for a dissertation of MSc quality. Student interests, time constraints and other practical considerations usually set, and limit, the topic, the research approach and study, and the selection of suitable method(s) appropriate for a MSc dissertation. The module therefore includes: - a consideration of research design issues; - an introduction to research skills; - an evaluation of alternative research methods. Topics covered include, for example, research planning and design, alternative research methods, use of the Internet, research analysis and effective time management. During the module, you’ll define an area of study that could or will form the basis of your research project. You’ll be expected to undertake an appropriate and critical review of the available literature and other information relevant to the proposed project. If a laboratory-based project is envisaged, you will need to give consideration to the instrumentation needed, provide experimental design criteria, at least for the first stages of the proposed work, and take account of all health and safety regulations and appropriate ethical considerations. If necessary, you will need to prepare a formal application for ethical approval of your work.
Modules are subject to change and availability.
Assessment
We'll assess you in several ways including time-constrained assessments, coursework assignments, presentations and a project.
Our dissertation project and module case studies assess your ability to analyse situations, identify key issues, select, synthesise and apply techniques and skills from different modules, and evaluate the appropriateness of solutions when compared to industrial practice.
The dissertation artefact will be based on a real-world scenario.

We’ll also organise presentations from a host of different crime and criminal justice organisations, who will explain the services they provide, the careers available in their sector, and how you may be able to help them and gain valuable experience and knowledge by volunteering with their organisation.
Exploring the workings of criminal justice agencies, like the police, courts, prisons and probation service, as well as the wider roles in offender management and crime prevention being taken over by private companies and voluntary groups, will likely help you identify and focus on potential career paths. Undertaking relevant practical voluntary experience can help confirm your career choice, build your skills and enhance your employability.
Completing your Honours-level studies should prove valuable in helping you achieve your career goals.
What can I do with this qualification?
As a graduate, you’ll be prepared to work for a variety of criminal justice organisations, such as the Police Service, Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service, British Transport Police, related private sector providers such as Serco and G4S, and for charities working in areas such as victim support. You may also be attracted to roles offered by security and intelligence agencies such as the Ministry of Defence, the UK Border Force, and Immigration Enforcement, or seek employment in related fields such as Trading Standards and HM Revenue and Customs.
Graduates may move on to postgraduate or professional study, such as a Master’s degree in Social Work, a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) if you wish to work as a teacher, or the LLM Common Professional Examination if you are interested in becoming a lawyer.

Teaching & Assessment
The School of Law at the University of Bolton is led by professionally qualified and specialist staff with a wide range of experience in practice, teaching and research. Teaching and learning on our BA (Hons) Crime and Criminal Justice course is supported by a variety of methods. You can expect lectures, seminars, workshops, practical role play and direct study.
In the majority of modules, formal lectures are used to introduce a topic, with follow-up small group seminars where you’re encouraged to explore this knowledge in greater depth. We’ll offer additional tutorials, ensuring you have space to ask questions or seek individual help. Independent learning is essential for the course and you should spend much of your time reading around and researching the topics covered in your modules.
We’ll also offer you chances to hear guest speakers from local criminal institutions. Moreover, you’ll be strongly encouraged to undertake voluntary activities that support your studies and give you opportunities to gain first-hand experience and practical skills in criminal justice environments.
In terms of assessment, we aim to provide creative ways for you to demonstrate your theoretical and practical knowledge. You can expect assessments to involve report writing, essays, demonstrations, and presenting evidence. An essential element of assessment at Honours level is your dissertation – an in-depth research report that allows you to showcase your critical understanding of theoretical models and contemporary literature relevant to a specific area of thought or practice. Overall, some assessments will contribute to your final module mark and allow you to demonstrate that you’ve met the learning outcomes, while others are designed to help you identify areas that need extra attention on your part, or where you need extra support from your tutors.
Modules
The modules listed below may be a mixture of compulsory and optional. You may not have the opportunity to study all the modules shown as part of the course.
- Rehabilitation: Philosophies and Approaches
- Criminal Justice: Safeguarding People at Risk
- Honours Project
- Practices within the Penal System
- Gender Violence and Society

Teaching & Assessment
The School of Law at the University of Bolton is led by professionally qualified and specialist staff with a wide range of experience in practice, teaching and research. Teaching and learning on our BA (Hons) Crime and Criminal Justice course is supported by a variety of methods. You can expect lectures, seminars, workshops, practical role play and direct study.
In the majority of modules, formal lectures are used to introduce a topic, with follow-up small group seminars where you’re encouraged to explore this knowledge in greater depth. We’ll offer additional tutorials, ensuring you have space to ask questions or seek individual help. Independent learning is essential for the course and you should spend much of your time reading around and researching the topics covered in your modules.
We’ll also offer you chances to hear guest speakers from local criminal institutions and visit criminal justice agencies. Moreover, you’ll be strongly encouraged to undertake voluntary activities that support your studies and give you opportunities to gain first-hand experience and practical skills in criminal justice environments.
In terms of assessment, we aim to provide creative ways for you to demonstrate your theoretical and practical knowledge. You can expect assessments to involve exams, report writing, essays, demonstrations, and presenting evidence and practical forensic crime scene role play using appropriate technology and environments (including police crime scenes and specialist court mock-ups). Some assessments will contribute to your final module mark and allow you to demonstrate that you’ve met the learning outcomes, while others are designed to help you identify areas that need extra attention on your part, or where you need extra support from your tutors.

Introduction
The aim of this tutorial is to equip learners with a critical understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies with a focus on Generative AI (GAI). It seeks to build not only technical proficiency but also adaptability to apply knowledge of AI literacy in real-world context for problem-solving whilst being aware of ethical practices. Co-designed with students, the LEAP Online team and researchers in learning and information technologies, this framework with its four-step approach (i) Prepare (ii) Understand (iii) Apply (iv) Responsible use, ensures that learners build on their existing academic, ICT and digital literacy skills as they progress through foundational, in-depth, practical and responsible aspects of AI technologies integration for learning, research and professional development. Engaging with each of the four core elements is essential for building a comprehensive awareness of AI.
By working through the framework, which is designed to be a guide and a catalyst for thoughtful, responsible and innovative engagement with AI, learners can expect to develop five key GAME attributes – Adaptability, Lifelong Learning, Problem Solving, Self-Awareness and Confidence. These attributes are essential for navigating complexities of AI, enabling individuals to continuously adapt to technological advancements, solve emerging challenges, maintain a reflective understanding of their role in a tech-driven world, and confidently apply their skills in diverse settings.

Assessment
The course is designed to prepare you for the Solicitors Regulations Authority SQE1 standardised assessment and to equip you with the practical skills needed for a diverse range of legal related careers. Our assessment approach emphasises the practical application of legal knowledge and skills to real world issues and scenarios:
1. Multiple-Choice Assessment (Simulating SQE1): You will undertake a multiple-choice assessment that simulates the Solicitor Regulation Authority SQE1 standardised assessment. This assessment is intended to gauge your application of Functioning Legal Knowledge (FLK). This type of assessment prepares you to become familiar with the format and style of questions you will encounter in the formal SQE1 Assessment.
2. Portfolio of Legal Skills Development: You will compile a portfolio recording your practical legal skills development.
3. Optional Module Assessments: The assessment of optional modules will involve written coursework based on real-world tasks and scenarios. This assessment format challenges students to identify issues, analyse relevant rules and principles, and propose practical solutions to actual problems.

Changes to the QMU guidance will be in effect for assignments in semester 2 of the 2024/25 academic year.
Assessment Categories for Semester 1 2024/25
1. Generative AI tools cannot be used
This category applies to those assessments where the format of that assessment makes the use of generative AI impractical and/or where the purpose of that assessment (e.g. the learning outcomes it seeks to assess) means the use of generative AI in that assessment would be inappropriate.3 Students suspected of using generative AI in the production of assignments that fall under this category will be subject to the University’s academic misconduct procedures.
2. Generative AI tools can be used in an assistive role
The use of generative AI to assist in the process of developing the assignment, within specific parameters defined within the assessment specification, is permitted. Students suspected of using generative AI out with those parameters could be subject to the University’s academic misconduct procedures.
3. Generative AI has an integral role
The use of generative AI is permitted throughout the process of developing the assignment and the effective and critical use of generative AI is likely to be one of the learning outcomes being assessed.
Part seven of our self-enrol Study Skills Canvas module focuses on generative AI. There is guidance on different kinds of generative AI tools, information about things you should think about before using generative AI, and information about how you can learn more about using generative AI tools.
All instances of generative AI use in the development of an assignment must be appropriately acknowledged and cited. Cite Them Right includes guidance on citing text produced by generative AI using Harvard and APA styles:
You should acknowledge the use of generative AI in undertaking your work by naming the tools used and the task you used them for.
For example: “In this assessment, I used CoPilot to plan and structure the essay and Grammarly's Writing Assistant for editing.""
Please note: QMU has decided that students do not need to acknowledge the use of Grammarly and Microsoft Editor’s grammar, spelling, punctuation and clarity-checking functions. This means that if you have used Grammarly for spell checking and grammar you do not need to include an acknowledgement of use of AI (even though Grammarly states that the spelling and grammar checker in Grammarly uses AI and that based on available information there is no specific mention of any features or parts of Grammarly that do not use AI).
If you do not wish to use generative AI in your work and would like to make that clear to those marking your work, you can include a statement to that effect.
For example: ""At no point in this assessment did I use generative AI. This includes engaging with the literature, logical organisation, writing, proofreading or editing.""
From Semester 2 in the 2024/25 academic year, the AIAS (AI Assessment Scale) will be used for assessment guidelines:

The Librarians at Birmingham Newman Library have had variable success in asking AI Chatbots to summarise a topic area and recommend some further reading. In this respect, the tools can provide information on the same kind of footing as Wikipedia and other general web-based reference sources. You should therefore treat the information given to you by AI tools in the same way: it is not original, detailed or authoritative enough to be cited in your academic work, but you can use the information to investigate the further reading it recommends. You could also potentially ask it to recommend key words and phrases that you can then use to look for more scholarly and appropriate information sources in Library Search or databases.
You should always keep in mind that, currently, this technology is in an early stage of development and it cannot be relied upon to give you good quality, or very often even true, information.

2023-2028
Whilst the university considers its track record on sustainability to be strong, it also recognises that there is much more that it can achieve.
To do this, it will follow the strategic commitments and the associated action plans within the appendices that map to the UN sustainable development goals.
Sustainability definition
A definition for the 21st century and the scope of the strategy
In recent years, sustainability has become synonymous with key environmental issues, and perhaps most notably, climate change.
However, whilst the university recognises the vital importance it must attach to tackling climate change, it is also be recognised that sustainability initiatives are far broader than focussing purely on the reduction of energy and carbon dioxide (CO2).
Alongside many other topics, waste production, consumption and biodiversity of the campuses are all recognised by staff and students as being vitally important.
UN Sustainable Development Goals
A definition for the 21st century and the scope of the strategy
This approach to broader sustainability issues was recognised by the United Nations (UN) in 2015 when it launched its 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.
These goals span a wide range of topics, including some areas that may be expected, such as ‘climate action’ and ‘responsible consumption’, through to other areas which may be less anticipated within a sustainability framework, such as ‘decent work and economic growth’ and ‘peace, justice and strong institutions’.
The 17 goals are designed to transform the world, and are described as a ‘call to action by all countries, organisations and governments – poor, rich and middle income – to promote prosperity while protecting the planet’. More information is available from the UN website.
Our specific focus on five core UN goals
Whilst targets and aims shall be set for all of the goals, there must also be a focus on a core set of five key areas of importance for the next five years.
The rationale for the additional focus on these five areas is that some of the UN goals will undoubtedly require faster action than others. Other goals may have slightly less relevancy to the university, being primarily aimed at companies or industries involved in manufacture of products. Others may also not require as much focus because the university may already have made good progress against the goals.
Therefore, the five areas listed below are the areas of ‘special focus’. These special focus areas will receive more regular review points and investment will be required in these areas channelled through the Sustainability, Environment and Energy Management Advisory Group (SEEM). These five areas have been identified by members of SEEM and the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) as key areas of importance. These decisions have been also been led by the student and staff sustainability surveys conducted in 2022.
Areas of specific focus
Goal 4 - Quality Education
Ensuring we provide an education experience that embeds sustainability within the curriculum; ensuring we are training graduates for a wide range of future careers who understand current sustainability issues.
Goal 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy
Ensuring that we continue to source 100% of our electricity from renewable sources, whilst driving down our consumption of energy across all areas.
Goal 10 - Reduced Inequalities
Ensuring we reduce barriers to entry to the university whilst ensuring support is in place for both our student and our staff community.
Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production
Reducing our consumption and our waste production.
Goal 13 - Climate Action
Declaring a climate emergency and ensuring we reduce our carbon dioxide emissions and achieve our net-zero ambition by 2045.
Detailed targets and actions plans
The university has produced the following strategic commitments that are outlined in the actions plans below. These actions plans are mapped to each of the 17 UN sustainable development goals.
We must educate our own student body on this topic at the same time as assisting those members of our community who may be dealing with these issues personally.
The challenge
All UK universities need to be able to demonstrate how they are helping to address this problem through their research, actions and education aims. The University of Chichester, as a major local employer, plays a critical role in reducing poverty in our community already, but we recognise we can still do more.
In particular, we have identified that by providing an education experience for those students from poorer backgrounds, which aims to allow them to secure well-paid graduate employment, we can really help to remove intergenerational poverty. Therefore, our aims are to ensure that all of our students can successfully complete their studies, whilst our staff body are both supportive and supported on this journey themselves. Finally, we will work with local stakeholders, such as our local homelessness charity, Stonepillow, to identify how we can continue to support the most under-represented groups in higher education (HE) and to research some of the socio-economic reasons for intergenerational poverty.
The aim
We need to ensure that for our:
- Student access to the university – we need to grow our intake for those students from the lowest household income groups, measured by the indices of multiple deprivation (IMD) and ensure these students successfully complete their degrees with good outcomes
- Student community – we need to continue to provide access to support, advice and financial assistance for those students who most need it, including access to our Student Support fund, bursaries and scholarships
- Research – ensure our research conducted in this area is, wherever possible, co-authored with academics from lower income countries
- Staff community – we pay a fair, living wage for all staff who work for the university whilst ensuring access to staff benefits schemes to reduce their cost of living
- Local community – assist with local projects that aim to end poverty, such as working with Stonepillow who work with the homeless and refugee groups across West Sussex.
Our preliminary proposed initiatives
Ensuring that our own student and staff community isn’t directly affected by this challenge, whilst also contributing toward local, national and international research projects.
The challenge
The ability to feed the world adequately is a key element of the UN sustainable development goals. If done correctly, agriculture, forestry and fisheries can provide nutritious food for all. At the same time, it can ensure rural development with people at the centre of the process, supporting the incomes of those who rely on agriculture.
The University of Chichester and UCSU aims to actively contribute towards aiming to end hunger within our immediate campus communities, whilst helping to contribute towards the global initiatives of achieving food security through our knowledge transfer work with local agri-tech firms, improving understanding around nutrition through our research in sport and health-related programmes.
The aim
We need to ensure that:
- We minimise the risks that our students and staff will suffer from hunger, ensuring those most vulnerable have access to nutritious and affordable food.
- We will consider broadening our food research within nutrition to encompass the area of food hunger.
- We ensure the food that we do procure, either through the SU or our catering partner is affordable and provides choice of vegetarian and vegan options.
- We minimise our food waste within our restaurants whilst also encourage students to minimise their waste within halls.
- We continue to actively research the topic of nutrition through our Institute of Sport, Nursing and Allied Health Sciences.
Our preliminary proposed initiatives
Ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing at all ages is essential to sustainable development: 
The challenge
There are a number of targets associated with this UN goal. These include reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births, ending epidemics such as AIDS, and ensuring additional prevention and treatment of substance abuse globally. Further goals include reducing road traffic accidents and by 2030, reducing by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention, and treatment and promotion of mental health and wellbeing. In addition, the analysis and improvement of sexual and reproductive health-care services.
Overall, this is an area where the university sector can play a crucial role, helping to provide research into the latest forms of prevention, treatment and cure for many of these challenges.
The aim
The university has already made progress on many of these challenges, and this area is one that we are particularly proud of our track record in research and engagement to date. There are over 50 members of staff actively engaged in work within the broader research theme of ‘health and wellbeing’ across several of the institutes at the university. Their research has been published on a wide range of topics from nutrition and health, rehabilitation, primary care and public health and areas linked to psychology such as dementia diagnosis and treatment.
Following the recent successful launch of healthcare programmes, the expansion into additional health-related areas remains a core strategic aim for the university.
Our preliminary proposed initiatives
Ensuring we continue to offer a high-quality education experience to reduce inequalities and improve the quality of life for all: 
The challenge
Chichester aims to provide a quality educational experience. Education is a key gateway which can address inequalities, especially multi-generational challenges. In addition to improving quality of life, access to inclusive education can help equip students with the tools required to develop innovative solutions to the world’s greatest problems.
The aim
As a university, we have focused on all areas of education, from early years, primary and secondary teaching provision through to undergraduate, postgraduate and lifelong learning as a focus. We are participating in the ‘Sustainable Futures’ scheme and aim to incorporate education on sustainability issues across our broad range of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes.
A further aim is to subscribe to UNG 4.7 which states that by 2030 learners should acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development. The university wishes to introduce the opportunity to learn through the curriculum itself, with extra-curricular activities to ensure students leave with an understanding on a broad range of topics including, among others, education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of cultural diversity and of cultures’ contribution to sustainable development.
Our preliminary proposed initiatives
The challenge
The UN has correctly identified that “globally, gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. There has been progress over the last decades, but the world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030”.
As an employer which prides itself on inclusivity, it is vital that the university continues to make progress on gender equality issues. These issues affect both our staff and student body, in terms of pay and recognition for staff and closing any attainment gaps for students linked to gender.
The aim
The university has a strong track record on analysing and publishing gender equality data. The institution will continue to analyse gender equality issues and publish these on the website. The institution will also continue to provide training programmes which aim to develop its staff, as well as women’s networking groups, helping to enable promotion to more senior levels within both academic and professional service areas.
Our preliminary proposed initiatives
Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all: 
The challenge
Globally, three billion people live in areas where the quality of their water is not monitored effectively, whilst over 700M people live in countries with high and critical levels of water stress. Furthermore, water usage has jeopardised the planet’s wetlands with over 85% of these being lost in the past 300 years.
On a local level, Chichester District Council has declared a climate emergency action plan, in part due to the high levels of nitrate run-off flowing into the Chichester Harbour basin from the wider region.
The aim
We need to ensure that:
- The university will aim to reduce water usage, particularly from the piped supply, whilst also reducing our waste water discharge over the next five-year period across both or residential and non-residential estate.
- The university continues to assist with research and consultancy projects which analyse water quality both in the local area and with international application.
- The university will work with Southern Water to develop a series of wetlands, ponds and ditches to reduce surface run-off water and increase biodiversity habitats.
- All accommodation we operate exceeds minimum standards to combat the spread of legionella and other water-borne diseases.
Our preliminary proposed initiatives
The University aims to make further progress in energy efficiency and electrification of our heating systems: 
The challenge
We aim to ensure that the university and its student residents are using energy from renewable sources, which is affordable and ideally locally generated either on our campus or using nearby solar or windfarms.
At present, approximately 64% of the university’s carbon emissions are currently emitted from fossil fuel (gas, heating oil and owned vehicle transport). The university has purchased green electricity since 2008. However, only about a third of this, supplied through the national grid, can be classified as low carbon electricity (source: 2022 ). Therefore, it is essential that we continue to investigate options for generating electricity including both Solar PV on campus and consider use of off-site solar and wind farms.
Finally, we need to monitor and then communicate our energy usage patterns with a view of further reducing our energy use within classrooms, offices and student accommodation settings.
The aim
We will:
- Ensure that our supply of electricity continues to be sourced from renewable energy suppliers.
- Continue to increase the use of Solar PV panels on our campuses to generate more of the electricity used by the university.
- Investigate off-site solar community projects which could generate a high percentage of our energy use.
- Reduce our reliance on gas for central heating applications with energy efficient air and ground source heat pumps replacing old boilers.
- Ensure better visibility of energy usage with improved communication to our staff and student body on how to save energy both on and off-campus.
- Continue to monitor our energy usage by building, and aim to expand to corridor level in order to identify issues causing energy wastage.
- Deliver (via SEEM) energy savings ideas to ensure CO2 reduction.
Our preliminary proposed initiatives
The UN states that this goal relates to “promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated the worst economic crisis in decades and reversed progress towards decent work for all”.
The challenge
Although the global economy began to rebound in 2021, bringing some improvement in unemployment, the recent conflict in Ukraine means that the recovery remains fragile. Rising inflationary pressures, major supply-chain disruptions, policy uncertainties and persistent labour market challenges have presented issues to both the University itself and our wider communities.
The institution itself is challenged by a funding situation which has seen the standard undergraduate fee – the major source of funding for most institutions – held static for over a decade. In the context of rapidly rising inflation, which drives up costs of staffing, utilities, maintenance and building projects, the university must grow to achieve the economics of scale it now requires. It also needs to seek opportunities for diversification to generate more income without placing further pressure on the existing estate.
The aim
On growth, as the undergraduate tuition fee is held static, then the University has committed to growing our intake and diversify our operations in order to ensure our financial position remains positive. This will mean an increase in postgraduate and international students which should help to mitigate against any potential decrease to UK undergraduate demand or reduction in tuition fees should a new government come to power.
On decent work, we aim to provide:
- Our staff with a high quality work experience, with adequate training opportunities and excellent HR processes to provide a secure working environment.
- Our students with opportunities for careers advice to prepare them for their own futures.
Our preliminary proposed initiatives
The UN Goal is summarised as “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation”. The University of Chichester can play a key role in all three of these aims.
The challenge
There are eight targets associated with this UN Goal, but the ones most relevant to the university are:
- Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human wellbeing, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all.
- Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries.
- Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per one million people and public and private research and development spending.
Fundamentally, where the university already plays a key role is the fostering of innovation and serving the needs of industry both locally and abroad.
The aim
Our intention is to:
- Grow our research which is relevant to industry and research conducted with industry itself.
- Continue to offer degree apprenticeship training opportunities for local and national employers.
- Increase the number of patents and spin-off companies and our research income from industry.
- Continue to operate business support services, such as the Business Hothouse project, to assist small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
- Continue to offer expertise and research options for businesses who have identified an operational need.
- Work to develop knowledge transfer partnerships with employers within the South East.
Our preliminary proposed initiatives
The challenge
Reducing inequalities affects many of the other UN Sustainable Development Goals. From a student perspective we can act to change inequalities by seeking to educate a diverse range of students reflecting the varied communities of our region. This includes students from areas where there are lower rates of progression to higher education, first-generation families (those who haven’t studied at university before), those with disabilities through to students from developing countries.
From a staff perspective, we need to ensure we have support in place for under-represented groups, we champion diversity and provide accessible facilities for staff and students.
The aim
We need to ensure that the university aims to:
- Increase the proportion of students from lower participation neighbourhoods/first in family students. The university will engage in a programme of aspiration and attainment raising with a number of schools and colleges in the region through its Compact Plus partnership. As well as the Student Recruitment and Outreach team, this will involve academic staff and students developing mutually beneficial relationships with the partner schools and colleges.
- Increase the proportion of students of a black or minority ethnicity studying through awareness-raising of the university at schools and colleges with a more diverse population, including ‘Back to Sixth’ visits, where possible, from current students. Engage with current students and review success and progression data to identify how attainment and progression gaps may be reduced.
- Provide an effective disability advice and support service during, and after, the application process with continued provision of disability accommodation support and rooms available.
- Ensure we have appropriate guidance and policies in place to support students and staff with matters of anti-discrimination and harassment.
- Create and maintain an environment for staff which embraces and promotes equality, diversity and inclusion through structures, policies and processes.
Our preliminary proposed initiatives
The challenge
Much of the world lives in cities. It is estimated that 56% of the global population now lives in cities, compared to 36% fifty years ago. A United Nations report in 2018, predicted that these figures will reach 68%, equating to two in three people by 2050. There are a number of drivers that have pushed people into urban centres, including the search for better education and higher-paid jobs, and the impact of our changing climate which makes rural areas less habitable.
As they have grown, our cities have generated more and more carbon emissions, and now contribute around 70 % of the world’s CO2 emissions from energy. As cities are responsible for such a large proportion of CO2 emissions, they are a good target for changes that could alleviate the impact of emissions on the world’s climate.
With the Bishop Otter campus being located on the outskirts of Chichester city and our Bognor Regis campus being located in an urban area, the university has an important role to play in sustainable practices within the local area. A sustainable community must have access to its history and culture in order to thrive. Our Bishop Otter campus was founded in 1839 and our Bognor Regis campus contains buildings of Georgian architecture, therefore the university acts as a custodian of heritage and environment in the local community.
The aim
We need to ensure that the university aims to:
- Carry out research on how to make our cities more sustainable
- Reduce waste going to landfill
- Maintain our public access to our campuses and increase access to our buildings across campuses including libraries, art collection and performances
- Maintain our public access to the open spaces on our campuses, including our sports facilities
- Apply the transport hierarchy, producing policies and setting targets for sustainable travel
- Increase our support of performances and productions that attract members of our local communities
- Provide and/or ensure affordable housing is available for students and staff.
Our preliminary proposed initiatives
The challenge
Unsustainable patterns of consumption and production are the root cause of the triple planetary crises – climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.
Current world practice follows a linear economic model of ‘take, make, throw away’, in which resources are extracted, turned into products, used and discarded. To disturb this unsustainable model, a circular economic model needs to be adopted where products are designed to be more durable, reusable, repairable and recyclable and therefore kept in circulation for as long as possible. Change to the way in which we consume and use goods and services also need to be made. Much of the world’s economy is based on producing things for consumption. This drives the engine of industry. If we want the world to develop sustainably, we need to understand how to be more responsible at both ends of this cycle. This means promoting resource and energy efficiency, having a sustainable infrastructure, and providing access to basic services for all.
The aim
- Reduce the consumption of goods, particularly single use items, by the university and our students.
- Ensure life cycle costing and the circular economy is considered in procurement decisions.
- Minimise the amount of waste generated by our activities.
- Minimise waste sent to landfill and maximise that recycled.
- Ensure the ethical sourcing of food and goods.
Our preliminary proposed initiatives
The challenge
Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing our planet. Carbon dioxide levels have increased by about 45% since before the industrial revolution. Other greenhouse gases have increased by similarly large amounts. All the evidence shows that this increase in greenhouse gases is almost entirely due to human activity. About 43% of the carbon dioxide produced goes into the atmosphere, and the rest is absorbed by plants and the oceans. This is causing changes to our oceans, droughts and natural disasters, which are all increasing at an alarming rate.
Our Student Union Sustainability Officer writes: “Climate change is the greatest challenge that young people as a collective will have to face going forward. The fight for our planet is important and taking precedence in climate action only affirms the need for change. Therefore, it is an impending necessity for the academic and social institutions that represent these collectives of young people to show progress in affirmative climate action. If we as an academic institution do not act in an interest for climate action, then surely we become complicit in the contribution to the rise of CO2 emissions. Regardless of whether our CO2 emissions have little impact nationally or internationally, we can still think about the risk to our community and the local area. From the perspective of the student body, climate action is viewed favourably and not engaging with climate action would be seen negatively. More importantly, the larger impact of structural climate action within the university hierarchy will lead to student empowerment on the issue.”
The university has had considerable success in achieving carbon reductions and has invested over 2.6M in energy efficiency projects across the ever-expanding estate. Potential future developments are expected to increase the size further, along with a significant increase of students living on campus. This increase in estate size and student numbers will have a continued proportional negative impact on energy usage and operating costs. It is essential therefore, that we continue to reduce our carbon emissions by adopting a wider range of energy efficient technologies and seek opportunities for sustainable power generation.
We also have a responsibility to reduce emissions indirectly caused by our activities, such as the commuting of our staff and students, the purchasing of products and services and the way we travel on business.
There is a very striking comment in the IPPC’s special report on global warming of 1.5oC published in 2019, which states: “Every bit of warming matters, every year matters, every choice matters.”
The aim
- Commit to being a net-zero carbon university according to the greenhouse gas protocols scopes 1 to 3 by 2045.
- Continue to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.
- Continue to reduce our energy consumption.
- Increase our percentage of energy use from low-carbon sources, such as renewables and other power generation sources.
- Develop and then share our Climate Management Plan.
- Commit to educate our staff and students to ensure they are aware of the carbon impacts of their choices and feel motivated and support to take action.
Our preliminary proposed initiatives
The challenge
The oceans and rivers and watersheds that link to them are the largest part of our ecosystem. 40% of the world’s population lives within 100km of the coast, and we all rely, directly or indirectly, on the sea. Oceans comprise 99% of the earth’s liveable habitat and produce half of the oxygen in the earth’s atmosphere. The ocean absorbs around one quarter of the world’s annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, thereby mitigating climate change and alleviating its impacts.
Yet, our oceans have never been more threatened. Pollution, global warming, unsustainable fishing and degradation of natural habitats are threatening marine and coastal biodiversity. The existence of terrestrial species, including humans, depends on life underwater. If we do not stop polluting our oceans, there will be severe problems that affect every person and living creature on the planet.
Our Bognor Regis campus is located within a 10-minute walk of the south coast and our Chichester campus is located just outside the Chichester canal basin. These locations provide our staff and students with a tangible feel for our impact on water bodies and the ocean. In addition, the Aldingbourne Rife runs through our Bognor campus and we have created our own ponds to enhance the aquatic ecosystem on this campus. However, we need to do more to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of water bodies including lakes, ponds, streams, wetlands, rivers, estuaries and the open ocean.
The aim
- To ensure that we maintain and extend our current ecosystems’ biodiversity through the approval and implementation of the biodiversity action plan 2023 to 2028.
- To ensure food supplied from the oceans is sustainably harvested.
- To reduce plastic waste on campus.
- To implement a policy to reduce water usage and prevent marine pollution from all activities, including land-based activities and construction.
- To collaborate with the local community to maintain shared aquatic ecosystems.
Our preliminary proposed initiatives
The challenge
Life on land is a precious resource and we need to ensure that it is passed on to future generations.
The UK is now one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, due to centuries of industrialisation, the intensification of agriculture and extraction of natural resources. Large areas of habitats have been lost with 99.7% of fens, 97% of species-rich grasslands, 80% of lowland heathlands, up to 70% of ancient woodlands and up to 85% of saltmarshes destroyed or degraded.
The impacts on species have also been severe, with a quarter of mammals in England and almost a fifth of UK plants threatened with extinction. A third of British pollinator species has also declined.
As demands on the land are set to increase with a growing population requiring more water to drink, food to eat and places to live, the university has an obligation to protect its campuses and the broader ecosystem.
The aim
- To ensure that we maintain and extend our current ecosystems’ biodiversity through the approval and implementation of the biodiversity action plan 2023 to 2028.
- To ensure sustainably farmed food is used on campus.
- To ensure land-sensitive waste disposal.
- To ensure local biodiversity is included in planning and developments on and off campus.
- To provide education to staff, students and the local community on biodiversity impacts and initiatives.
- To collaborate with local communities to enhance shared ecosystems.

Artificial Intelligence Guidance for Students
We’ve all heard about the on-going and exciting developments of artificial intelligence (AI) in the media, including the capabilities of sites such as ChatGPT and Google Bard. These are fascinating tools which have the power to change the way we think and work.
However, as an academic institution, we need to ensure they are used responsibly. We’ve created this AI guidance for students to help you understand BNU’s position on AI tools and their use.
BNU’s position on the appropriate use of AI
BNU holds the view that Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a useful tool for learners in their studies and for future employability. Nevertheless, it is important that the work you present is original and authored by you, ensuring it is underpinned by the principles of academic integrity. To facilitate this, we provide the following guidance to clarify what we define as the appropriate use of AI at BNU.
At BNU we define appropriate use of AI tools within your studies to mean that you may use AI software as a tool to assist you in the development of your ideas (please see below for some examples). However, the work you create and submit needs be your own. Improper use of AI tools during assessments could result in academic integrity investigations about the authenticity of your work which could result in penalties.
Generative AI can be used appropriately as tool to support you in creating your own work.
Examples:
- Assistance in exploring ideas for your assessment
- Assistance in developing a plan for your assessment
- Assistance with spelling and/or grammar
- Assistance in time-management for your assessments during your modules.
- Any work that is awarded marks or credits within any module must be created by you.
- Learners should not use AI as a tool to paraphrase work that is not your own.
- You must provide your interpretation of the work you read.
Learners can use AI-generated materials to assist with your assignments, like adding images to a presentation (as long as the image is not a graded part of the assignment). All elements of your work that are assessed as part of the module (e.g. a piece of art or a musical score) must be created by you and not be generated by AI. It is recommended that you talk to your module leader before submitting your work to ensure any plans to use AI generated material are appropriate.
Any work you submit must be entirely your own, this has not changed. Work that is considered to be plagiarised will be investigated as academic misconduct and could be subject to penalties. The University may also investigate previously submitted work for academic integrity even after you have graduated if there is a cause for concern raised. This could have implications on your degree outcome being revoked. It is therefore essential that you have confidence in all your submitted work as being your own creation. For further information you can access BNU’s policy on academic integrity and the academic assessment regulations.
When you are researching for an assessment, it is important to consult a variety of academic sources. In the same way that you should not rely on one book to complete an assessment, you should not rely on AI platforms as a main source of research. Learners should use the recommended module reading lists via Keylinks as their initial sources of research, followed by a library search.
Your work and its main content must be created and written by you. Make sure you do not ask AI to create content for you. An important component of your degree is the demonstration of your skill in the English language at the suitable level for your course. Therefore, you must not use AI to write your ideas for you, although it can be used to suggest ways of improving your writing.
If you use AI at any stage in the development of your work you are required to provide a reference to demonstrate how you have used AI it. The University expects that you follow the guidance set out in Cite them Right for the referencing style you are required to use in your course.
An example is shown below for clarity:
In-text citation When prompted by the author, Copilot responded with a ‘definition of appropriate referencing’ (Microsoft Copilot, 2024). A copy of this response is in Appendix 1.
Reference list
Microsoft Copilot (2024) Copilot response to Ravinda Sharma, 10 October.
Any work generated by AI should not be copied and pasted directly into your assignment. Although it is generally discouraged to include quotes of AI generated text within your work, if it is appropriate to then please follow the Cite Them Right link above for how to quote AI generated text.
Not all countries allow the use of AI generative software. Make sure you're aware of the law and the potential consequences of violating it, such as disciplinary action or even criminal charges. In 2021, the UK government introduced new laws that make it illegal to commission someone else to write work for you that you then submit as your own in higher education. This includes using essay mills or similar services to obtain work. Always ensure that the work you submit is your own and that you haven't tasked someone, or something, else to write it for you including AI.
If you have any questions or concerns about the use of AI, we recommend you speak to your module leader, course leader, personal tutor or Student Learning Achievement (SLA@). If you have any concerns about assessments you have already submitted or are concerned about meeting future deadlines, please contact your course team, the SLA or Academic Registry who are all here to help you.
Your wellbeing is the most important thing and if you are concerned or feeling stressed, please speak to someone in our Student Hub. There are a number of teams around the University on hand to support you. Read this guide to find out which team is best placed to answer your query or concern and how to contact them.",2037,,Buckinghamshire New University,15.3,,5115,2037,bucks.ac.uk,,0:00,,,United Kingdom,"policy, administrative communications",4.408520891220737,0.423679060665362,1034,False,2037

The Project
Mobile apps can be considered to be in a state of continuous beta release with minor and major releases being issued regularly. As always, changes bring the risk of (re)introducing errors to previously working code, necessitating regression testing to eliminate such unwelcome side effects. Testing user interfaces in particular can frequently be a manual and tedious process, which is at risk of human error due to inattention, missing particular paths, etc.
There are some promising approaches to automating some of this testing, and so this research would seek to investigate artificial intelligence and/or computer vision techniques that can address this problem. We already have one company interested in providing exemplar real-world apps and data sets to support this research. The student will have also access to the University’s new multi-million-pound DigiTech centre, based on the Adastral Park site, which boasts state-of-the-art machines and an AI Compute Server.
Candidate Requirements
Applicants should hold, or expect to receive, a First Class or good Upper Second Class Honours degree (or the equivalent). A master’s level qualification would also be advantageous but not essential.
Knowledge of, or a strong interest in mobile app development, software testing and artificial intelligence would be useful.

The Project
The protection of personal data is becoming increasingly important, particularly with respect to the explosion of internet and cloud-based services that make use of personal data as part of a revenue generating business model. The use of (fully) homomorphic encryption techniques has been demonstrated in recent years to be privacy preserving for a growing number of applications, for example gene imputation. The techniques currently require in-depth expert knowledge of cryptography, but recent work (for example at Microsoft) has begun to investigate compiler technologies that would make privacy-preserving encryption accessible to software developers. This research would involve the development of advanced compiler models and software libraries that will then enable service developers to build privacy-preserving tools without needing to know anything about the personal data of an individual. It is expected that one or more cross-discipline case studies will be developed in particular application areas to demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of the research. The student will have access to the University’s new multi-million-pound DigiTech centre, based on the Adastral Park site, which boasts state-of-the-art machines and software dedicated to cyber security.

The Project
The use of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) to assist in the investigation of alleged crimes is a well-established approach, with organisations such as Bellingcat carrying out ground-breaking work in obtaining and analysing possible evidence from online sources. One of the essential criteria for assessing potential evidence is that of credibility – it is often a non-trivial task, even with dedicated tool support, to sift through large amounts of potentially relevant information to assess the veracity and relevance of one or more datasets. Techniques from artificial intelligence (specifically machine learning) offer promise here, and this research would aim to develop models and corresponding implementations which could help to speed up OSINT analysis and investigation.

The Project
Background and Motivation
Messenger RNA–or mRNA– is an essential component of all living organisms. mRNA is a messenger - it interacts with other components in cells, carrying instructions to make a specific protein. mRNA delivers these instructions, or “blueprints” so that cells can put the protein together. Once this process is complete done, an mRNA is broken down by the body.
mRNA teaches human bodies how to make their own medicine – COVID19 mRNA vaccines are only one of the examples where mRNA can be used to give cells directions to make a particular protein. Cardiovascular diseases are another area of application, where studying the proteins missing or produced by such groups of patients can help scientists produce a treatment plan or new medicines.
The structure of mRNA is still not fully mapped and still holds secrets for scientists, and this project explores the idea of using Machine Learning or more specifically, Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing to explore novel ways of extracting patterns and genes and protein information from mRNA sequencing data.
Project Aims
The aim of the project is to work with mRNA sequencing data from cardiovascular disease patients employing methods widely used in detecting patterns in text data from the machine learning and deep learning to study the structure of mRNA and detect its minimal units from existing sequencing data.
The applicant will initially be working on public datasets available in the machine learning and bioinformatics community and inhouse sequencing datasets held by the Suffolk AI (Artificial Intelligence) Research Group members. Machine and Deep learning models will be developed by the student to take multi-modal data as input and generate the high-quality representations as mentioned above. At a later stage, a new dataset would be constructed, and novel algorithms will be developed upon that to answer the challenging questions within this topic and beyond.
Facilities
PhD researchers affiliated with this project will be based in our state-of-the-art DigiTech Centre at Adastral Park, launched in the summer of 2021. A collaboration between the University of Suffolk and BT, with funding from the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP), the centre has been established to provide training in innovative digital skills for people looking to pursue careers in the nationally essential information and communications technology (ICT) sector, as well as fuelling high tech businesses who increasingly require access to a talented technology workforce.
The centre houses four high-end computer laboratories complete with industry-standard software and tools and a dedicated high-end AI server. In addition, PhD students will have access to dedicated comping labs at the Atrium building, in Ipswich, technology focused communal areas, full access to the library resources and other on campus facilities.
Candidate Requirements
Applicants should hold, or expect to receive, a First Class or good Upper Second Class Honours and/or a postgraduate degree with Distinction (or an international equivalent). We also consider applicants from diverse backgrounds that have provided them with equally rich relevant experience and knowledge. Full-time and part-time study modes are available.

The Project
Background and Motivation
The Industry 4.0 concept aims to the deployment of a large amount of sensor and actuator devices forming an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) network. Such IIoT information systems can collect data from all over the shop floor or agricultural unit and can be aggregated to the edge of the network. Edge computing, Edge Intelligence and Federated Machine Learning have been playing an important role in that ecosystem, which heavily rely on the integration of diverse technological solutions to build an intelligent manufacturing ecosystem through the amalgamation of customization, predictive maintenance, digital twin, web-based systems, open connectivity, etc. Edge intelligence, i.e., artificial intelligence (AI) applications with edge computing (edge AI) for training/testing or inference, is an important element for IIoT applications to build a model that can learn from the high amount of aggregated data.
Predictive maintenance is a method of preventing future machinery failure by analysing data during production to detect abnormalities ahead of time, so appropriate measures can be taken before damage can be done to the production line. With faults and failures forecast well before their occurrence, saving money and time for businesses and manufacturing companies, implementing predictive maintenance programs in manufacturing sectors requires condition monitoring of equipment's critical variables and then deploying intelligent techniques to predict the occurrence of failure. The data processing and predictions in predictive maintenance can be ventured as Edge AI techniques, which will be more feasible options for small- and medium-scale industries.
Project Aims
The applicant will work with the supervisor and other academic staff within the Digital Futures and Suffolk AI Research Group to define their specialised area of work depending on their expertise, speaking to one of the areas above. The School and the Digital Futures Institute has excellent links with industry, and it is expected that the project will benefit from direct input and collaborations with local manufacturing partners and cross-pollination of ideas (EDF Sizewell, Openreach BT, Celotex among others).

The Project
Previous research into shared participation in recreational experiences has shown to positively contribute to factors such as wellbeing and experience enjoyment (Boothby, et al., 2014; Boothby, et al., 2016). Additionally, there have been recent exploratory studies aimed at better understanding player perspectives with regards to shared recreation (Haqq & McCrickard, 2020). What is not currently clear, are the underlying mechanisms that contribute to a gameplay experience that is not only enjoyable, but also promotes socially meaningful interactions and other factors such as connectedness with nature.
The goal of this project, is to make contributions to the exergame and interdependent play space for the purpose of improving a person’s physical and mental wellbeing. It is expected that the PhD student will engage in a body of research aimed at understanding and establishing mechanisms that contribute to this area of game design and also design and build such games that can be played by the general public. Typical outcomes will involve submitting theoretical and practical work to annual conferences such as Foundations of Digital Games and CHI PLAY. At the University of Suffolk, you will have access to our state-of-the-art games lab, the specialist laboratories in our DigiTech Centre, as well as other relevant facilities such as our Sports Science lab.
Candidate Requirements
Applicants should hold, or expect to receive, a First Class or good Upper Second Class Honours degree (or the equivalent). A master’s level qualification would also be advantageous but not essential.
Knowledge of games development and/or programming is essential. It is advantageous to have a working knowledge of univariate statistics but this is not essential and can be learned throughout the PhD.

About the project
The School of Technology, Business and Arts at the University of Suffolk is inviting applications for the following project.
The Project
AI systems are frequently portrayed as being complex, unpredictable and often prone to ‘hallucination’. Treating the development of an AI system as an inherent engineering problem, the current products, services and literature point to a significant absence of software engineering best practice. The title of the project is deliberately derived from Dijkstra’s seminal book ‘A Discipline of Programming’, which advocates for a structured and rigorous approach to software development. Arguably such discipline is missing from the current ways in which Machine Learning (ML) systems are currently designed and built.
This research would focus on the development of sound engineering principles and practices to support the development of robust, testable and maintainable AI systems, using as a foundation the core principles and experience generated from the many decades of software engineering best practice. For example, models, techniques and tools developed for best practice in software architecture, design techniques using Data Flow Diagrams, Threat modelling techniques, best practice programming techniques and testing frameworks at all levels will be ‘repurposed’ to create bespoke equivalents that put AI systems development on a much stronger engineering footing, bringing benefits of traceability, maintainability and understanding that is currently missing. Tools to support Intelligent Machine Engineering will also be produced, for example design tools and IDE plugins.
Candidate Requirements
Applicants should hold, or expect to receive, a First Class or good Upper Second Class Honours degree (or the equivalent). A master’s level qualification would also be advantageous but not essential.
Knowledge of Machine Learning techniques and libraries, software engineering principles and IT systems development best practice would be useful.

The Project
The classical perimeter-based approach to cyber security, which focuses most attention on securing a network boundary, is becoming less appropriate particularly for cloud-based architectures, where users, applications, servers, and access devices can be globally dispersed and varied. Moreover, a perimeter-based security solution will not guard against insider threats, as users or devices located within the perimeter are assumed to be ‘safe’. The approach of Zero Trust Architectures (ZTA) instead places emphasis on users, attributes, and resources, assuming instead that every type of access is untrusted and the mantra of ‘never trust, always verify’ is applied throughout a system. Frameworks exist for ZTA, however actual implementations are few in number for various reasons.
Related to the lack of concrete ZTA examples is the fact that even those that exist rely upon standard cryptographic techniques for authentication and access control. There is much interest currently in quantum technologies, and it has already been shown that (with a sufficiently powerful quantum computer) existing public-key cryptographic techniques, which secure the whole of the internet, could be broken easily. ZTA solutions, therefore, will need to address this issue to ensure that future implementations will be quantum-robust, and currently there are several Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) solutions that NIST are in the process of finalising as standards for digital signatures and key encapsulation/exchange.
This PhD work will build on research that is currently under way at the University of Suffolk to create a robust ZTA example implementation that can also be suitably modified to ensure post-quantum safety.
Candidate Requirements
Applicants should hold, or expect to receive, a First Class or good Upper Second Class Honours degree (or the equivalent). A master’s level qualification would also be advantageous but not essential.

The Project
Computing systems and software can and does aid in addressing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals through reducing travel (communicate via video conferencing rather than commuting), calculating fuel-efficient logistics, smart agriculture, and so on. All of these are the use of computing for sustainability. Unfortunately the manufacture, operation and disposal of computing resources has a large environmental cost and as data centres and AI applications have grown in popularity, so has the contribution of the information and computing technology sector to total greenhouse gas emissions. By 2018, it was estimated to have reached 4 to 5% (twice the emissions from air travel). Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies and modern data centers have been reported as placing significant strain on national energy infrastructures. This research is therefore focused on the sustainability of computing and what techniques can be employed to reduce energy consumption and hence the carbon/greenhouse gas footprint of computing use, specifically software.
In previous research, we have found intriguing and unexpected insights in the relationships of energy usage versus performance, task complexity, and execution speed for real software components. We would like to expand our understanding of the factors underpinning energy consumption of different type of software components and especially where software components have unexpectedly high performance and energy costs. The end goals of this research will be how to determine whether a particular software component is “sustainable” and how we can develop software that is more energy efficient in terms of programming and software engineering

The Project
Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Copilot and Llama [1] are becoming a big part of our daily lives. They are used everywhere—from helping businesses write reports to assisting students with assignments, and even answering casual questions [2]. However, as great as these tools are, they can also create problems. Sometimes the information they provide isn’t correct, and in other cases, their answers might raise ethical or safety concerns [3].
The problem gets worse when people rely too much on these tools without a way to check if the information is accurate or safe [4]. For example, students might use wrong facts in their reports, researchers could include errors in papers, and misinformation might spread quickly online. This can lead to serious issues, especially in fields like education, healthcare, and public safety.
The goal of this research is to create a ""Watchdog LLM""—an AI system designed to keep an eye on how these LLMs perform. It will test and rate them based on how accurate, unbiased, and safe their responses are, especially when it comes to sensitive or controversial topics.
Objectives:
- Automated Evaluation of LLM Outputs: Develop a specialized framework to generate prompts and evaluate LLM responses based on their alignment with ethical standards, correctness, and unbiased representation of information.
- Bias and Sensitivity Detection: Identify and quantify biases in responses that may marginalize specific groups or propagate stereotypes.
- Safety Assurance for Vulnerable Audiences: Ensure that content generated by LLMs is appropriate for young users, particularly in the educational sector.
- Trust and Transparency Enhancement: Build a rating and scrutiny system that increases public trust in LLMs by exposing limitations and providing actionable feedback to developers.
Research Impact:
The Watchdog LLM will address some of the biggest concerns people have with AI tools:
- Building Trust: It will help the public trust LLMs by showing which ones are reliable and which need improvement.
- Stopping Misinformation: It will catch errors and biased responses before they can spread widely.
- Protecting Kids and Teens: It will make sure young users aren’t exposed to harmful or false information, especially in educational settings.

Teaching & Assessment
We use various teaching and learning methods to help you acquire and develop the appropriate skills, concepts and knowledge needed to succeed in your studies. Our blended learning and teaching style includes online delivery and engagement where appropriate.
You'll be expected to attend formally-timetabled classes with tutors, such as lectures, seminars, tutorials, discussions groups, guest speakers and masterclasses. We'll use a combination of live sessions and online and practical work as appropriate. You'll also need to undertake a significant amount of personal study, including activities such as background reading, preparing for seminar activities, working on assignments, and revising for exams.
The assessment strategy aims to help you achieve the overall aims of the programme and the learning outcomes for individual modules. As well as being a way to assess your achievement, the assessments also help you organise and develop your learning. Assessment feedback can help you build skills and understand your strengths and weaknesses.
There are two types of assessment: formative and summative. Formative assessments help you learn and develop your knowledge and skills, while the results of your summative assessments provide your grades. Formative feedback is given face-to-face, online or in written form. Summative assessments tasks are linked to each module's learning outcomes, and you'll need to complete these before the end of the module. Module assessments typically involve written coursework, project work, oral assessments and portfolios. You'll also receive feedback for summative assessment, usually in writing, with the opportunity to receive a more detailed verbal explanation.
If your first degree is not in law or your first language is not English, we strongly encourage you to take International Business Law as your first option. This module will provide you with an overview/foundation in the principles of legal systems.

Finding out information from reliable sources, communicating with others safely, creating digital content, and even shopping online all need some level of digital skills.
The University Of Northampton has collated some resources for our students to enable you to assess your current abilities and improve upon them. Please continue reading below to find out more about the available tools and how to interact with them.
The University Of Northampton has subscribed to a system provisioned by Jisc called the discovery tool.
Jisc are a not-for-profit organisation that believes technology improves education and research. As part of their mission, they created the discovery tool to help students self-assess their digital capabilities, identify their strengths, and offer opportunities to develop their skills further to enhance their practice of learning. The tool also includes a set of questions to help you to better understand your capability and proficiency with AI and generative AI tools.
The University encourages our students to make use of this tool to better understand your digital capabilities against a framework so that you are equipped to improve upon them. The tool is made up of questionnaires for self-assessment and online resources for self-development.
Please start with the question set titled 'New Students' for the best introduction to understanding your current digital skills. Relevant resources to enhance your skillset will appear once you have completed the question set. The AI question set will also provide you with a basis to self-assess your skills and knowledge of what AI is and how it could, or should, be used in the context of your studies.
The discovery tool can be found here: Jisc Discovery Tool
Guidance on how to log in and use the tool can be found here: Student guide
The University Of Northampton has provisioned all students with access to a comprehensive suite of educational videos and courses via the LinkedIn Learning online platform. There are more than 5,000 courses on a wide range of topics.
Some of the resources you will be presented with after completing the Jisc discovery question sets are on LinkedIn Learning. You will need to sign in to this system in order to view the resources. Please use your usual University login credentials.
LinkedIn Learning can also be accessed directly at:
Further information for students, including a full user guide, can be found on the UON webpages.
Improving your digital capabilities is a lifelong endeavour. Even when you feel confident with all of the digital tools you use in everyday situations right now, there will be further developments with technology that may require attention in the future. Luckily, with your new found skills, you are now a digital learner capable of becoming familiar with any new developments thrown your way! Below are some suggestions on continuing your development.
Use your new skills in 'finding information and resources' to discover new developments and keep on top of trending technologies. If your JISC discovery tool results suggest you are less confident in this area, then it may be worthwhile focusing on this skill. The ability to conduct research autonomously will be instrumental to your continued learning. With every new digital development, there are numerous resources made available on the web to support your adoption of the tool, software, or resource.
Digital skills development is a large undertaking and sometimes you may not fully appreciate the progress you have already achieved. Keeping a brief learning log or journal may help you to identify the value you add throughout your journey. Reflective writing is an important skill in itself. If you are not yet familiar with how you might approach this, there is support for University of Northampton students and further information to get you started on the Skills Hub.
The Jisc discovery tool has the option to retake each question set multiple times. The results are overlayed so that you can quickly view progress over time. Simply revisit the tool, log in as before, and retake the question set. Viewing an improvement in your self-evaluation may well increase your confidence further!
If you found these resources helpful, please consider helping others to make use of them. Now that you are a confident digital citizen, there is nothing more rewarding than passing on what you have learned to others, thus perpetuating your own skills in teaching, coaching, or leading within the digital stage.
The obvious way to help is to highlight these resources to your fellow students, but maybe there is more you can do. Perhaps one of your own family members would appreciate some help learning about online banking or shopping, or maybe one of your peers has let you know they are struggling with something specific like note taking in class, for example. How might you assist? How can you help improve their confidence?

Creative education is amid a major shift.
With global challenges intensifying and creative industries rapidly evolving, the call for fresh, forward-thinking teaching has never been more pressing. This year’s conference theme of Innovative Practices in Creative Education, focuses on how we can embed bold, responsive, and impactful approaches into creative education, shaping graduates who aren’t just skilled makers, but also critical thinkers, ethical innovators, and agents of change.
We’ll consider how emerging technologies, such as generative AI, can enrich creative work and how business and entrepreneurial thinking might complement arts curricula. This broad perspective challenges traditional models and invites us to reimagine what we teach, how we teach, and why it matters.
At the core of this year’s theme are authentic learning and practice-based research approaches that connect education with real-world contexts, encourage hands-on experimentation, and foster collaboration across disciplines. By placing these methods front and centre, we aim to explore how creative education can empower students to engage more deeply with their work and spark meaningful innovation. Alongside this, the conference continues to foreground our shared responsibility to shape a more sustainable future, asking how creative education can lead the way in developing greener, circular economies.
We invite provocations, case studies, and research that show how innovative approaches to creative education can drive cultural, environmental, and economic impact, ultimately preparing students to thrive and lead in our complex, interconnected world. By engaging in these forward thinking dialogues, we can shape a creative education future that responds to uncertainty and equips both ourselves and our graduates to adapt and lead with purpose in a rapidly changing world.
Creativity for a Sustainable Future: Redesigning Learning, Culture, and Industry panel discussion
As industries across the globe pivot towards sustainability, creative education and design learning have a vital role to play in shaping new knowledge systems and future-proofing skills. This panel will explore how the intersection of creative education, learning, and design can drive the green and circular economy, both in the UK and internationally.
We will focus on how cultural organisations, museums, and creative institutions can act as catalysts for innovation — embedding sustainability into practice, fostering critical thinking, and leading change through inclusive and forward-looking educational models.
The discussion will consider:
- How creative education can influence sustainable industry practices.
- How design thinking can reframe solutions for circular economies.
- How cultural and creative institutions can serve as hubs for reimagining learning.
- What skills, mindsets, and frameworks are needed for the future of creativity in a rapidly evolving global landscape.
Panel's insights and expertise would be invaluable in shaping this important conversation about the future of learning, creativity, and sustainable design.
For this discussion, we are excited to be joined by:

Gen Edelmann
Gen Edelmann is a creative educator exploring happiness and playful pedagogy in design education. Her teaching embraces curiosity, learner autonomy and imperfection by using hand-on playful approaches to challenge perfectionism and reframe failure as a critical tool in design education.
Presentation title: Perfect Failure: Embracing Imperfection through Playful Pedagogy
How might we reframe failure as a powerful pedagogical tool rather than a mistake? This session challenges perfectionism in creative education by embracing risk, play, and vulnerability. By examining how failure can be reimagined as a vital part of creative education, it also invites a rethinking of curriculum design itself—where failure is not a by-product of creative risk, but a deliberate and valuable part of the learning experience. Rooted in playful pedagogy ‘Perfect Failure’ reimagines the studio as a collaborative space for experimentation, where vulnerability, play, and imperfection become central to critical and creative development.

Presentation title: ‘Cooking Up Assignments Together: Illustrators Approach Decolonising the Studio-Classroom’
Students & teachers unite! This session will explore how decolonising the curriculum can be approached hand-n hand with students. Beginning with the idea that decolonising the curriculum is about more than wider participation and inclusion, we will discuss ways in which students can develop the confidence to deal with complex and sensitive real-world issues. A novel call and response format will investigate how self-reflective, action-based activities can be used to deconstruct, and subvert, traditional top-down pedagogic hierarchies, and evolve into meaningful and rigorous outward-facing academic research and artistic practice for students.

Presentation title: Taking the viewpoint of a Dyslexic student
Imagine navigating a world where words dance and twist, creating barriers instead of bridges. I was diagnosed with dyslexia at a young age and have gone through the journey as a student and into becoming an educator. This presentation aims to put you in the mindset of a dyslexic student, feeling the stress of trying to achieve tasks and seeing the barriers to learning that this can bring.
Join me in this presentation as we explore the unique perspectives, challenges, and barriers that come with Dyslexia, underpinned by primary research gathered whilst studying for my master's, which partially focused on creating ‘A Visual Representation of Dyslexia for Non-Dyslexics’. To focus on how formatting and delivery can change these barriers to learning into bridges.
Together, let’s foster understanding and celebrate the diverse ways we all learn!

This practical workshop encourages a radical reimagining of the spaces within art and design schools. Participants will be invited to respond to a series of prompts that encourage critical reflection in relation to their own lived experiences and the ecosystems they teach within – with a focus on sharing practice, challenges and initiatives. We will use speculative design methods to think through collective making, working collaboratively to build the art school of the future.

Presentation title: Exploring the value of arts-based pedagogies to support education for sustainability’
“What ESD requires is a shift from teaching to learning… for an action-oriented, transformative pedagogy, which supports self-directed learning, participation and collaboration, problem-orientation, inter- and transdisciplinarity “(UNESCO, 2017:7).
I believe that one of these transformative pedagogies is art-based pedagogy. I will share examples and methods I have explored to embed ESD into the Creative Business foundation course that I teach at UCA. The opportunities and benefits that art-based pedagogy offers to support education for sustainability.

There are also well-publicised issues with LLMs giving out misleading, unethical, false and sometimes dangerous information.
However, there can be legitimate uses for this new technology, and its potential use in teaching, learning and research is still a long way from being fulfilled.
Some potential legitimate ways you could use AI tools in your university work include:
There may be occasions when your tutors specify that you should use Generative AI to support your work. If your tutors tell you that you have to use it, you should use it.
For example, as a computer scientist you may be studying the information and technological architecture behind AI; or as a social science or humanities student you may be interested in researching the way that these tools affect human behaviour and interaction.
This is how tools such as Grammarly work. When you use AI tools like this, you must not ask it to provide extra intellectual material that you have not found in your own reading and research. You should use tools for this task sparingly and carefully proof-read its suggestions to make sure they are making the same sense that you intended.
You could enter some of your writing into an AI tool and ask it to comment on any improvements that could be made to your writing, and to explain the significance of these improvements. You can then reflect on the proposed changes and learn more about how to write effectively in an academic style.
An AI tool could tell you some of the key points that you might want to consider when you are approaching a topic that is new to you. However, it is still important to include your own original thoughts and ideas – AI should only be used as a starting point when used in this way.
This could help you with the searching process when using Library Search, databases, or general search engines such as Google.
Currently, the Library recommends caution and careful evaluation of any information an AI tool provides when using it for this purpose. Depending on the question and the AI tool, it may provide you with details of literature that does not exist. There are some browser plug-ins that can be used to help spot these ‘hallucinations’, although none produce perfect results. If you are using AI tools in this way, you must also possess the skills to check if a reference is real or not, and the knowledge to know how you can access it.
Summarising a topic area, theoretical idea or a specific part of your reading to help your understanding or to help you find a way into your work. You may do this by:

That’s why we have developed a wide range of opportunities that you can take advantage of alongside your chosen programme to enhance your offering to future employers and reach your full potential.
Digital badges
The opportunity to showcase your skills to prospective employers via your social media profile has become increasingly important and for some of our programmes you can earn digital badges that recognise your accomplishments. The badges are widely recognised by employers as a mark of expertise and dedication.
Employability skills are increasingly important to prospective employers who are looking for applicants with something more to offer than just subject knowledge.
Our course modules provide learners with the core transferable employability skills they need to go on to have a successful career. We have developed the Cranfield Competency Framework to help our learners to identify and reflect on those skills that they have acquired, or those that need further development. Competencies are clustered under four different groupings: Communications and Relationships, Personal Attributes, Leadership and Business.
All students are enrolled on to the Digital Credentials programme and this is launched through an interactive workshop. Find out more on our employability skills page.
Being entrepreneurial isn’t only about running your own business, having an entrepreneurial mindset is all about thinking differently and creatively to solve problems. Through our entrepreneurship programme of activities, we can help you become resilient, resourceful and solutions-oriented.
Entrepreneurship is a fantastic opportunity to expand your knowledge, build your skills and meet students from across campus in a friendly and fun environment. Through our Cranfield Enhance Entrepreneurship offering hosted by the Bettany Centre for Entrepreneurship, you will become more resilient, cultivate your problem-solving skills, encourage creative thinking and resourcefulness, and learn valuable soft skills such as communication, negotiation, leadership, and teamwork, which are essential in your personal life and professional career.
The entrepreneurship badge consists of two levels. Level 1 (which consists of two badges) will offer you the opportunity to:
- attend speaker series, entrepreneurship club and entrepreneurship week events.
- participate in the Cranfield Start-Up Weekends.
- participate in the Colworth Innovation Challenge.
- participate in the i2i programme (research students).
In addition, if you would like to move to level 2 (which consists of two badges) you can:
- attend two masterclasses.
- sign up for mentoring with the Bettany Centre.
If you complete all four badges you may also have the opportunity to apply for the Cranfield Seed Fund.
At each level and for each badge, you will attend specific events and workshops before submitting a written deliverable.
You can find out more in the following links:
- Entrepreneurship: Ideation
- Entrepreneurship: Inspiring
- Entrepreneurship: Impact of Research
- Venture: Developing Entrepreneurship
- Venture: Getting Ready for Launch
As the opportunity to showcase your skills to prospective employers via your social media profile has become increasingly important, you will earn digital badges that recognise your accomplishments once you have successfully submitted each deliverable. Employers widely recognise the badges as a mark of expertise and dedication.
If you are studying for a PhD, you have access through our Doctoral Researchers Core Development programme. It offers a suite of resources enabling you to develop transferable skills that are important for personal development and career progression.
Digital skills underpin everything we do at Cranfield and how we do it. Recent reports and surveys have highlighted the importance of relevant, up-to-date digital skills both for study and for work.
To help you to enhance your digital skills we provide a self-assessment tool to discover how your skills levels compare against the six elements of the Jisc Building digital capabilities framework. There are also two specialist question sets covering digital skills in AI and generative AI and digital skills for employability. Jisc is the UK's expert body for digital technology and digital resources in higher education, further education and research.
The Jisc discovery tool enables you to self-reflect on your current digital skills and provides a personal report indicating your current skill level, access to resources and next steps to further develop your skills.
To support your development and fill any skills gaps identified we offer a range of learning opportunities and resources:
- a rolling programme of free online or classroom-based courses.
- self-paced resources including online learning tools and video tutorials; plus free access to LinkedIn Learning
- access to professional digital skills qualifications and certifications.
- one-to-one support.
The Jisc discovery tool provides digital badging for some questions sets, and on completion of a LinkedIn Learning course you’ll receive a certificate.
If you would like to know more about the Jisc Building digital capabilities framework or the Discovery tool, please email us at bdc@.

York St John Pedagogy
A statement outlining our approach to teaching, learning and assessment.
The York St John Pedagogy is an overarching, thematic statement which explains the fundamental principles and practices of learning, teaching and assessment at York St John University.
It does this in a way that aims to be relevant and understandable across all subjects and levels within the University, and which enables us explain clearly to community partners why our approach to higher education is valuable. The York St John Pedagogy focuses on why and how we teach, whilst reinforcing our commitment to values-based curricula.
We are committed in our pedagogy to:
- Encouraging critical thinking and creativity to tackle social justice issues and urgent societal challenges
- Identifying and reforming teaching, learning support, or assessment practices that contribute to awarding gaps or an inconsistent student experience
- Decolonising curricula and pedagogy, and adopting anti-racist teaching practices
- Consistently and holistically implementing inclusive practices
- Aligning with the University Mental Health Charter
- Promoting ecological justice by embedding the UN Sustainable Development Goals in our curricula
Our statement of why we teach and support learning in the ways that we do supports and builds on our ongoing efforts to improve educational quality. It outlines our vision for the future, endeavouring to address key issues for students, such as the climate emergency, rapid technological changes like generative AI, and uncertainties about future job opportunities. It also acknowledges the growing mental health and wellbeing challenges for both students and staff. In these ways the York St John Pedagogy aims to show how our educational methods will continue to evolve to meet the urgent challenges faced by students and the higher education sector.
The pedagogy is also designed to enhance our performance against key sector measures of success, such as achieving high rates of student satisfaction, increased educational equity and helping more students find meaningful jobs or continue their studies.

When designing assessments for your course, it is important to consider the vulnerability and resilience of each assessment type in relation to the use of generative AI. A useful tool for the evaluation of your assessment is the AI Risk Measure Scale (ARMS), developed by the University of Greenwich (De Vita and Brown, 2023).
CPD activity for AI and authentic assessment is provided through the Centre for Excellence in Learning and Teaching and can be booked through the CPD calendar.
Assessment and AI at Suffolk
We have undertaken an evaluation of AI vulnerability of the most commonly used assessment types at Suffolk, using ARMS. Key insights from the evaluation are:
- AI risk is very much subject to interpretation, design and organisation of the assessment.
- The ever changing nature of AI technology means that assessments which are generally considered AI resilient have become more AI vulnerable in recent times, e.g., videos.
- Design and organisation of the assessment is crucial to increase AI resilience.
- Authentic assessments will typically be more AI resilient by design.",2549,,University of Suffolk,15.1,,3175,2549,uos.ac.uk,,0:00,,,United Kingdom,"policy, research materials",4.472446860016543,0.6136363636363636,180,False,2549

Changes to the QMU guidance will be in effect for assignments in semester 2 of the 2024/25 academic year.
Assessment Categories for Semester 1 2024/25
1. Generative AI tools cannot be used
This category applies to those assessments where the format of that assessment makes the use of generative AI impractical and/or where the purpose of that assessment (e.g. the learning outcomes it seeks to assess) means the use of generative AI in that assessment would be inappropriate.3 Students suspected of using generative AI in the production of assignments that fall under this category will be subject to the University’s academic misconduct procedures.
2. Generative AI tools can be used in an assistive role
The use of generative AI to assist in the process of developing the assignment, within specific parameters defined within the assessment specification, is permitted. Students suspected of using generative AI out with those parameters could be subject to the University’s academic misconduct procedures.
3. Generative AI has an integral role
The use of generative AI is permitted throughout the process of developing the assignment and the effective and critical use of generative AI is likely to be one of the learning outcomes being assessed.
Part seven of our self-enrol Study Skills Canvas module focuses on generative AI. There is guidance on different kinds of generative AI tools, information about things you should think about before using generative AI, and information about how you can learn more about using generative AI tools.
All instances of generative AI use in the development of an assignment must be appropriately acknowledged and cited. Cite Them Right includes guidance on citing text produced by generative AI using Harvard and APA styles:
You should acknowledge the use of generative AI in undertaking your work by naming the tools used and the task you used them for.
For example: “In this assessment, I used CoPilot to plan and structure the essay and Grammarly's Writing Assistant for editing.""
From Semester 2 in the 2024/25 academic year, the AIAS (AI Assessment Scale) will be used for assessment guidelines:

The Quality Assurance Agency’s webpage Quality Assurance Agency: Chat GPT and Artificial Intelligence is recommended as a ‘go to’ source of information, as it is regularly updated with useful guidance and resources.
The QAA has produced a set of resources at its Academic Integrity pages. These resources include briefing papers on cyber security, essay mills, and Artificial Intelligence. You will also find the Academic Integrity Charter on the QAA website. QMU has signed up to the Charter and the seven principles therein.
